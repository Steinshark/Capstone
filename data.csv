"umm so I uh went to the academy. umm so I guess graduating there. and like that whole switch thing they talked about whatever was I don’t know was kinda real and that was it for me.  I think so just cause you get to know the guys around here and when I was a tad for a year at annapolis too and I lived with four other guys who are in this class too just going through together was pretty cool. umm  I think so I don’t like being uhh bottom of the barrel kinda thing umm. and ya I get like a closet competitor uh. I’m not out there like screaming at everybody just a mild brain I don’t like to salute and stuff. umm I don’t, really I like following things through too that factors as well. ","I always grew up playing sports, I was a wrestler. umm training for that always just trying to be best of the best always no matter what. I did I went to a small school in new York called Suny Brockport uh I wrestled there and graduated with a BS . uh I had to put a lot of time into studying I don’t pick up things as fast as other people you . umm probably work hard I think umm put a lot of time in to train for buds. umm I uh originally was in class 306 and ended up DORing from hell week so I came back six years in the fleet came back here and went all the way through with 338. 306. yep . Uh I was an IT so I worked with radios . yes . thank you . um I would say I don't know the word a hard work ethic um I was more of an extrovert than most people . um I I always try to go out of my way to help people when they needed it and they would always try to help me if I needed it . it was kinda like I don’t know I always go out and try my hardest with pretty much everything I did",um besides BUDS. um ya I think BUDS BUDS is by far the biggest one. I have to imagine that will uh be everyone's answer on that question. before that. oh that’s a good question. ya i mean college I’m thinking if anything stood out as particularly difficult um overall kinda patterns carried out I wouldn’t say there was any sort of. hardship growing up that I had to do um I did get my pilot’s license um that was pretty difficult .  so that was probably one of them but there was no growing up family hardship. uh probably the same lessons you get um when you go to college or getting your license it’s applicable to BUDS um you learn attention to detail um you know you learn to both those both college and pilots license are just not something you achieve overnight so it is probably you get out of surveys you are working for a goal for a long period of time and you can't really give up halfway through that goal similar to BUDS so you kinda make the decision to do something and you follow through it um so you know you probably learned a little bit of that um I learned a little bit of that um just gently from written type stuff from having to achieve those long term goals not just an overnight an overnight success .  I don't think my personality changed I think I was the same guy personality wise now. sure sure well I think a big is just my Im pretty light hearted like I I was laughing for 95% of BUDS even when it sucked and that's kinda the same way I've been in life but like keeping a sense of humor with everything your going through everyones in the same situation. We’re all miserable together so theres something funny about that umm I think ve always be just not I it wouldn't sit right with me if I quit um everything I've done I did in life I’ve just whether it’s my own I don’t want to use the word ego cause that's a negative connotation but for myself you know I wanted to make sure I got through this and did it umm did never give up. I would say pride. ya I more pride less less ego I would. cause ego is a bad connotation around here but umm but ya my own self pride and self sense of accomplishment.  ,"lets see so I moved uh when I was ten we moved to Reno southern california and then uh I’d say the biggest one was when I was fifteen it was about 2008 I believe both my parents lost their jobs and we had to move in with uh relatives back down in southern california. so that was probably the craziest thing that happened. ya I was pretty I was pretty fortunate until about then i was about 13 years old or 14 15, I was pretty privileged until I was fifteen years old. well I learned a lot from my parents my parents kinda found work multiple jobs kinda found different ways for us to kinda be able to do the things that our friends were doing like playing baseball going on trips and stuff like that so they kinda sacrificed a lot so we could a have the things that we wanted. and then uh it was for my siblings it was a little harder them to see but for me i kinda saw what they were doing behind the scenes, stuff like that um, so ya I’d definitely say a little I got most of kinda that everything that you do is bigger than you I got that from my parents. and they never made an excuse they never complained they kinda just uhh they kinda just worked and worked multiple jobs and didn’t sleep and didn’t eat just for us and that was really inspiring and that kinda continued kinda still like today kinda the same way bt.  I guess I’m more kind of a quiet and I kinda just want to I’m also competitive and definitely through buds it's kinda it’s kinda the thing where uh you are always you don’t you wanna do better than the guy next to you like especially with a lot of like the guys here like some of the guys i’ve gone straight through with it’s kinda like that you know I’m not gonna let you make if I’m not gonna make it we started kinda attitude and you kinda started developing that in boot camp, the same guys I hung out with in boot camp are the same guys I hang out with now and it’s funny how that worked out.   cause theres a bunch of little clicks when you first get there and you kinda see um  you know those same people and clicks and I don’t know how that. oh ya. ya loyalty it’s definitely a loyalty for me. ","uhhh. not like really like comes to mind I guess, I don’t know um. the uh Naval Academy so. yes. yea probably, just like adjusting to it and I think ya so that probably shaped me I guess. to here. Uh ya I think it like prepared me so I was on the hockey team, I think that team aspect kind of like. helped. I think so as BUD/S went on umm. yes ya I think so the like put in the like leadership position kind of was not the first time but like sort of um kind of like beginning to take more people that I I um I don’t know. sorry. ",umm I did a kairos retreat in highschool.  um it’s like I’m not like super religious but that was kinda like a cool experience. turned to like strengthening relationships with family. my dad especially um and then honestly I think uh. No he wasn’t but it was kinda like a a like we wrote letters and stuff. like him and I always sort of had a strange relationship but that kinda brought us together a little but. and then uh going to Navy I think for me uh I needed discipline in my life at the time and uh I think it was uh really good for me and then getting into trouble at the Naval Academy like a lot uh it was uh kinda took me from not not not so good pat and turned me around. kinda forced me to look myself in the mirror and uh change a lot of things. yes. um I mean I think I took the value of relationships early on and uh. also like I was very familiar what it felt like to fail. so and I think that’s what messes with guys a lot out here you got these all american guys who come out here and theyve never failed before and uh you got someone whose royally messed up and uh they know what it’s like and then I think it helps from a leadership perspective you know give guys second chances and then knowing which guys are worth working with and so I think those kids.  um. um I was trying to recall things but no no I don't remember as much as I should. oh well oh ya I think um i’m a pretty light hearted guy. and having a sense of humor is a huge thing for buds like.  if your able to laugh about your current situation. then it makes it so much better. um so I think that’s huge cause I always found myself doing that and you know when your running to hit the surf and that’s the last thing you want to do it’ll be like what the hells going on right now. something like that something I thought that was something I enjoyed so ya. ya I think extroversion was huge to I think uh like as an officer like that was good cause like being extroverted like your not always gonna be uh you can’t really be introverted and I don’t think and have it work like to a certain extent you can but uh. going in and having that extroversion like uh reaching out and uh being able to talk to guys was huge and then uh I found like uh guys who were drawn like to  certain people like who responded well to that. I mean most most of these guys are extroverted. but there;s maybe like five guys that i would consider introverts out of our class of like sixty so uh. extroverts are all attracted to each other.  ,"Uh, I’d say like being baptized. For sure. um, I was pretty young, probably 14. No, this is christain, nondenominational. baptism. um. No, I decided one day. ya. (unsure on subject, hard to make out). Crucible or life shaping experience. Well BUD/s is pretty cool. ok. I did. Ya I’d say that that helped. Shaped, shape me a little bit, yes. It was difficult at first, it kinda you know gives you, helps you figure out time management, stuff like that. so that, would that help shape a lot of things.. I’d say, so the first semester I show up to college I had no idea whats going on, I’m like oh this is not for me, this is just. chaotic, and then it got, then you’d figure it out, you’d figure out a schedule and then you’re fine and then the next semester its like oh hey I’m freakin out again cause I don’t know all the time management stuff. but the second time you know you’re gonna figure it out cause you already did it once so and then every semester from then on is just easier and easier and easier. so, I don’t know, you have a word for it but I don’t think I do.. ya you start to build confidence. and your abilities to deal with things. So um ya, that that directly translates over into BUD/s because you show up to BUD/s and you’re just bombarded. but you know that you’ll fiii, iii its like being at BUD/s is gonna stay hard but it will get easier cause you’ll understand you’ll ya know what I mean?. ya I mean you your either going to or your not and. going through those experiences. now you know that what I’m capable so its kinda just a choice.... umm, (short pause) well I have, I I. I I have a pretty good sense of humor. and that is, that was. I mean I I I have most of the time just ya know kind of keeping myself entertained. sooo I don’t know, they they hate it but. its its how I deal with things. um (short pause) um like pretty. right. ok. Usually they can’t anticipate what I’m gonna do but I mean I’m fairly confident. um so that’s huge. and if you you believe in yourself but I’m also not like cocky because I had no idea, you know this is like a 50 50 in a way. for for me its its like oh we’ll see, hopefully I make it, you know so. I don’t how to put in any other traits (What I think he said, words hard to understand). extroversion. ya I’d say so. ya. yes. I guess I do sometimes. ","It absolutely had…I had…I felt like I had the mental, baseballs all mental, its physical but mostly a game of nowadays what kind of mentality you have. And I feel like…you know…you have three, if you hit three (intelligible) you’re a hall of famer, so failure is part of the game. So I feel like that helped me…constantly…constantly learning how to fail, and accepting failure, and always trying to succeed and learning how to succeed as well shaped me well to come to BUDS. Very, very high energetic. Um sometimes emotional roller coaster but for the most part very positive um love. I have too much energy. Um for staying positive like always finding humor. In uh the worst situations possible in Hell Week, getting gassed on the island in third phase just always, you know, having that high energy to motivate the guys around me","My dad was homeschooled all the way up until sophomore year of high school, and I went to high school for three years, graduated and I went to college for two years. I knew when I was in high school that I wanted to come to this. But my cross country coach at the time, I was very close with and who was kind of like a mentor to me. I wanted to kind of find out more about this training and about the demographic of guys who do well. So he contacted one of the NSW Scouts and found out that typically the guys who succeed are like in their young 20s. High schoolers don't normally do so hot. So. So he suggested to me, you know, maybe hold off, don't enlist right out of high school, maybe get a couple of years of life experience or not. Get a little stronger, a little more mentally, more resilient. So I took that advice on board and did a couple of years of community college just to stay busy. And then over those summers, I would go and kind of do something out of my comfort zone. So one summer, I went and worked at the summer camp in Yosemite. So going into that, I didn't know anyone there, had never been to that part of California before, but thought it would be a fun experience. And I thought it kind of pushed me to be better at adapting to new environments. I think it was effective. I think, I think, I changed a bit, most people do those couple years after high school. And I think that I think that I did better as a result. I don't know for sure what would've happened if I want to come here as 19 year old, but I'm glad that I made that-. Yeah. Yeah. And then just learning independence and making my own decisions, being away from home. Personality meaning…?. Right. I think I'm definitely introverted. So... You know, sometimes it's a bit of a grind being around all these dudes, especially, you know, things like on the island were together all the time. There's no getting away from them. But but I tend to also be pretty agreeable. I don't get angry very easily. And maybe as a result of growing up with so many siblings, pretty patient. Yes. And you can kind of take things in stride. So I don't think I really have any enemies in the class… I haven't gone off on too many people-. Right. I like to be calm and get along with others as much as possible.","Uh, not really. I mean, we tried to try to join the Navy when I was 18 to come here, and my eyesight was too poor, so I moved out of the house. It seemed like the right time. Stars aligned at that point. So when I was 18 and kept pursuing this goal, after I got LASIK eye surgery. I got the surgery immediately after I was disqualified for the program. And then I moved to Texas two months after that. And after that it took about two years to get contracted out. I worked with a friend who moved down there, started his own company. So he started going door to door sales with him. Moved to corporate security after that.  Life changing? Not particularly.  Oh, yes. I went to college for about a year and a half. And, uh, just I knew I was going to come here. My mom encouraged college because she wanted me to get my degree before I- if I ended up doing this why not make it college prior to this? I couldn't study, I was just burnt out from it. I wasn't having a good time or it didn't some fun and exciting. And I didn't really have a major that I just committed to. So I just decided I'm just going to enlist now... do that later. ...Uh, not one of the higher physical performances in the class, but boys, uh... Find out. Always had a personality that I feel like is just trying to help out. Trying to kind of help the team. I always had a teammate attitude. So I think that helps as well as just being a decent person to everyone, regardless of who they are, how they treat you. So I feel like that has developed me through that's definitely helped develop me through this pipeline and essentially just kind of building that team work. When I was in high school, I had a lot of friends that joined the Marine Corps. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life, yet. The military was always kind of in the back of my head. And when they all started going to the Marine Corps, I uh, that was initially the plan. I was- Marines were always like the superhero. Like, ""Those guys were the toughest dudes and studs. Started working out with them. Uh, did some of their PTs with their leaders and stuff. I started, uh, training in my own time getting into shape. But that's kind of a phyical low, but I got into shape and I started becoming one of the fastest runners. They didn't feel like I was being challenged. So I wanted to try something more wishful- Marine recon. And uh, I was pursuing that for a while. And our friend in my hometown said, ""Oh, I'm saying for the SEALs"". I mean there was this old retired SEAL guy that trains, and ""you should meet him."" And I met him, and this kind of attitude and outlook on life, and how humble he was made me switch. The job isn't that much different, but I really like the way this guy acts, I want to be that guy. Yes. He was actually from the start of the company down in Texas. I moved down there and kind of always... Focused... like he was my boss, but he also had that unique understanding of what he would focus on this. 


","I'm proud of BUD/S yes, so I was in college and pursuing my degree earned myself a night in jail on a DUI. So that was kind of a big turning point in my life. I would say the biggest thing that happened to me, because that's when I really turned my sights from school to focusing on this actually into being suspended for a semester of college my third year because of that. And then from there, I decided to continue my education and go on to start training for this assessment. I left I didn't earn my degree. And I didn't did not finish. Yes. So I left and started training for this. And a year later, I joined the military. So I think that just knowing that I can overcome hardships are when things were- things was a pretty dark time for me at that time, as well as really disappointing myself and continue to go on. I think that knowing that I can could overcome, you know, like change events such as that going into BUD/S. I knew that whatever they'd throw at me that I can overcome it. I consider myself a pretty amicable person. I can kind of talk with people, connect with people. So that's I think the big thing here with the emphasis on teamwork is, you know, creating good, strong relationships with people around you. So I think that was a big part of it, was being able to kind of integrate with the class full of type A, very hardheaded people. So it worked out really well and it worked. I think I became pretty clear about everyone in class. Yeah I believe so. I think that I can convey my thoughts and emotions to people in a direct manner, but one that, you know, people can respond to. Yes. Absolutely. I grew up playing sports all my life. I've played three sports all through high school and have always had that competitive drive and desire to succeed. Well, absolutely. I mean, I think competition is- there's a difference between healthy competition and one where you want to be... raise your personal station and be detrimental to others. But I think competitiveness and good drive will to succeed is very important. However, having that competitiveness, you also want the people around you to succeed with you. I think that's kind of the essence of teamwork and something that's very important here. 
","I was considered successful. I won national championships and state championships I think that to me was life changing and I was on some great teams as well. I played football and lacrosse in college. Um, I think I was able to draw a lot from a lot of drills from lacross in college and in football in college. And uh, previous experience or draw from like if I made some mistakes, I could just think back to lacrosse ok this is what we did in this situation. This is how it should be. I think it could be very helpful. Sure. Like something that we used to say in lacrosse was like one more. So that can stem from anything from being one more rep in the weight to one more rep in practice to just focus on the next game and I used that in Hell Week all the time to be like hey I'm just going to do one more push up or. Yeah. I think uh I can take a lot. And uh adapt and will to change and my ego is not too big going to get in the way of anyone. I think that was really helpful. And I think ultimately I got to be able to laugh in the face of adversity or pain and just use humor all the time. I'm an outgoing, caring person. And a leader. And you can kind of you don't think about selfishly about yourself but you can also think of others. And I think you can just take a little bit more.","I'm pretty normal. Uh, philosophy and political science. Um, I love to learn. Um just, being inquisitive, and figure out a purpose mindwise in relation to helping others, and um, yeah those two things together I think make it, um, an easier experience.","No, no nothing too crazy. Um, I don't really know. It, um, if you asked anybody here, they would say I'm pretty quiet. Um, Don't talk a whole lot. I think, um. I think it’s. I've always been pretty like, kind of like an introvert. But, um, I’d say it's. Since I’ve gotten here, I've gotten a little bit more, quieter.","I don't, I don't I don't think so. Uh, Yeah. I mean, I mean, I grew up playing sports. Uh I think I know that this is what I want to do and I prepared for it very well. I was very well prepared. Uh yes, so I'm very I think the various eyes I have a really good sense of humor um...I have a very close knit group of friends and we've also made it all the way through with me. So I think that helps a lot...About uh preparation and training and all that stuff so I think that probably carried over well.","No, not really. Pretty normal. I don’t know. Um, so for me personally, I don't really take things too seriously. I think, just, having fun, helped me get through this. Um, I mean, I know some people are pretty, pretty serious when it comes to doing this. But I just couldn't be serious about it. Had to have fun. Joke around.","Umm definitely really umm persistent I’d say. Umm in high school umm I got like a 4.23 GPA being like a high umm doing like tough stuff if that makes sense uhh. Like uhh I’m also really timid uhh I like really quiet, uhh I like I love the saying “being a quiet professional” like uhh not talking to anyone umm like knowing what I’m doing and doing something really meaningful and big.","Life changing events? For me there was nothing like crazy, nothing crazy I was just when I was in college I was doing fine umm but I was just kinda bored with what I was doing, you know? It just wasn’t really for me, obviously I had finished my degree, you know my parents had saved all that money so I didn’t want to waste all that and not get my degree but ever since I stopped playing sports I just didn’t have anything to kind of go after and chase, nothing that excited me. Schoolwise I just didn’t see myself getting a normal job after college umm I’ve always liked things that are challenging and adventurous so that’s kinda why I came here but as far as life changing events there wasn’t any single event that was big for me. Umm, personality I’ve always been a pretty outgoing guy, always had a lot of friends growing up, like I said I loved to play sports, pretty adventurous, like studied abroad in college in the Czech Republic so yeah I would just say I’m a very curious guy, I like to learn new things, very goal driven, goal oriented, I like to have something to go after. Umm pretty motivated person, umm what else, yeah I mean my family and friends are very important to me, what else, yeah that’s about it.","Um just in in general or?. A little bit of college. Um . Yea uh I had I had a friend of mine die um during a swim practice um drowned uh that I don’t know that that messed me up for like a few days um but I had like a lot of close friends and family kinda reach out um . Yea yup um . Uh and I think that kinda just um after that I became a EMT um I kinda just I never wanted to be like in a position where I didn’t really know what to do. So yea kinda just sought out every means of um I guess just being able to have the skillset to help in any situation . Yes. I just feel for the family more than anything. Like kinda just like looking out for the other guys um makes things easier um just when you’re kinda not focused on yourself, you don’t really think about like how much pain you’re in um I think that’s something that will be (unintelligible) cause me and my friend uh pulled him out of the pool and uh like after that I spent a lot of time um like checking in on my friends like checking in on the family uh and all that and it kinda looking uh looking at like other people’s pain and like trying to help with that it takes away from your pain you’re feeling so that helped a lot. I don’t know I guess I’m not like I’m not crazy outgoing um but I’m not crazy introverted uh...I’m not really sure. I-I’d like to think so um I don’t know, I just had a good sense of humor about the stuff we’re going through here and I try not to take all of it too seriously. Um I think that helped.","I would say I mean, since I've had to move around a lot, I mean, I've gotten pretty good at making friends really easily. Cause I leave them and then I make new ones. But I'm pretty social for the most part. But I'm really quiet sometimes. I get some pretty energetic in the mornings, a lot of guys get annoyed by that. A little bit. I mean, I was definitely like not a troublemaker. Definitely not a troublemaker. I just kinda like kinda do my own thing. Like free spirit.","Not really I lived a fairly normal life in the suburbs, went to public school and then went to college. Uh my family always … sports … we were always pushed if you’re going to do something do it right. My dad was an engineer went to MIT, my older brother does very very good in school and is an investment banker now. We were always told to go for absolutely everything if we were going to do something. That was big in our house, out in the backyard we were very very active as kids and the way my dad pushed us we did very well in school but I just wanted to take a different path and be a part of something greater. Um I don’t know I really like being active I like being on my feet and doing something physically challenging that’s what gives me the most satisfaction and doing it and like being a part of something greater, doing it as part of a team and … doing drills or whatnot and doing them right. It’s really cool to be a part of a community that is constantly trying to make you better. … I don’t know there’s not anything to complain … especially when you get to this point now (unintelligible).","Uh senior year football, I got a hernia the first game of the season and had to get surgery the next day and couldn’t play football the rest of the senior year season. Very traumatic for me I thought I had worked all high school and senior year was kinda over right there. Uh ya so I kinda correlated it a lot its just another one thing that happened its like might as well push on with it. Uh I will definitely say a lot of these guys who are older and out of college are a lot more mature than me and they have taught me a lot. Um and I talk a lot jump around a lot but they would help me move down to uh more their level … I’m just like young, smart, a lot of energy. I would say I’m more lighthearted I take some things seriously you know. I think that does help because there has to be someone in the class who keeps the morale up and then there has to be someone who gets them where they need to go.","Um definitely my dad passing away. Kind of but not really … so he ended up being diagnosed with cancer, fought it, won it. Healed and then took a huge blow and it just went downhill fast. So I actually was in college, quite college and came back to try to help out with that and then after went back to college. Uh I just … anytime that it got hard you just think back on those moments because that was the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. Because you think about your dad he’s your mentor … your huge dad he’s like 6’1” 240 lbs just solid muscle, worked construction. Have him every weekend and every week during the summer. That man who can lift cinder blocks for days and then he can’t even get out of the tub. Just helping him drive places and helping him get in and out of bed that just took more of a toll than anything so anytime it got tough out here just thinking that if I was in pain how was he doing what he went through. I mean the hard working aspect … I think the stubborness is number one honestly that whole factor of when people tell you to quit or don’t think you can do something the stubborn factor just outweighs everything because now I definitely will just because you don’t think I can. … Uh definitely humor you know I would say that’s a huge part of it … having a good laugh whenever shit hits the fan because they try to get you down all the time so just whenever you would find a way or find people to make one thing funny to aleviate that stress or pain that’s happening so yeah I think that’s huge that stubborness or finding humor in things.","Ummm, not really. I did. Yeah, I went to college for two years. I guess that's kind of it was kind of this. I just was in college and I was wanting to come to this and kind of told them I was leaving college so I had to finish, which I kind of like, knew what I wanted to do. And I was pretty, you know, like I was pretty set on it. So they weren't they were happy with my decision. Obviously, my dad definitely took it well. My mom at first was like, ""you're not gonna finish college?"", but she was good with it. And then I just left college and came here. Yeah, I enjoyed college. It was just kind of like I was kind of looking to see what I wanted to do. And nothing really stuck out to me besides this. And I'd like- so something I like thought about growing up, but it was never like, I'm going to go do that until I got to college and kind of started switching majors a few times. And I was like, ""you know what, honestly, I want to do this."" I don't want to be in college. Yeah.","Mmm no not really um pretty normal life, nothing crazy happened
Ok um can you give me an overview of high school, college
Um yea um so grew up in North Carolina just stayed there my entire life, born and raised in the Outer Banks um went to elementary school, middle school uh was kind of trouble kid I guess um 
You were a trouble kid? I was 
Ok
Uh teachers called my mom alot uh played baseball um 
What did you get in trouble for?
Just like uh like talking in class or like just like horse playing really just like messing around with my friends when I shouldn’t have been messing around with my friends um 
Were you in like juvenile detention?
No no no no nothing like that nothing like that just uh like phone calls home Hunter was talking in class alot, asked him to stop, he wouldn’t stop like stuff like that
Testing boundaries
Exactly 
Yea 
Um and then in high school uh just skateboarded alot and then um played baseball till like my junior year and then quit playing um went to college and then stopped going to college after like 2 years and came here
","Prior to BUD/S….um...aside from just having kind of like the one off relative pass away, which was a grandparent, no, I haven't had anything that, that has been kind of life changing. I would say. Oh, yeah, it was hard. Yeah, I grew up with them, um... Grandfather, yeah...uh but no, nothing really was that life changing. Natural causes yeah. Yeah exactly yup Um....as far as the life events, no, I don't think so. Yep. I went to high school and then played football in college,um...played local here. I would say that was probably more just kind of being a lifelong athlete was more, I think, kind of the hinge point for, for coming to BUD/S and, and doing well here. At the University of San Diego. It would be D1AA.. Defensive end. Um… As far as character traits and… Um...I would say I'm probably a little more introverted. As far as like being outspoken and being kind of like a leader. I’m sort of just like hitting the follow button for BUD/S and...and being coachable.  Just kinda...do what I’m told...you know pass test gates. Um...yeah. Really not trying to do anything like really out of line or anything like that. Sort of...follow the natural progression. Phase to phase.  I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I think, I think my friends would say so too. Definitely not the jokester. But, but the sense of humor is huge here. Yeah. You definitely need that.","Uhm, I don’t know.  I wouldn’t say I had any like major events that were super life changing it was more of uh just kind of a gradual shift in who I developed to be. Uh, I think, helped me just like more of a serious guy, uhm kept things professional when I need to, but I was just kinda able to keep some perspective and laugh about things at times. It kinda worked as a balance for me. ","My parents are really strict, and just the people I met growing up. One of them was uh one of my mentors was a retired senior chief and the stories he told me about the teams and everything else he’s done definitely attracted me to the teams. No actually I just met him by coincidence, and then talked from there and then talking to him I read pretty much every book I could find about the teams and went from there. I’d say just the biggest thing is probably just not quitting all this just finish whatever I start, I’d say that’s the biggest thing that just kept me going and then always with the attitude of uh expecting the worst case scenario and then not really caring too much about it. ","I went to a very small all boys school. I graduated with 57 boys. So it was a very BUD/S environment where you were just with the same people. And that sort of community was very important to me, espeically playing sports within that community, which is a smaller subset. So I felt I needed to find that same community, which is a smaller subset. So in college, I really focused on coming to BUD/S. And making this my career. I went to Yale. I think most people would tell you I'm a very quiet person. I've never been comfortable like in the spotlight, but I think that's helped me where I'm used to being in my own head to some degree. Like, uh that part of BUD/S like the self-taught aspect was never really a problem. That never really needed to find out with other people to express their frustration or stress or anything else. ","My dad died when I was nine, and my older brother's dad died when they were six and three. Then my little sister's dead Mom when they were younger too. My older brothers' Dad died when they were six and three. So long before I was born. And my little sisters mom when they were younger too. I think it was when they were nine and then I guess nine, seven, and five. No they are step sisters, my little ones, my brothers. I only have two full siblings. Yeah, I'm the only one who was in the house with every single sibling. I guess most people would probably say when my Dad died. But I'd probably say when I was in high school I got in trouble, my sophomore year and my mom grounded me and locked me in my room when I got off school. So I'd get off school and lock was on the outside of the door. She'd put trays of food like I was a prisoner. And I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone in the family and I wasn't allowed to play sports or workout. This lasted for a month. She took the TV, so I started listening to the radio and she took the radio out of the room too. She took all the books out, so I just did my homework and would stare at the wall until I fell asleep. I egged two cars. You decide what matters. I don't know, I mean, I gues people telling me I'm not going to do it. Pretty easy for me to focus. I knew I was going to make it, so I didn't really have a response. ","My Dad and his Dad both went to the Academy and played Football, so that's one hundred percent what led me to the Academy. And especially this was after I got cut from the football team my freshman year. I went to the Sprint Football team, that influence, is why I'm here. So I never, definitely, never seriously thought about this really until after getting to the Academy. When I was younger, in first and second grade, I was a little troublemaker and my Grandma, I just remember this talk, I did something stupid, and she kinda put me in my place. Getting cut, that was a goal I had set for myself from as old as I could even understand what my Dad and Grandpa did. That was a very long way lifetime goal. And I was just completely lost, I don't feel like I have the right words for it, but just completely lost. Felt like no purpose, so I had a couple guys that I played ball with at prep school that went straight to Sprint from there. Then I had a new purpose, and I started to look at why did I actually come here? This goal didn't happen. How might I respond? And then, the theme with that talk with my grandma and whatnot, the theme of like a restart, those two specific events, they happened, and then, a new me when I was younger, and then when I was older, over plebe year. 
I think I'm pretty disciplined. I talked about those couple goals. Goals set early on. Just discipline and working hard and figuring out what I need to do and then just continuing to do that. I think that's been the best. I read the Jocko book, discipline equals freedom. There's a lot of stuff that I connected to myself where motivation. There's a lot of times, obviously, for sure in this pipeline, where motivation was not there, but discipline to just keep with it. ","My mom, not my Dad, forced me to be my own man. My mom was a single mom working one job. My grandma also took care of me. Not relying on anybody to get it done.
Aggressive, straightforward, no bullshit. ","I actually think about this a lot. I though my preschool was really cool. It was at a young age I know the younger you are the more critical development is, and everything at my preschool was a place where I thought creatively and imagination is really rewarded and encouraged and I think that kind of really shaped a lot of what, how I approached, education and pursuits and whatnot, I give a lot of credit to that. Then sports were huge in my life, Pop warren football, I was in eighth grade. That was the first time I felt that coaches expected responsibility and maturity from us. And this idea of really navigating adversity. One of the things they did there was whenever I couldn't make it to practice my mom would call the coach and they said, ""hey, no more of that if you aren't going to be at practice call you call us yourself. I don't want to be hearing from your parents."" To me that was something that clicked, I was like alright, time to start taking responsibility for myself, accountability. I went to an all boys school, a private Catholic school that was big for me too. I ran track there. Kind of a lot was expected of you and I were given a lot of rope to hang yourself, but a lot was expected of you and I ran track. It was a good track school. I was given a chance to be really surrounded by guys who are willing to do the extra stuff, extra work to become champions, winners. That's kind of where I get my competitive nature and my willingness to win. And this kind of the idea of brotherhood. I really didn't become a good friend in general until I was a junior and I remember it clicking one day, I got to be a better friend. And as soon as that happened, being a much better friend to people. 
I think I was just driving one day or something and I'm like, you know what, I really was thinking like who my best friend was like, I got to be a better friend to him. It wasn't necessarily an event that happened, it was the realization. Like, I really want better friends in life  and want my friends to have my back, and I realized I got to be that guy in order to have those friends.
My high school was awesome. It really gave me this idea of a lot of things I experience in this pipeline. My experience in high school and on the track team just being surrounded by guys who, complaining was not, they just take whatever you have, just suffer on your plate and make the best of it and you don't make excuses. Track was as much more of a team sport in high school than I think it typically is just because you were just about winning two events. And then I went on to lifeguarding. Lifeguarding was huge too. Summer after my junior high school, I became a lifeguard and embracing the suck was big there. You're a rookie, you're treated pretty poorly. People warned me it's going to be the best job, but your first summer it's going to really suck, but it's going to be worth it. As a rookie, you did everything. I remember after my first day working just being exhausted after my first day. You did everything you're thrown into, drinking from a firehose. Same thing I experienced a lot in this pipeline. You're always uncomfortable, you get cold a lot. As a rookie I never put on sweats on because I knew I was going to be there first one to go on rescue. So I'd never sweats because I didn't want to take too long to go on the rescue. You get hazed a lot. My lifeguard stand had the three o'clock block from three to four, they would just mess with me for an hour. That was like an established thing every day. Again, it's a responsibility. I remember going to those workouts, like track workouts that's one thing, if you lose a workout, if you don't do your best, you're going to lose the race, and having this feeling, this weight, if I don't do my best on this lifeguard workout, it could lead to me losing a rescue, it could be me causing someone to die. So I felt a lot of magnitude there, I felt a lot of importance in what I was doing. Main takeaways was that idea of responsibility was even furthered beside of that job. That idea of embracing the suck and dealing with it rather than finding ways to deal with it internally rather than just trying to get out of the situation.
Gratitude. I think gratitude is the biggest one learning just to be grateful. I mean, whatever is going on, you're going through the worst evolution ever. You feel like you always have something to be grateful for, so if you're grateful for something it makes you feel better about being in whatever situation you're in and if you're gateful for something, you want to protect it. So I think gratitude is huge for me, and just doing BUD/S in San Diego you have a lot to be grateful for, and just owning whatever your mistakes are, not refusing to, it's like a nice, easy way to get out of it. It's like a dopamine rush getting out of something getting out of maybe not blaming yourself, I realize is much better, healthier to take responsibility of your mistakes. Empathy is big. I always want, I've been described to people as empathetic. And I think that is huge here because you got to be thinking about the people next to you. Gets you through it, doing something for someone else rather than for yourself is always, I think, I can motivate myself to do that more easily. 
And humor. Just being able to laugh in a situation, being able to laugh at yourself. That's actually one of my favorite qualities in other people being able to laugh at yourself. And I don't quite know why that works, but I see the guys I'm surrounded by and what's helped me get through is I think the ability to laugh at myself. All I know is it's the people I'm most drawn to in the community are that are able to laugh at themselves. 



",
"so my family is a really big Navy family. My dad also went to the academy my uncle did too. um and then two of my uncles three of my uncles were SEALs and one of my cousins so that kinda like uhh. three uncles and one cousin but their real old so. Yes. So I was born in Bethesda maryland umm lived there for like fiveish something and then we moved to jacksonville Florida for three years and then moved back to the North Island for a few years and then we’ve been in Charleston South Carolina for fifteen sixteen years so we’ve definitely moved around um my dad was kinda he was a Navy doc so he was chasing different residencies and um like uh practices you could be. i I had a lot of that I mean as an only child my mom was  pretty um oh babying of me like coddling a little bit but my dad was just is from one of seven or something so there’s no holdbacks. ya so he was a big fan of the belt to when it was real bad and my mom would do the soap in mouth thing. nothing extreme just like grounding or taking away the playstation or whatever. I ran cross country in highschool I played lacrosse as well and then I did club lacrosse on the outside and i was on like a swim team when I was in middle school but that’s preteen I guess. No I did not, I rowed for the first year, light weight crew and then did not really I mean Patrick did that and stopped doing that after plebe year. I love music umm I’m not I used to play the drums umm I got reasonably good at that and then I went to the academy I couldn’t obviously bring a drum set up there and then during TAD time I picked guitar. oh no. oh we did a bunch of traveling just like a bunch of vacations. Personal ya but some of my buddies went to peru iceland um italy Germany LREC from the academy. um and sometimes I get into kinda like weird waves of um like I’ll be very frugal for a while and then whatever I’l like treat myself kinda thing  but I see myself as of saving up for like certain things like for all those trips I would save up for awhile and kinda like oh stay away you know even the odds for a little while. I do not. uh not none on the record.
","so when I was 12 years old I wanted to wrestle a tournament down in Virginia Beach and uh just to watch and there was some SEALs there I didn’t really know a whole lot about it, I talked to them and I did the whole pull up thing but I was just a little kid and they told me if I wanted to do it I should do it . and I uh started reading about it you know watching movies watching you know just hearing from other people like my friend was a SEAL or my cousin was a SEAL my buddy went to BUDs and I’d talk to them, my neighbor was a retired master chief SEAL so . yes from my home town a super super super small town . right . my parents were super free range parenting and they basically let us do anything we wanted until we lost their trust or did something to retract their free range style . no not really no I've been getting grounded or couldn't go to a friend’s house or stay the night at a buddies or something. right right not a whole lot of spankings for my siblings um ya . ya . Um, all my friends were into like we would ride bikes and BMX and stuff. I’d always try to have you know like be better than them at that and they'd be better than me at this thing and I’d try to work hard and be better than tham at that, but ride BMX we’d snowboard. just a D3 school . I did it for two years and I ended up not going back for the team. ya so I wrestled 184 was the weight class I was losing like 10 pounds a week which is pretty average for that level um my coach he’s kinda an old school style he would uh he would set like perimeters for us and we’d be different than the entire school we’d had curfews like our off season like over the summer he’d be really strict on drinking. college. ya very strict very old school mentality he was like 75 76 years old . um basically I got tired of it um he was kinda nagging me when I’d go to a party or something like out of season and I was 21 like two years ago and why are you going to parties and I don’t know. You know it was kinda my fault I was kinda a dummy I don’t know . right, you know uh . very controlling and very micromanaging and I said you know I’m not gonna do this anymore it’s not for me. I’m gonna focus on going to Buds so that’s what I originally wanted to do to begin with . yes . I really like to go out and hike like get a couple buddies together and go out to the Shenandoah mountains just relax go shoot go hike, camp stuff like that. take my friends jeep off road, kinda like fun things to do . at some things I’d like to think a lot of things through but if someone is like do you want to go do this right now I’m like ya sure you know what I mean or you wanna liek can you go help me with this or can you go do this for me like ya or I would pretty much I wouldn;t think it through . spontaneous, ya maybe not impulsive but . yes i have four . uh the one on my right side was . um it was four of my friends we were just together, goofing around and talking about like east coast versus west coast mentality we had a couple buddies from the west coast who were the surfer kinda guys and we were all like kinda I wouldn’t say like just like back wood you know I mean like kinda not redneck but country type of style you know we were snooping around in the woods so we got an east coast tattoo on our right butt cheek so that was kinda spontaneous  . I have like minor one, I got one in Virginia Beach 3 or 4 years ago in a neighborhood it wasn’t like anything it was just like 35 in a 25 or a 30 or something like that . no no","mm ya sure so I I kinda bounced around growing up I lived in a bunch of places umm I born in arizona then moved to new jersey then salt lake city Utah umm. I was not but my dads job moved around quite a bit. so we moved around quite a bit and then umm one of our the one place that was consistent was coronado, we have a summer house here, still do. So I’ve been coming to Coronado since I was you know one years old two years old whatever it was so even though like this has always felt like home to me. I learned about the teams early when I was young umm it was something I always wanted to do but I never really pulled the trigger on it you know obviously I enlisted in the navy at 29, 28. so it took me awhile to get here. umm but. ya id say so and then I went to college got out of college and started working some desk jobs uhh and just felt overall unsatisfied with what I was doing and Id find everyday I'd be on youtube finding videos on seal teams learning everything I could about the teams so one day I said screw it why am I wasting all this time watching videos why dont why don't I uhh actually follow through with my dreams so kinda quit everything and ran off to join the circus. ya. ya that's a good question my parents were strict they weren't like beat me strict it wasn't like I was getting the belt or anything like that but. uhh no. no maybe like no maybe like once in my life they were they were gentle gentler gentler punishers I guess but they were definitely more on the strict side. curfews no obviously no drinking like that growing up. they were very good parents you know I’d had to have good grades in school get into a good college do all that. ya. ya I I think any sports team that is a team sport has a tight knit community. I played basketball uhh in high school. I played volleyball as well which in California is kinda law I went to school in arizona. and I ended up playing college volleyball at USC in Los Angeles. yep for volleyball. ya that was D1 we were number one in the nation for two years. I never played I was a walkon. so that probably helped a lot too actually looking at it now just cause I had to be the one first one in the gym last one to leave just to prove that I belonged on that team. cause there was much better talent that they had on the team so the one thing I could really offer was hard work and a good attitude about it.  ","So i played sports my whole like, I played basketball in college, uh. it was a division two university. uh always had you know that want to compete and I’ve always been passionate about serving my country. and uh obviously the SEAL community is kinda that tier one community that you want to be apart in the military and it’s something that that I just wanted to be apart of. ok. ya spanking. spanking, it was definitely more of tough love. learn quickly how to not get caught doing things. ah this is wooden spoon ya the wooden spoon. uh ya they used to mouth I never got it but they definitely did get soap in the mouth. yes ya I would consider myself impulsive definitely. the fact that I enlisted in the military was a very impulsive decision. ya it was something I had always been planning on doing buyt. the decision definitely wasn’t calculated, it was just one day I walked into the office and enlisted. no. no speeding tickets. yes. uhhhhh lets see so uh I had been offered scholarships to go play basketball and uh I guess the day that I signed to go to the school that I went to I kinda just sick of waiting around and I just wanted to sign so I just signed, I wanted to stay in california it wasn’t necessarily as good of a school it wasn’t a division one school that I wanted but I just made the decision to sign and not wait to try and get something better so that was kinda an impulsive decision.. ","so ya, my dad was, he went to the Naval Academy to. so that was probably like my original interest in the Navy. I guess and then Captain Duncan Smith, he is like a family friend and he was in the teams. and he was kinda the reason I wanted to go down this path. um and just and his one of his sons is also in the teams and like I spent like a lot of time at their house over the summer and that kinda just like seeing the way he was kinda uhh. yes. err no so ok not super, that was probably junior year I think. yes. there were some, my mom was pretty, they were both pretty disciplined with us and. umm, with us like pretty strict so I think that helped um. umm. probably, like a little bit of everything. 79 : I’d say more like just being like grounded sorta thing. um. yes. like hand, belt, soap in mouth. mainly the soap when my mom was mad. no so I lived in Moscow for two years.  and then Huston for two years and then uhh I’ve been in Michigan the rest of the time so I pretty much grew up in Michigan uhh.  the other. uhh From when I was born till about like two years old. and then two to four in Huston. and then Michigan for the rest.  yes, so I played pretty much, my parents got me involved in like every sport so I’d always be doing something. and one of my brothers the closest one would just like be on the team with me even though he wasn’t necessarily old enough so we were always doin something going sport to sport.  staying busy. hockey was like my main. yes. their a club team. yep ya. umm so with the Naval Academy I guess that helped with leadership like team aspect and everything, getting different exposure to different communities and just like seeing where I didn’t want to be and where I’m interested in umm how about that .  is that. yes um so I guess SOAS helped. get exposure to it.  ","I grew up I grew up in the upper middle class probably my dad was a marine so I wanted to be in the military for a long time,. he was enlisted so when I wanted to join the military he pointed me towards the Naval Academy just cause like I don’t think he loved being enlisted and I think he saw the opportunities that an officer had and uh he’s like dude if you’re gonna do it do it right. and then I joined like in my pre-teen years and I like hated the idea and then uh went to highschool and got hit with the travis manion uh story cause he went to my high school and then uh so i wanted to be a marine for a while. yes um so that got me really interested in the Naval Academy and had the opportunity to play lacrosse there and then you play lacrosse at Navy Brendan Looney comes into play big time and so that kinda shifted me towards the uh towards the SEAL teams. ya so my dad like was a marine right so like I had a shaved head I had a buzz cut till I was in 8th grade. um very disciplined I had like certain chores I had to do everyday every weekend and they had to be done right like my dad would go out and inspect the garage after I swept it and if wasn’t good I had to do it again. and I thought he was just being a dick but like I realized he’d always tell me that’d I’d thank him one day and like now I’m looking back I have like some sort of like discipline and I had I’m able to like follow through on things and do things right like the first time and I’m like holy crap he was right but ya uh a belt was a thing my mom was like. ya uh loss of stuff like taking away whatever game system or my cell phone or grounding I was all in um.. ya uh like that so ya it was definitely like very strict my dad was very strict in terms of what I wore what my sister wore like how we wore our hair like if my hair was messy he’d tell me I looked homeless. no so uh he joined the reserves when I was born and then retired at 40 so he was in the reserves when I was young and then uh. So I grew up in Southern Philadelphia and stayed there my whole life from like one town over cause my dad started a new company. yes. uh just pretty much just uh sports. uh multiple different sports teams. uh I I was in a a playing community service group in high school. uh that was pretty cool, battalion service club. so that was pretty cool. football was my other bug one then I wrestled for one year. just staying shape. ya uh traveled a lot especially that my TAD year because I had a like a predump just cause I was like (unintelligible). so I traveled a lot then a Ireland once and then like all over the country visiting guys and then uh that was one trip. but ya I uh did a lot did a lot in the general Annapolis area uh pretty busy went to DC and Baltimore all the time. probably I think uh ya I would say if it’s for a good reason I'm down. I don’t no. ya uh I actually got one right before we headed out I was trapped down in Virginia Beach and my if you're going on the eatern shore side so I was going like 81 in a 45 or something like that.. reckless driving technically so that was part of the deal with during first phase. I I got an attorney to go on my behalf Originally they said no you have to go cause it was a misdemeanor. but I I got an attorney to get me out of the ticket but he got me out of the court. ya I got in some trouble so I put this like the interview so it’s like the interview for destruction of property plebe year, it’s just like breaking stuff uh I paid for it so uh.. ya ya. ya a few of those um not anymore um ya so.. ","No I, I wouldn’t call it a military family, I’ve had people in my family that were in the military but my dad wasn’t in the military, my mom wasn’t in the military, nothing like that. My dad’s kinda more like if it doesn’t bother him he doesn’t want to mess with it you know and so. So I met some SEALS. um and I have just been in contact with people that have SEALs in their family, like I went to college with a guy whose son was a SEAL and this guy was like an A type personality and he’d already had a career, retired. he just was going back, he went to a vocational school first so he was like just trying to learn stuff and like seeing him and talking to him about his son and all that stuff it really opened up it opened up like this other world that I didn’t know existed casue I’m like from a really small town and you pretty much you get a house, you get a wife, you get truck and you get a job and you stay there for the rest of your life and that’s it so talking to him about possibilities and stuff was just huge and then also uh there was some SEALs they were uh doing like training at Fort Knox in Kentucky and they ended up becoming friends with one of my friends fathers and they came and hung out with us a lot on the weekends when they had the weekends off from training and just talking to them, picking their brain and I was like oh, these, these are the guys, the guys I want to hang out with ya.. ya lets do it.. ok. ok, so I was a pretty wild kid um and I got in, I got in a lot of trouble but it wasn’t like legit trouble it was just, I was always just doing stuff. you know, I was pretty hyper so I don’t know, I’d like to give a status quo. like if they are telling me to get in line in school like for no reason then I’m like. ya, in a way. yes in way, not anymore not anymore. No no no, it was, like I said, it wasn’t ever real trouble. it was, I was a good kid. they let me, my parents let me make my mistakes. and so like I’ve been spanked yes um, i’ve been you know smacked whenever I mouth off you know.. on the playground. yes but um I I was never like legitimately grounded or anything um but I I mean I ended up being a good kid, I never had any oh bad intentions or anything. I was never like like juvenile like nothing like that. that’s next level, I never got into like drugs or anything like that. I just, whenever I was younger just I was just hyper. um we did not, we did not move around, I’ve lived in the same town all my life um I uh played baseball in the summers when I was a kid. and then I got into soccer and soccer was where I really started to like that that clicked with me, like baseball meh. never clicked for me. ya high school. I did like, I went to a, this may be laughable but I went to a crossfit gym for awhile and the community there was outstanding, just awesome, super competitive great um I did tae kwondo for twelve years so I was around all that but that more the individual type you know. ya. yes I uh so I worked in a machine shop throughout. that entire time I was going to college, I did like two years at a sort of vocational college. I have two associates degrees, one in precision machining, one in advanced CNC machining and then from there I went and got my bachelors from purdue in industrial technology. and um throughout all that I was working and then I was, after that I was I took like a year to where I was just working and training and that that was pretty much it and then I signed up. I knew that I was gonna, I knew that I was going to but if you don’t have that impulse like some people. um so I think the decision the decision for me to join at that time I I planned on joing at that time a while back but. the decision was kind of impulsive in way too so it was weird. I have one tattoo. I got it when I was eighteen years old. No. uh I have one speeding ticket. No. it was just funny. ","No my parents were high school sweethearts and have been married for 35 years. I actually talk to them everyday…probably the closest family in the United States. Oh it definitely has. I had the best childhood growing up. We did everything as a family. LSU football games on Saturday, church on Sunday morning, watch the Saints and the Cowboys on Sunday afternoon. Yep yeah I grew up in the same house. Lafayette, Louisiana. Yeah so I was playing professional baseball in uh Colombia South America. And got ss...ate some bad food and got really sick and uh had to go to the hospital and ever since then I’ve lost sight and ever since then it was the last time I picked up a baseball. Um and then I just remember coming home from there and I always, I always wanted to become a SEAL. I thought baseball was my purpose, I wanted to go Major Leagues. No jobs, whole nine yards. I remember my dad picked me up from Louis uh International Airport in New Orleans and I said I’m done with baseball, I wanna be a Navy SEAL. That was in um November of 2017. Finishing school. I had um four classes left so it took the next semesters to do that online, and then I started. training for 6 months. And that’s when they shipped me out in February of 2019. Um I’ve always loved training for anything I love having a purpose and a goal, and baseball was just not meeting that, and of course reading the books, and you know, watching the movies, and doing more research, and actually understanding the training, and making that commitment, is the most purpose I have ever, I’ve ever had in my life. Um, you know, grew up in the south yes ma’am no ma’am, got spankings until I was like 10 or 12, you know. Um, aaaa my parents were, uhh I wouldn’t say they were like strict ya know, but as far as they kinda like let me figure out. I went to a private school, catholic school, um in high school, and played football and baseball and um excelled in baseball, not too good at football, really excelled in baseball, um and just you know every Saturday morning before the LSU games my dad would go hit, you know work on my craft, something like that um. Yeah just you know, normal high school athletic life. Yes I went to the University of Arizona. Played baseball there, and then uh…finished my last year at Troy University, which is where I got my degree from. I was taking online classes and giving baseball lessons during that time period. To a certain extent. I mean everyone is impulsive. Oh, no tattoos. Uh I bought a dirt bike *snaps fingers* just like that. Uh, yes I have about 4 to 5 speeding tickets.","No, not really. My uncle was in the Air Force for a little while and my grandfathers were both in the Navy long time ago. But yes, I think since I was a kid, I wanted to go to the military. It's just interesting to me. But I didn't know what I knew I wanted to pursue. I didn't know anything about the SEALs until I was in high school. I watched the movie Lone Survivor. So I was I was very influential to me. I watched it with my best friend at the time. And then after the movie ended, I watched it and I told them I'm going to do that. And he started laughing. He was like, are you crazy? Like everyone in that movie died, like, that was very unpleasant. And uh, But I knew. I knew pretty much since I saw that later, some research I did. I was really drawn to the unity that I saw in the guys that were in that movie, how they were facing an incredibly negative circumstances like, you know, overwhelming force. They all kind of knew what was going to happen. And yet they didn't turn on one another. They didn't go every man for himself, they stayed together. They fought till the end and, I knew I knew I wanted to go to the military. And I knew that I wanted to be part of a brotherhood like that where it didn't matter what was happening. Guys were there for each other. So that was kind of what first turned me on to this program. Then quite a bit of research on my own, and eventually I ended up going for it.. Stepfather. Yeah...and uh that introverted side of me has always, I’ve always longed for a community. I’m Enlisted","It kind of depended. I was someone that had... Physical punishment was ever like... if I really. As a younger child, that was like a standing, but it was never like a... as I got older. It's just like, okay, well, you're not going out with friends. You don't get your phone or... Privaledges were- Stuff that definitely as a kind, sucked, but nothing that was like, crazy. Uh, I moved... My dad, my dad and well, I stayed in the same house. So I, uh, till I came here. The only time I moved schools was when I moved from one city to another. I was about... about 6th grade. So right when I- one moved from when I was in sixth grade from a place 60 miles away, and that was totally fine.
","The family. Family friend- I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia. So it's you know, that's a big half of the community over there. So I'd always kind of seen them walking around and whatnot. And from a young age, you know, knowing who they were, and kinda had an idea of what they did. You know, my parents, you know, when they first told me about, say, ""you know, these guys are the ones that protect us and whatnot."" That's kind of where it started going back my head. But when I was young enough, it sound like such an insurmountable thing. But growing up, we had a couple of family, friends who, you know, I would talk to and the people that they were I wanted to emulate. So from there, it was always kind of thought that, hey, I'm may pursue this. Corporal punishment was a very big part of- spankings and the belt and whatnot. Yes.  Yes, there was definitely a belt. I was probably like 10 I so would probably be the latest that was, you know, as I started to grow older, you know, that they will just treat me like an adult. And when I made mistakes, I was held accountable for those mistakes. So that was, when I got older and teenage years and what not. It was more grounding and kind of restricting my freedoms because I would say they got breached their trust or something. So because of that, my freedom would be restricted. I didn't play any video games, but just grounding. I couldn't go play with my friends. And, you know, yeah the car once I was able to drive is a big thing. No, I was born and raised in, Virginia Beach, the same house. Yes, yes. I played baseball, football. I swam from 9th grade on middle school as well. Yes. Yes. So the school, I went to a first through twelfth grade private school. So it was you know, you were in the same building your entire your entire time in school. So middle school and high school were always more blended than it would be in, you know, typical elementary, middle, high school. Absolutely. I mean, the people that I went to school with, I was pretty much with from first grade on. So, you know, very strong relations there. And so it was beneficial because we all knew each other very well going into when we played the team sports. So that was a good, good relationships built early on. Yes, I did college. And then when I when I left college, I came back home and worked odd jobs. I worked in a restaurant for while. I was a server. I was I was- my summer job was a Virginia Beach lifeguard. So I did that for eight years every summer. That was a big part of a lot of physical training involved in that. And outside of that, you know, worked out a lot and then got on certain programs lifting programs and running programs. Once I had, you know, set my sights directly on my dock to BUD/S, which was about two years ago, I would say it would be a really good turning point defining moment when I started, ""I'm going to train for this."". I have tattoos, I have speeding tickets. Yes. I did like to drive fast from time to time. Say, four years ago, the last time. But impulsive isn't tattoo's or making rash decisions if-. Yes, if it's a big purchase or something, that's going to impact me for a long period time after I make that decision, I typically am pretty thoughtful about that. I'd say that most of the mistakes I made my life were something where this was kinda younger and more than my decision making from that. But if I made a mistake, it was because of an impulse decision and because of that, I think now, as I've grown up, matured a bit, that rash decisions are fewer and further between. And I'm more thoughtful in my decision making and the whether they're negative or positive impacts the decisions have. 

","Uhh and I went to Tufts University. I played college sports there. Yes, I'm an officer. I went to OCS. Two parent household. Yes. Very much so um growing up we were in Massachussetts. I had a great relationship with my parents. I consider my upbringing normal but I think but I think to most people it's not normal. Um she was basically sick until my 13th birthday. The first 13 years of my life. Going through that but yeah, also like it changed the dynamic going through that. Honestly probably but it's hard to say because I I thought it was normal. I thought it was like everyone's life but it wasn't so yes, yes ma'am but I don't know. I had a very normal upbringing in life but I mean life changing could be considered college I went to private high school. I was considered successful. I won national championships and state championships I think that to me was life changing and I was on some great teams as well. Uh I love the team team aspects I love winning. I like the competitiveness and the common goals everyone on that team is working together for a common goal. Things you don't like about it? Um I think it's like anything like if you have uh (intelligible), you learn a lot. You have bad people on the team you need to get rid of them and you have to figure out how to get that team to be successful without being distracted. Um honestly I just knew I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a firefighter in the community until I was like five and this was pre 9/11. I was like yeah this is what I want to do. My dad was a helicopter pilot. Yes, yes. Or no, sorry he was active duty before. I parents were really strict, they ran a tight household. Not as bad as helicopter, but they were just around me. Depending on what you did, you'd have to like write an apology or do pushups or something that. Restriction.Or I'd start to go to bed in my house then go to their house but sometimes it would be like a week or more. Um I was. I was always a part of student council. So I think education, if you want successful you need to be educated. Um once I graduated from college, I took a little time off and I worked. I worked for the Kraft Group. I was doing data analytics. Desk job. No, I knew I wanted to do this. I took that job and I talked to the CO, and said hey, look, I'm going to come to BUDS. I was working out like three times a day I work. I'd workout at lunch. And then I would go in the afternoons and work out again. No. I mean, I'm definitely like I get excited when I make decisions. I say like let's go. Maybe I don't formulate a plan all the time, like beforehand. Like a comprehensive plan. And maybe I like to figure things out on the fly sometimes, but other than that I think big decsions through a good amount.","Two parent household. I'm pretty normal. Suburban upbringing. Uh, bay area, San Clara, so yeah. High school, college, then came here. Uh, Pepperdine. Just help. Help and learn. I think this is the best environment to do that um, in every respect. Learn about the social dynamics of the world, about myself, and then be in a position to help them in a unique environment. It's, yeah. I played water polo and I loved the water, um, and, I think that was just the final choice within direction. When I was 11 probably. Just, I want to serve. Um, fair, strict when needed to be, liberal when needed to be, uh, pleasant. Timouts, spankings, um, conversation. Just depended on circumstance and whether or not I was capable of understanding what I did wrong and whatnot. Same house. Uh, played water polo, swam, um, that's pretty much it for sports. Um, I mean, it's a dynamic environment playing water polo. Uh, you have to think within different situations and you have to be physical, but at the same time know when to like (unintelligible). I mean it's the same with any sport though, it's like finding that balance obviously I think that helps in relation to having to work with others. Um. Uh, slight in between time. Graduated in winter of 2017, went home. Uh, started to run, because I hadn't done that. Been in the water my whole life. And just worked odd jobs, and then enlisted, and came here. Not impulsive.","Uh, divorced parents. I've lived with my dad since I was about nine or ten. Yeah. She’s still around. Uh, but, yeah. But, lived with my dad since I was ten years old. (unintelligible). Yeah, so I went to, uh, high school uh, went to a semester of college. Played football. Uh, didn't like it. And I joined uh, a little over a year ago. Yeah. bootcamp straight here, and prep. Um, I've always been, always been into like sports, athletics, like team stuff. um, And yeah like playing football, baseball, like being a part of teams, you're always looking for really like, that special bond. But you just like, I don't know, playing high school sports you can't really find that because nobody is like this, here. So. Say when I was about a freshman in high school. Felt. yeah, just started reading all the books and stuff, uh, kind of piqued my interest. So. Um, well my dad was pretty hard on, hard on me. Always trying to push me, whether that be sports or academics. Um, but yeah. Kind of build that uh, work ethic that I think I still have. Um. No, no, he never laid a hand on me, uh, but he was definitely, definitely very hard on, on all my, on all of us. No, I lived in Virginia my whole life. Burke Vriginia. Um, I lived in like three houses, since I was… Yeah, so I played, played baseball, football all through high school. Um, I’d say, I mean I was pretty committed to that. I was always really. I mean if I Wasn't, I wasn't playing it I was either working out or, yeah. I mean that was pretty much my whole, that was like my life. Just trying to go to college and play a sport. Um. Yeah, so we were in Virginia for all high school and everything for that. And then following that I went to Shepherd university. Yeah I was playing football. Um, yeah. So kind of, was on the fence about, coming out of high school, if I wanted to go to college or just join the Navy. Um, had some, had some pressure to go play college football. Um, and I thought if I didn't like it I could always just leave. So then, so I was like, go try it out, and didn't like it, yeah. And came home for thanksgiving break and told my dad I was doing this. He was like, alright, I’m not gonna talk you out of it. And yeah. Went to my recruiter in the fall, and it’s been smooth sailing since. Um, no. No. I’ve never been pulled over. No tattoos. Not yet. I don't think, I don’t think I will. Um. No. um, no I'm actually in the process of buying a car right now and I'm super, like, diligent about it. I don't want to make any stupid mistakes or anything like that, so. Or do anything crazy, so. No, I’d say I’m really, pretty diligent when it comes to that sort of stuff, so.","Yep, two parent household Married happily um yeah no issues. I'm from Southern California.Always grown in the same place through my whole life. Um I ran a lot um I probably could've swam more more positive and more. But I didn't really have an issue swimming. Uh I read a lot of books. I talk to a lot of different people. I talked to a lot of people who had gone to BUDS all the way through and I feel like I just gathered as much information as they could. So my expectations were appropriate and stuff. Uhhh I read I read a lot of books when I was in like middle school, I'd say, and...you know, to be honest, first, it wasn't so much that I wanted to be a SEAL it was that I wanted to go to BUDS you know. I wanted to go to BUDS. That was like, that was the challenge and as I kinda learned moreI kind of thought that that would be a good job and maybe even a profession I'd find fulfilling. Uh yes, my brother was in the army. Grandparents were in the army in Korea, but it wasn't like I I do not come from a military whatsoever. Yeah, my uh dad my dad was very strict about sports,. And I had to...very similar, uh I don't know, very similar to the military in the sense that ""Ok we're gonna started. We're going to do these drills. We're gonna do this simulation. We're going to do X. We're going, you know, practice outside of practice. Uh so my brother was kind of a problem child I would say.  So I was just kind of quiet and just did what I was supposted to do cause I didn't want to give my parents more grief. So I kind of just I always felt like an easy job, but like I just kind of did what I was supposed to do because I was like, you know, even if I did act out of line they probably wouldn't have it in them have it in them to, like, discipline me so. So I played football and ran track. Okay, so my dad was really into me playing football. I was I was a pole vaulter in track. That's what I was about. I, to be honest I hated both, but I knew that track was a it was a means to an ends. So I uh graduated college in 2017. And then I worked in Phenix commercial real estate for about a year and a half. And then I joined the Navy. Uh, commercial real estate is very much like a good old boys kind of profession. Um I would run 4 miles every other day. I would swim 1500 meters on those off days. And then I would do some kind of leg workout every other day. So swimming and running would alternate. And then I would lift on the running days. So I um and so it's an additional to working commerical realestate I also worked at a restaurant. Um so I would work seven days a week. I would work easy seventy eighty, sometimes ninety hour weeks because I want to save a lot of money. And in addition to training. So I think that was the mental preparation where I would you know, I would go get in the office at 6 a.m. and then I would leave the restaurant at like 10 p.m. and then I would go work out for an hour or two hours. Sometimes yep. Sure um...uh so I bought a I bought a, now this is 2 or 3 years ago, I would say I am less impulsive now But like I bought a like used truck. Do those things specifically I just kind of signed up. So that's what I wanna do know uh and then when I joined the Navy, my parents saw that is very impulsive because they didn't know that I was they thought that I had kind of moved on that. OK. So, yeah, I don't have I don't have tattoos but.","Yes, they're both still married. Um, good. Um, no issues there, been pretty good, pretty well I’d say. Uh, Yeah for the most part. Close. Uh, so, grew up playing baseball. Um, played in high school and college, um, then stopped playing. pretty much, just a lot, I did a lot of sports growing up. So, no. I, I actually, um, stopped playing baseball, got out of college, um, moved to a different state. Um, and then, kind of was just doing oddball jobs, and then decided that I needed to do something with my life. And, decided to do this. No, I, I didn't even really know...I knew about Navy SEALs, but I didn't know anything more than that. I knew they existed. And uh, just decided to, just do it. so my grand-my grandpa was in the Air Force. I mean my dad wasn't in the military. Um, just, just kind of, randomly. No, um, I never even thought I would ever join the military. No, so I kind of researched it a little bit. I knew how to swim, cause I grew up in California. Or anything like that. Um, I trained for a little bit, maybe a few months, and then just, um, went ahead, went ahead and enlisted. Um, so my mom pretty strict, my dad, not so much. Uh, I mean, I went to like a, I went to a private christian school, growing up, for a few years. Um, but other than that, it wasn't like super crazy, but I would say my mom was on the stricter side. Um, I remember, she would, she would take things away, not let me go do things with friends, and um stuff like that. Um, maybe as a young child maybe I got spanked or something. No, I, uh, lived in the same house, uh, pretty much my whole life. Baseball, football. My dad was always there to help me with that. Um, I think it helped a lot. Um, cause there are some guys that I know that are in this program or were in this program that uh, didn't really play sports. I think it was a little bit harder for them to, like, adjust to that type of uh, atmosphere, in terms of the team, and not being selfish, I guess. So, I think that helped a lot. Knowing that, you know, everyone’s got to do something, to help, you know, make this work.  Uh, I went to a few different colleges. I got a scholarship to play baseball at Northwest Missouri State. Um, went there for a year. I played, didn't really like it. Kind of boring out there, and then moved back, went to (unintelligible, maybe general?) college, and then, following, I went to a school in California, Cal State Dominguez Hills. Um, and then I actually, just stopped playing baseball, was kind of just over it. Kind of like, thought it was a dead end. And then uh, actually moved to uh, San Antonio Um, kind of just up and left. It wasn't really planned either. Kind of just, just kind of went out. I don't know. I, I have uh, just an associates degree. That's all I have. So I uh, I actually got rolled in Prep. So I, um, went to boot camp, went to prep, got rolled two classes because of a calf injury. And then came out here with 3-8, um made it all the way to 3rd phase and then got rolled. And am here now. It was pretty, pretty, pretty horrible. I just, it was like, I didn't enjoy myself out there, nobody really does. It's pretty boring. Just got trapped. Um, but I think it helped me mentally, just going through hard things. Um, helps out a lot (unintelligible). Uh sometimes. Not in, not in all aspects, but in some, some things I guess. Um, just depends. Um, I've always wanted to just, to do something with my life, you know? I felt like I wasn't really doing anything, um, I don't know, I just, I didn't want to live and die and there be no you know, nothing good to say about me. No tattoos. No, I’ve only gotten one ticket","Uhh it’s a great, great uhh relationship. My dad’s actually a SEAL. He was until I think about like 9. I think the last deployment he went on was about 10 years ago. I uhh he didnt, he didnt really tell me much, but I , I’ve been on this base before a ton as a kid when I was like 11. Umm I did like uhh a big part of why I like or uhh wanted to be a part of this is this is because how I grew up umm I grew up around military. Like my grandpa, my Dad’s dad he’s a green beret. My mom’s dad was my age when he got drafted into Vietnam. Umm just something I knew I wanted to do umm it. Like exposure umm i think umm like I’ve definitely been around like a lot of SEALs I think thats a lot of the reason why I wanted to do it. Not really, I mean umm uhh I can’t really think of anything uhh i mean uhh, even joining the Navy that was a rough time uhh. Me and my brother couldnt get in uhh we got disqualified from MEPs. Uhh so when I graduated high school in 2018 I just, me and my brother were just in limbo til like half a year, trying to get in like it was medical umm we both had like childhood asthma as a kid uhh they gave us a lot of problems for that uhh and it was like uhh like I didnt know what to do because I’ve wanted to do this for so long umm so it was a rough time I think so uhh all I could think of. Uhh I got a job. I worked at a restaurant, My brother was working at uhh Walls, we were just working out uhh going to work. About it uhh. It was definitely tough uhh really rough. My mom was uhh telling me you gotta sign up for college and I knew I wanted to come here and I got uhh a scholarship to go to SDSU umm I kinda like gave that up to come here. Finding out that I couldn't join was really uhh disheartening for me. It took a while, but uhh we got a waiver umm but we took like four umm lung tests, tested our breathing, medicine and all this stuff and we were finally in the clear and they gave us waivers and we went to MEPs in December and we shipped out to bootcamp in February. Umm my Grandad was Army Special Forces, he’s a Green Beret. Uhh that definitely uhh having that and my Dad and my Dad’s friends I treat them like uncles I’ve known them for so long like a lot of military umm like every male figure in my family was military soo I something really wanted to do. Umm I was really like big in the water umm when I was like two my Dad had uhh taught us how to swim. Uhh when we were like eight my brother had already made the club swim team. SO we were really big in swimming and water so umm. Of course my grand- my grandpa was in the Army so like I never really considered that umm I kinda umm wanted to do like the hardest thing, the best thing, the most challenging thing umm. You have like the Green Berets and like the PJs and all the other ones I really wanted umm the toughest one, the hardest one and the most rewarding one umm revolving around teamwork being a good teammate and being a good man overall. Umm my parents were really strict but umm strict in a loving way like umm I knew it was just disciplining umm they did it out of love umm I kinda got that vibe from them umm. I was. All that stuff, my parents, I remember what they told me like no Cs no even Bs only As like even in preschool like strive for the highest umm like a bi, big portion of who I am today I thank them for it. It definitely umm really helped me strive for big goals ya know. No I never moved. In high school, I did wrestling and cross country. .Uhh I definitely liked cross country more, but cross country I definitely enjoyed like umm I was overweight as a kid until freshman year I did wrestling and I kinda lost a lot of weight and kinda got fitter over my high school years. Uhh I just uhh I loved uhh I feel in love with competition and just being challenged with uhh like cross country like umm when you're racing and you’re next to the other guy and you’re just racing and at the end your toe to toe I just kinda love that feeling of where you just sprint ahead of him and having more heart and even in wrestling like uhh the nervousness of going against someone before a match uhh I just really fell in love with being competitive and winning and uhh basically it. Umm I graduated in 2018 and about a month before a month or two before I graduated I went to the Navy recruitment office and got the paperwork going and uhh the whole thing about the medical after a while it worked out, just working out really hard, uhh got a job uhh and it was a really big deal uhh deal for my family. We didn’t have anything to do and we didn't want to go to college it was really the only thing we wanted to do and we finally got in. 6 months about from when I got in to when I graduated. Uhh not really. I like to know what I uhh what I get into a lot of times.No tattoos or speeding tickets.","Yep I’ve got great parents, had a really good childhood they’ve always been together, been together for about 35 years now. So yep I’ve got great parents my dad is 58 years old and my mom is 53 I think. Close, really close. My whole family is really close, always has been. Family is very important to me and everyone in my family. Umm yeah so I was really lucky growing up, my parents were always super supportive,with like everything I did, it didn’t really matter umm like I said I’ve always been into sports and stuff like that but if all of the sudden I would say I didn’t want to play a sport they would be fine with it, they would never force me to do anything. Umm and same with coming to the military, wanting to come to BUD/S, they were very supportive right away so they’ve always been easy to deal with in that aspect, i’ve always felt like I had a really good foundation from them, so. Yeah, so I went to high school and graduated, played sports in high school and then I decided not to play sports in college because, I wanted to play baseball in college and then decided last second that I wasn’t going to, so I just went to the University of Nebraska, graduated from there, uhh I studied business management and it took me, I had to do one extra semester so I graduated December 2018 and then shipped out to Boot Camp in February. I grew up in Nebraska, I lived in a small town, Nemaha Nebraska until I was 7 and then my mom got a job up in Lincoln so we moved up to the capital city, lived there ever since, so pretty much grew up in the city but a lot of my family members are from the country. My grandparents are farmers so I got a lot of experience with the rural life and all that stuff. Yeah, yep I would go down there and help them, help him, helped my grandpa a lot. Umm just because I thought they were the best of the best, you know? Just kinda the stereotypical things that you hear reading all the books and watching all the movies. The videos just looked awesome to me, sounded like they were the best of the best. So you know, some of these guys in here thought about being a Green Beret or a PJ, all those different things, but for me you know this was the only thing that I wanted to do umm I don’t know it didn’t have anything to do with the water. I know a lot of guys join because they like water. Umm for me it just looked like the hardest thing to do so that’s what I wanted to do. No I didn’t know anyone previously, I had met a few guys who like uh they have mentorship programs and stuff like that and I had a few friends that joined SEALs so I was able to train with them before I came but no I didn’t have any family members or anybody close that I knew that was a that was a SEAL previously. Uhh my dad’s dad was infantry in the Army, he fought in the Korean war. That was it. My other grandpa didn’t end up getting drafted because he was a farmer um and then I think some of my grandpa’s brothers were in the army but that didn’t really play into my decision to join the military. Um I would say college I was kinda my junior year of college I started to really think about what I wanted to do. I’ve always kinda had this in the back of my head I had a couple buddies that wanted to come here as well so we were kinda training for it together and then I would say between my junior and senior year of college I kinda said you know this is what I want to do. I told my parents and everything, really got serious about training um and then like I said as far as coming to BUD/S this was the only thing that I was really looking at. I didn’t really look at the Marine Corps or Army or any of that stuff um I had some outside influences from a couple of my friends that were thinking about it as well. I had one buddy, a training partner that came here with class 337 and we kinda trained throughout college together. Um yeah I mean my parents weren’t like super strict they also they wouldn’t just let me get away with everything. Um I could usually always get away with things with my Dad more than my Mom for sure. Um but yeah they weren’t super strict its not like I was getting grounded all the time but they definitely kept me on the straight and narrow like school was very important to them that’s one thing they did not tolerate at all you know was me jacking around at school getting into trouble. Um I mean I was always a pretty good student at school. I knew when to lock it on and not mess around so as far like punishing me I used to get spanked as a little kid … getting grounded, I would get grounded. I was pretty stubborn as a kid so like I would always try to get myself out of it … I mean but yeah they weren’t overly strict but also they wouldn’t just let me do what I wanted. Yep yep I played football basketball baseball in highschool, loved sports that’s like all I did, kept me out of trouble. Like I said baseball that was my big thing I wanted to play in college. For me though it was like if I couldn’t play division one I didn’t want to play and that’s basically what happened that’s why I didn’t continue to play in college um but yeah sports was my life. I guess its just like the relationship, all my friends played sports and um that’s all we would do. When I was a kid we would always play football out in the backyard, baseball um … in middle school we would travel all around the country I was on a travel team playing baseball so that was pretty much my life. Uh and I just loved it I loved the team aspect like I said all my best friends were guys I played sports with so I was always a huge fan growing up we would always go to Nebraska football games every Saturday. Yeah it’s just always something I’ve been into my whole life, I love sports. Yeah I mean I had a lot of jobs in college, a lot of manual labor. I used to roof houses I worked on a ranch for a while for like a year. In college I worked at Coors in college, got free beer that was big um yeah a lot of like outdoorsy jobs I’ve always been a pretty outdoorsy guy, never really wanted to just sit at a desk so I just went after that. I graduated in December of 2018. Impulsive? … Sometimes. Um, … man … just when there’s any opportunity to do anything fun I’ll go after it and sometimes that doesn’t benefit me you know there’s definitely times I could stay in and be more productive but if people are going out I’ll go out .. um yeah just like in college any trips that people wanted to take I was always in for that. So yeah sometimes I’m definitely an impulsive person but not to the extent where its super negative. No tattoos. Nope I think I have one speeding ticket, which actually kinda surprised me. I don’t drive like a maniac but there’s definitely guys like that like my buddy (unintelligible) driving like an idiot. But no, no tattoos no speeding tickets um as far as like run ins with the law … in college I got one MIP (minor in possession) that was like my sophomore year I wasn’t like crazy drunk or anything I was just having a beer at this, it was my fault I was having a beer at this place and didn’t have a wristband it was stupid. Like I said I wasn’t drunk at all, wasn’t a huge deal um went through that whole process or whatever. The Navy knows that I have that, that’s it. That’s all that I’ve had.","Uh a little bit my dad was in the Navy but he got drafted uh in Vietnam. Um but I have two cousins who’re brothers uh and they were officers in the teams. Uh just growing up like they were the uh they were just like the biggest role models like and everyone in the family looked up to them and they were just always happy. Yea tha-my cousins, they were brothers. Um and uh got like pictures of like like a family vacation and they’re just like throwing me in the air into a pool. Um yea they were uh yea they were just uh role models for me and um I-I just wanted to kinda be the type of man that they are. A-a little bit. I check in with them on uh on my progress is going, they’ll yea they’ll throw in some tidbits of advice 
Yea um my parents had different ways of disciplining um my mom she yelled uh a little bit and uh I don’t know I’ve probably only heard my dad raise his voice once in my life uh it was kinda worse with my dad because if you screwed up uh wasn’t mad he was just disappointed. And that was way worse. Um yea so. Um. I got spanked maybe like once or twice that’s about it. Yea. Yea there was definitely um yea definitely like threats of like taking away a phone or car or like uh you know you can’t go do this on the weekend or whatever, it wasn’t anything crazy um
Yea um I stayed in so I was born and raised in Santa Barbara um and we always stayed there but we definitely moved some houses um it’s like um when my parents got divorced my dad stayed at the house he built and then my mom moved um to another house and then my dad had to sell the house um so I-I’ve moved houses a lot. No no not really 
Um uh I was on sports teams my whole life bu- so I played water polo and swam in high school. Uh I was uh Boy Scouts uh from a super young age till I was like 17. Yea, yea I got my Eagle Scout um what else, I was I was a beach lifeguard for 6 years, um that was awesome loved that job yea
Yea I-I did a year in Colorado at UC Boulder um. Then I did a year and a half at city college back home, Santa Barbara City College, uh where I was doing uh just I got my Associates in the only degree that didn’t really require Math which was Communications um um. Yes. Um I I didn’t really like school and I-from a young age I’ve always known that I wanted to do this so I just decided to send it, um did jiu-jitsu um um. Worked a lot. Uh lifeguarding the whole time. No yea I wouldn’t consider my-. I have one speeding ticket um I don’t ever want to repeat that um. Yea. Um yea no tattoos I no I-I think things through for sure. Nothing on a whim no. Pretty good at saving, investing yea nothing crazy. ","Yeah we're really close. My whole family is pretty much I mean, just really close, yeah. I grew up all over the place. I was born in Wyoming. And didn't live there very long and moved to a Eskimo village in Alaska. Then I moved from there to Central America for three years and then I moved to Guam. We were Christian missionaries. And then he joined the army. Went to Hawaii. Not anymore. He's out. So initially like I always kind of knew. I didn't really know what like America was growing up in, like, little Eskimo village. I didn't really hear about a whole lot about the homeland, I guess. But then I was like, I have this great idea of bing like a soldier that's like cool to me. I don't know why. And then I saw, like, I kind of found out what it was about, like a trailer in a movie that I wasn't allowed to watch. So it kind of developed from there into something, obviously. It's like you're rocking the chair a little bit. That is kind of more romanticized. That's cool. It's still cool, but it's like. Yeeah now there's like a purpose behind it. Spankings. Yeah, spankings. We didn't do time out. I don't even know like. I mean, it guess it could be useful, but it's definitely there's something to be said about kids misbehaving, spank em, shake them up I guess. I definitely think so. Obviously not in the moment. But looking back, I mean, respect the style of parenting. Very. Not like strict strict parents but definitely like firm. You know, you're being a little naughty boy I mean obviously. So, Wyoming, I think, it was like when I spent my first year of life there. Then turned five in Alaska. Almost six moved to Central America, that is where my mom is from. Grew up from like six to almost 11, almost 11 years old. I mean, almost. Hawaii 10-11 to 17. And then 18 I moved to Missouri. Or 18 in bootcamp. Uh, I spent five months in Virginia. Just moving with my family. I surfed a lot in Hawaii a bit some competitive surfing. But not too much. I had, like, this dream of, like going pro, but obviously, like, it's not going to happen obviously. But um, I played soccer and I don't know, I kind of heard. My buddy Swartz were talking about like, each sport he played was his favorite sport. Like I kind of switch interest a lot. Things that I took an interest in, like surfing. I was like, oh, well, that's surfing. You know, when I started soccer. I'm like, OK, forget surfing I'm all about soccer. It's kind of like that. And that was the sport I played all the way through. And after, through high school. Honestly, I would say no. Just cause like I feel like I didn't really play on like a team, whereas like I was rather good. Uh, I played on it like a travel soccer team. Everyone comes from different schools. But you all come together. To play and you're not like they were all pretty good friends but I was new to the team. So they have like as deep friendships. I was just there to play and we all pretty much love playing as one team. That was one thing we had in common. I don't know. Definitely nothing, really. I mean, here it is so much different. Just that, like, we're all actually like good friends. More so, like instead of just we're just playing with the other like here it's like we're playing together. It's so like for reall. We're bros. And friends outside of work. I mean the stakes are a lot higher obviously. I would say one way that I really need to work on is I have a hard time saying no to people. So if I have plans to go do something and someone like, you know, you want to go do this and say yes to that right away without even thinking about it. Ok, I already have all these other plans that I said yes too. That's one way. I'm definitely like, it's a bad thing that I'm impulsive. So I've been trying to get my finances under wraps. Which is definitely good to do at a younger age. But you know I've gotten away from impulsive buying. I did buy a car after Hell Week that I needed to.","Two parent household. Great I talk to them often, had kind of a normal suburban middle class lifestyle. Always in the same place. I went to Iowa State University. Yes, I graduated in 3.5 years. I was in bootcamp two months later. Enlisted. Uh… at 17 I originally wanted to but I don’t think I had the maturity and physicality to do it so I decided to go through college and kind of reassess later. And towards the end of college I decided that I wanted to do it. I didn’t really look at any other unit or any other place in the military besides this. Uh … I actually found out later my dad was also thinking about being a SEAL back before his love of engineering kind of took over. But uh I don’t know we were always kind of pushed to do like the best so I knew I wanted to do something with Special Operations you know because they’re special. And that’s when I found that the SEALs were the best of the best. Uh I had to uncles in the Air Force and my grandfather was in the Army but nothing really like my parents weren’t in the military … nothing really around this realm. Like I said when I was 17 I decided I wanted to do something a little more active. I wanted to do it then but then next thing I went to college and then I might want to do something with law enforcement. I always knew I wanted to do something active it was just whether it was the military or what. January 2018 was when I actually joined. Let’s see … an internship opportunity kind of fell through so I knew that uh I knew that it was going to be nearly impossible to do law enforcement that and its also impossible to get into right out of college without experience and I’m like alright I’ll do something else cool and I’m like alright I’m going to do this at least for a number of years Um I was a kid that went to Sunday school every Sunday. We were … were were pretty well behaved kids we didn’t do anything really stupid. Yeah we had our friends and you know went ... I don’t know it was a pretty normal upper middle class suburbs life. I can’t think of a time that my parents had to really like come down hard on us … they disciplined us whenever we did something bad as a kid but we never did anything really stupid. Yeah we got spanked but that was about it. No not really. I played hockey for ten years … baseball for nine … and football for three years in high school. And I played volleyball too when I was in college. Track too, but for football the bond with the guys too was so much more. I played ten years of hockey but in three years of football I felt much more of a bond with the guys. I mean we were a winning team but I don’t know the guys were just always … we would have fun and … I don’t know I can’t really describe it the guys were just really good. We were a winning team so that helped winning so much we were able to just relax sometimes. Knowing that guys went through the same thing or guys working together to achieve the greater goal and … just being around like minded individuals. I mean I was lifting, working out, living a healthy lifestyle. I participated in intramural sports um I was in a fraternity in college … that was kind of like a little bit of that brotherhood aspect but not nearly as much as here. Yeah just went to college and lived the college lifestyle and had fun but that’s kind of why I graduated in 3.5 years you know I did everything that I wanted to and there wasn’t much left for me. Impulsive… um … I wouldn’t say so.","I have two parents, my mom and my step dad uh my step dad has been around since I was two he’s my dad. They’re very supportive, they’re loving, pushing us to strive for our best. Um just two houses. Um Tucson Arizona. Straight from high school I looked into colleges but uh wasn’t really focused on the school aspect of it and said you know might as well go for it. Yeah so I went to bootcamp in July of 2018 I was 17 at the time and had my mom sign a form. I would mainly say that my mom was very strict so it correlates very easily with instructors being up your butt all the time just like my mom, she also never let me have an excuse and was like you know what you want to do so get it done. I came out here and they treat me just like my mother did. Um there was just no room for error, she knew from a young age that I wanted to come out here and do this so she always held me accountable and just never let me slack off. Sit on the couch too long and she would make you go find something to do. Um I was about eight years old at a family barbeque and uh I knew I wanted to be in the military from a young age and my uncle was like the Navy SEALs are the best of the best so if you want to be the uh best warrior be a Navy SEAL and I said OK and ever since that day. Nope uh nobody was uh except for my grandfather he was a Marine in World War II. Uh I was just I always liked structure like uh I had like an internal clock like at this time I wanted to get ready so I always wanted to be something structured and always thought being a solider was cool so I wanted to be a soldier as a kid. So uh my mom was definitely always the ruler of the household uh she said something everyone goes by it, my dad was always more of the supportive dad. Supported what she said of course but also behind her back helps us out uh he could also be strict at times too especially for me too since I’m the oldest boy. Uh young age there was spanking and then when I got a little too old for that they would just make me sit in my room. Uh teenage years I just uh did a lot of skip school and try to go get McDonalds uh … other than that just go mess around in the desert on the rocks you know. Uh it depends on what the class was I liked history I liked of course PE but math I hated math but always understood it very well so I was always in the accelerated math classes but didn’t want to sit in the class and do it so I would always be the joker in the class or just sit in the class and doodle. Uh I liked the teamwork, just like the competitiveness of it, of course the big stadium lights. Uh definitely you have to work as a team here if you can’t be a team player then you have like rips and tears. Everything works better as a team of course there’s also like individual work here just like football if you’re not going to go out on your own and workout its not going to correlate like skillswise … it just helps you with like you got to win the big game all the time. Yes high school straight to bootcamp and then BUD/S. Uhm no looking back at it it was like really short when I graduated and joined the Navy but uh I had been thinking about it for years prior it was just finally time to be serious. No I don’t have any speeding tickets. I want to get a tattoo but you know, got to wait.","Uh yeah, divorced at I think I was like two so separate households from then on and then … kinda bounced school districts in the middle of high school like in 10th grade I went from living with my mom my whole life to living with my dad so dealt with that whole move and then switching of the schools and then unfortunately after college I was almost done with college I moved to Philadelphia to do so and then I lost my father … so then came after college moved in with my aunt and uncle while looking for a job. Yeah right outside of Philly it’s called Eastern University. Always just trying to be the best in any aspect whether its growing up I played a lot of sports so trying to be the best guy out there or the competitiveness so trying to win everything so going through that and growing up hearing different options of what you want to do and you hear that they’re the best in the world it definitely peaks an interest because where better to go than to be the best of the best. No it was just my one buddy who would always talk about it with me in wrestling in high school but unfortunately he didn’t end up going through with me. Um I would say a little bit of everything so like the wooden spoon whenever something would happen … or getting sent to your room … I guess that isn’t a punishment… but yeah it was the wooden spoon until one time they hit me with it and it broke and I laughed and I guess that was the end of that. So growing up it was sports all year round. It went from baseball in the spring to wrestling in the winter and football in the fall so I didn’t even have a break and sometimes I would miss the first couple practices because that other season was still going on so it was just like day in and day out … and that wasn’t like a punishment I liked that. Um when I was young no whatever sport I was doing was my favorite of all time but when I got older I had to give up football in high school because there wasn’t enough time and then when I got to college I had to give up wrestling just because baseball took over everything. So in college in my senior year … I tore my shoulder apart, had surgery on my rotator labrum and bicep tendon so that was part of the recovery. I immediately came home and got a job working at a warehouse for Amazon and while I was doing that just from playing sports growing up I was big into weight lifting so that was a big part of my regiment then so I would say it was probably about a year into working at Amazon I decided that I just wasn’t … this was not for me I was not enjoying it I didn’t like working behind a desk and if I was going to pursue this thing with the Navy you know I was already twenty-six so time was already dwindling down. Yep so then boot camp and I had to jump through all these hoops because of my shoulder but then yeah it was bootcamp for two months then Prep for a month and then out here to start this process. No I mean I do have two tattoos but nothing too crazy. No I don’t think I have any speeding tickets. Purchases … no not really. So I guess not … not for this aspect anyways.","I don't really know. I kind of I think I learned about them on a young age. I don't really know exactly how. And then-. Uhhh uh. My dad was a sheriff's officer for like 28 years, and I probably had a lot to do with it because he, like I saw how much he helped other people. I knew that was part of something I wanted to do. I would like to help people and might do something greater than just ourselves. I don't even, I think, it was along the time, when like all the books and movies and everything were coming out. And I think I watched Lone Survivor one day or something and I decided to read the book. And that led me into reading like quite a few different books, kind of like researching it more. And I was not really a big reader. And when I started reading more and like, learnin' more, I was like, ""Wow. I'm actually interested in this."" So that's what kind of sparked it. As I'll learned more, I just got more like into it. And I was like, ""I want to do this."" Yes. Uh, it was kinda, I was spanked as a kid, but my mom and my dad really had different styles. My mom was like definitely very strict growing up. And Dad was more like, like good buddy. Like mentor. Like me. We hunted all the time together, played baseball. He coached a lot.... But he never, he was never like on my case but as much as a mom. 
Yes. It was more like the disappointment speech. I never, I don't really think I had things taken away. Well, like being in the same area. We moved, of course, like our parents divorced and then they both remarried. And later on, they moved and moved away from like where my original house. But we still- were in the same community. I never moved away. Yeah. We- I play baseball growing up, from like, I started when I was like four. And then when I was eight, we had to travel team that I played with until like pretty much high school, played high school baseball. And that I definitely got that ""team""- I was always used to being on a team and had a close knit group of guys that were always there that definitely like, was part of the reason I want to come here just like that team and knowing you can count on the dudes. Yeah. So like I worked in the summer, but then after college, after I left college, I spent at a year just working and like working out gettin ready to do it here. Like right at a year. Nah,  It was mainly just physical training. I don't. [chuckles]. 
Not really. Nah. Yeah. ","Mmm no not really um pretty normal life, nothing crazy happened. Um yea um so grew up in North Carolina just stayed there my entire life, born and raised in the Outer Banks um went to elementary school, middle school uh was kind of trouble kid I guess um. I was. Uh teachers called my mom alot uh played baseball um. Just like uh like talking in class or like just like horse playing really just like messing around with my friends when I shouldn’t have been messing around with my friends um. No no no no nothing like that nothing like that just uh like phone calls home Hunter was talking in class alot, asked him to stop, he wouldn’t stop like stuff like that. Exactly. Um and then in high school uh just skateboarded alot and then um played baseball till like my junior year and then quit playing um went to college and then stopped going to college after like 2 years and came here.. Um I think uh being able to have a sense of like uh sick sense of humor like in the twisted type when you go through is a huge factor in it um seems like like all the all the dudes I-I’m close with like they all are pretty consistent in the fact that they have uh they have a way of laughing things off when we probably shouldn’t be laughing. Um I think both um if if everyone’s like a solid member, it definitely helps out the team but uh like definitely definitely personally I-I think it helps moral whenever you can joke about something when it’s not exactly going your way. Um. I don't think so. Uh I’d say um I’d say I’m extroverted probably yea um but nah I just think uh like more than anything I’m probably just like one of the dudes that jokes around the most yea. Mmm. No um. I do, my-my Dad was a Marine um he-uh-he had a pretty cool career he had a bronze star with valor um but my entire li-cause my mom like knew my disdain for school she was like well you’re either going to college or joining the military like you’re-you’re not gonna be a bum or whatever so she always pushed pretty hard for me to join the military but I was like super anti-military like did not want to do it whatsoever um I was a big skateboarder so like I thought I was gonna have a career in skateboarding. And um. X-games or something like that yea um like I started-started getting sponsors and stuff, I thought I was gonna be like able to do that as a career, uh turns out I wasn’t um and then yea just one day I uh I went to the recruiter and uh I wanted to be air traffic controller and um he told me about the PST and so I uh took the PST um got a contract and then figured out BUDS and boot camp figured out about BUDS and boot camp and um just been along for the ride ever since. Mhm. Um. Uh all the above, mom was pretty uh pretty hard on me she um she like grew up with a single mother so she like didn’t (unintelligible) for a little bit, she didn’t like want me to be a jerk so yea if I got in trouble she would-she would hit me or like take my things away she was-she was pretty uh strict my entire life um like you know, always had to know where I was going and who I’d be with and stuff like that, she was very much so into that. No um like in the area but like like I was born and raised in the Outer Banks like stayed there. Till I came here. Yes ma’am. No. No. Uh I was, I was competing with uh I did play baseball from the time I was like 12 till probably like 16 um I played like pretty competitively I guess like AAU uh showcase teams things like that um. I quit. Yes... Um everyone just kinda like I-I really just like the sport everyone kinda started taking it really seriously and uh it seemed a lot less about how fun it was and like firs-first everyone thought they were gonna be a professional baseball player than like just enjoying playing the game um so I didn’t really like that about it um yea I played up until junior year and then just lost the love for it I guess but uh started skateboarding when I was probably like 14 and then I think that kinda replaced baseball which also helped chauffeur that out of my life. The... The culture and the people are huge it was um it’s like uh like it’s like cliche but like it was like skate culture is a whole different thing and um no it was it was really cool like uh it took really hard work like you weren’t gonna be good at it without like slamming your head off the ground multiple times like took a lot of hard work um and it was like something that like everyday if you didn’t practice, you weren’t gonna be good so it was cool. I had some college um. 2 years of college. Um I just didn’t like school, I-I went to kinda appease my mom because she said I was either going to college or joining the military and I didn’t want to join the military so college it was. Um but yea I really had no interest in going to college um I was before or during and while I was in college I managed a pizza shop and uh movie theater um 2 separate times, pizza shop and moved away from home and then got a job managing a movie theater so I was doing that while going to school um yea. No no. Um yes. I do. I have 2, both my tattoos I got on a whim. Um but yea I think I think I would actually definitely consider myself impulsive. Um I don’t like..same thing going back to the school I got like pushed in the envelope um and kinda like having fun with life I guess. Um I’ve gotten a lot of-I’ve been pulled over a lot for seat belts but I’ve never gotten a seat belt ticket but... I don’t wear seat belts. No I hate wearing a seat belt. Yes. It is a comfort issue. Um no. No um I’ve only gotten in trouble in BUDS once and it was for losing something so. Losing something, you know .","Sure, yeah, yeah. Um...so I was first introduced to the SEAL teams in high school. I have a buddy who's currently on a SEAL Team. Um... Friend from high school yes. And then uh...went to college...uh played with a SEAL who had walked on our football team after his SEAL career was done. He was around 31, 32. Uh, yeah, it's pretty cool actually. Like ESPN did a whole story on him, so kind of got reintroduced back into the teams that way. And then just being in San Diego, you hear one off instances of like the SEAL teams and what they do and um...graduated from college, worked in accounting for a number of years before eventually deciding to, to join the teams. I sort of just missed that like team environment and the whole brotherhood aspect and meeting like a great group of guys. Like...it's definitely true that like you do this reason for the guys. I would say so. So they kind...overall that’s what led me back to BUD/S.  Yeah...definitely. OK. Yeah. Uh...so my family, my parents were pretty strict. Um...always went to school, came back, did my homework, check, would check my homework. Uh yeah. I was yup, i was yup, spanked. I would get the belt sometimes. No, no spoon...but um yeah definitely that and I would say was probably equal on both sides, both mom and dad. But yeah strict yeah. They've chilled out a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's kind of cool um...but yeah they're definitely way more relaxed and yeah. Just kind of hanging out. Nope. Born and raised in same town. Um...Stockton, California. Same house. Nope. Yeah, teenage years I...are mostly characterized, I would say, by sports. Just I would... Yeah, football, basketball, track...baseball. Team sports yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, all my best friends are...all played sports with me at some point, yeah.  Uh...last five years. So...I graduated in 15 and then I worked in accounting from 16 to...uh...towards I think like the end of 2017. And then I moved back in with my parents and um trained until shipping out in twenty nineteen. Yeah.  Uh...it was mostly running, swimming. So I would wake up, I would go swim in the morning, um... run sort of around midday, and then the late day would have some sort of like stretching or weightlifting session. And I did that for the extent of about the time that I was home. Yeah. Uh...no...I've never really been one for religion. Uh... mental exercises, no, I never...never really did any like meditation or anything. I think just the only sort of like constant pressure, I guess I would feel is like, you know, hey, you're still living with your parents or like you're living with your parents. You got to, like, start making moves and get out. And so I think that was always kind of like, OK, when am I going to enlist and ship out and do all that? I had always known that I was going to come here, but you just kind of like getting the ball rolling as, as, as far as life progression probably the only really mental thing that I was dealing with.  No, they had none of that. Yeah, I think as far as that stuff, it was it was more honed on, like actually just being in sports. I think like personally for me, I know I, I try to do a lot of that stuff subconsciously, but it's like I'm not really thinking about it. But I think we all kind of do that. But as far as training, specific training, no, I've never had that. Yeah. The tattoo question. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't consider myself impulsive. Nope. Mmm...aside from, like a laptop? Or something like that? No. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Definitely.","Uh, I actually met CDR Ledford at college, uh he was getting his PHD when I was there as an undergrad. And then, he was like the first person I ever talked to about uhm being a SEAL. I, I had like that idea of military, like some special operations, wasn’t sure. And he just kinda put a face to it and then that just slowly developed while I was in college. And then afterwards, uhm, decided to come out here and pursue this. Yeah the, the, or they’re biggest way would be to just take things away from us Or just kinda, I, I was I wasn’t a super rebellious kid by any means. Uh, my older brother kinda took the brunt of that, so I just sat back and Saw that. (laughs) No. No, I grew up in New Jersey and stayed there all the way through college, so comin’ out here was the first time I left. Yep. Yeah so I played soccer in high scool and college. So, basically grew up playing sports and was always, always playin’. Changed a lot, I ended as a forward. Uhm, that’s where like I finished played, but played defense my first couple years so. Yeah, I like liverpool. I was in .. Yeah, so I was in college and then put in the uh officer candidate school package. So that is like a year long process in itself to come out here. There’s a screener, so after college I put in my application and I coached for a year while I was going through this process to come out here. Uh, it was a youth club, so we were, we had teams between like U-10 and U-18. Okay, would you consider yourself impulsive? Like, do you have any tattoos or do you make? Definitely not. Definitely supported by the team. ","Yeah usually spanking or belt, kicked out of the house, stuff like that. We were kicked out of the house for like a week. Yeah, I would just hang out with friends. Oh yeah, they really brought their, both my parents are from the Philippines, so they brought uh some traditions back with them. Uh we bounced around a little bit but not nothing crazy um I’d say like when we were like 8 or 9 we bounced around a couple states but pretty much we settled when we were like 12, 13 and stayed there. Yeah just from Michigan to Ohio so just two states just for uh parents work. I played football, did uh wrestling and uh track as well. I’d say the heaviest was probably football, really got into that. Wrestling I really did only one year, my senior year and then track did 3 years, but mostly involved in uh really football and that when I got PT in football. Um just uh I was originally with Class 306 and that was 6 years ago so that really uh. Yep, so literally just getting back like the first few years was really every day just thinking about getting back and what am I doing to get back, so that was a big one, and then um. Oh I was uh performance dropped in uh week 3 of first phase. Performance failed or dropped. So just the really big drive to get back in it again, and then another big one was just family uh the death of my brother. The death of my uh brother was a big contributing factor keeping me going the last years. Oh yeah very he was killed by a uh drunk driver.","I remember timeouts. There was no real like physical punishment. They're both, both my parents kind of have similar parenting styles. My dad was more like me, so he was a little sterner, a little quieter. My older sister is six years older than the rest of us. She watched us a lot when my parents were out. She would baby sit for us a good amount. We moved when I was three or four. But other than that we stayed in the same spot. Cross country. Growing up I played all sorts of sports. But I ran cross country and track in high school. And then I did some road running in college. No tattoos. I wouldn't say I'm an impulsive person.","I never needed discipline. I never did anything wrong. That was really the only thing I ever did. Potentially I might have been whipped with the belt at one time. Most the time like more of a threat. Maybe it happened once, but there was definitely that overarching fear of the belt. Average strict. I switched high schools once in my sophomore year. We moved in with my stepdad. Played football, baseball, and basketball since I was nine. I went to college. I went from high school to junior college and then I went to four years. Two years, or a year and half and then three and a half years at college. Weber State. It's a school in Utah. I graduated from Weber State. Then from there I was in a teaching credential program for one semester. Then I did two years in a prerequisite for nursing school. Then I had a year off. Then I started nursing school. I started lifeguarding. Nusing school for two months, and then I joined the Navy. Then boot camp straight through now. ","My parents were very just non-discipline in the way they let me. They gave me a lot of freedom to make my own decisions and really, my dad, who would be, few times growing up, my mom, she would get more upset and show her disappointment with me. And that would really hit me hard. And my dad, a lot of times with my brother, like pulling him or whatever, and my dad would  get really pissed. Really, those two things. Just looking back, I think them being, I guess what I'm thinking of my dad, went to the Academy and played Football, same with his Dad, think lie growing up he was the oldest. His Dad was the oldest. I am the oldest brother. You'd think they just kind of feed into that, hey you're going to the Academy, but I had to pry to figure out what it was all about. I think that is the best idea of how it was. I didn't even play football. I started football late compared to my peers. I played soccer. Maybe a little different than what people would think. I started playing football three years late, compared to my peers. And then you look at who played at the next level out of the guys I grew up with. I was one of the couple. I think about the way it goes to me making this. 
Same house in Dayton, Ohio. My Dad was out of the military before we were born. Small neighborhood. Small town. I'm still close with a few of my buddies from home. To prep school then the Academy. Naval Academy Prepratory School. 
No, I don't have any tattoos. I think sometimes I do a good job of making quick decisions, but sometimes that's a poor qualifier because I do think a lot. I mean, let's say I'm purchasing things, we just had Black Friday or whatever. It would take a lot for me to actually pull the trigger. Not very impulsive. I think too much a lot of the time. ","Spankings, time out, groundings. Very strict. Same town, whole life. Small town. Baseball, water polo. Played in high school and college. I played at the Air Force Academy. I played water polo in high school and baseball up until high school. I played six to twelve, or fourteen. CU Boulder, master's program, worked, and then here. Went to University of Colorado after to get my master's. I switched at the second year mark. I was only there for two years and finished at Boulder, my bachelors. Then got my master's at Boulder, and then worked. I was an analyst at a casino for a little under two years. I analyzed blackjack table spreads. 
I don't have any tattoos. Impulsiveness depends on what. Fifty fifty. ","When I was young, it was spankings and timeouts. As I got older, it was weird, our parents treated the three of us differently based on, like for me, it was I didn't get ground much I didn't have a curfew. My older sister had a curfew. For me it was they gave me a lot of rope to hang myself, and I didn't get in much trouble for that, because I kind of valued that. I remember one time I was just making the wrong decisions for a couple of weeks straight, and my dad came in and he kind of gave me a talk. I kind of got defensive, but didn't you do this when you were my age? He goes, ""yeah, that's why I'm not expecting you to not do all this stuff. I just want you to be more responsible."" That was kind of my Dad's approach to me, just be responsible. They never had to really bring the hammer down. 
It was a small town, New Jersey, Central Jersey small suburb about an hour from New York. I stayed in the same house my whole life until I was twenty one, we moved, summer after my junior year of college, we moved two towns over. It was six thousand people, but it was as small as two square miles,. And you didn't know everyone, but you knew a lot of people when you worked out around. Little Silver in Central Jersey, it's a small county. 

I was going through college not really knowing I wanted to do this until my senior year. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, so it was ten thousand people, medium sized college. All four years. My senior spring, I joined twenty three, right before I turned twenty four. So senior year of college I decided I wanted to do this, finished up college, immediately get a lifeguarded again because it gave me time to train and everything. I put together an Officer package, went through the whole process, went to SOAS, summer of 2018, was notified 20 September 2018 I didn't get the contract. I already had dual processed for an enlisted contract. So as soon as I got that, I was like, Officer, it was rejected, I had my enlisted contract ready to go. And I took on jobs. In the school I was working in the development office, in my high school, before I went to SOAS, and then after SOAS I took on a job. I went back to lifeguarding. And then once that ended I took on a job as a waiter at a restaurant. Then I shipped to Boot Camp on February of 2019.

No tattoos. Not an impulsive person, I don't think so, no. I try to be frugal when it comes to spending. On others, I'll have this policy where I'm pretty cheap when I'm by myself, just because I know I'm going to be spending more with other people. ","I kind of always wanted to do this at a young age. In high school, I had a pretty serious knee injury and the doctors said that there was most likely no chance I would be able to do this. I was out of sports and everything for six months because of the recovery. It took me six months and I got into a pretty dark place in that time because I always wanted to do this and they told me I won't be able to do it. It was like an automatic disqualification. Then I decided once I got better. So I just decided to train anyway and hopefully I'd be able to do it. Ended up getting a waiver once I got through college. I think that time in high school , though, is probably like it was pretty hard times. I just wanted to do it so bad. I had no hope that I was going to be able to do so. I had to overcome that. "
"honestly it’s what I was saying earlier with the guys like I’m living with you know you try to sleep in one day and they are in your room yelling at you calling you names and stuff, it’s kinda cool. it sucks but it’s kinda cool at the same time. cohesion too and then ya just like trying to keep the family proud and everything as well cause my dads’ side is very tight knit. um and involved with messages and everything and everybody knows everything.
","that's a good question so I wanna be the best at ...Unintelligible… weight lifting or running or swimming or something like that so thinking that waking up their a little bit earlier to warm up ten minutes before trying to do that . yes. ya both ya actually so one of my mentors he kinda told me about this one percent rule and I kinda really I didn’t really understand what it meant at first but I it took me a long time to figure it basically said make yourself one percent better every single day when your doing so if your pulling yourself and go back in time the day before what did you do today that you didn’t do yesterday so try to better yourself one percent everyday 
",uhhh I I would say just trying to better than the person I was yesterday I think I think umm I think lifes in constant quest to get better and if I pay every single day I need to make sure I do something that makes me better than the human I was yesterday,"um well something that definitely you now uh grad getting to a SEAL team and deploying is the ultimate goal you know BUD;s at first now it’s not only getting to a SEAL team but being able to contribute something in a positive way once you get to a SEAL team. ya it’s more than just getting there being an asset 
",just getting just getting better and seeing other guys who are better than me makes me kinda want to push myself to be the best that you can be ,I think my family for sure. uh and uh definitely like not letting these guys down I think being like being a part of a team like that’s been such a constant in my life since the fourth grade when I started sports. it’s just so the better you do the better everyone does and uh just being driven by that like I live with guys and one of them is going to workout after this and now I’m going so it’s just like trying to get better and just competitions. ya I think competition are like ya ya I think peer Ya positive peer pressure. which is stimulated by this kind of environment. ,"so there are like you know cliche answers that are still basically true um you know coming in here and being with these guys once I’m here is huge like it’s you can’t be unmotivated being around this caliber of person um you now not not including myself these guys are just incredible you know I am very very uh its very humbling to work with them um but I would say legitimately just like the uh patriotism and like there is a conflict of good and evil in the world 100% and I think the fact like if if you know you don’t do anything when you are perfectly able and are in a position um especially being in this position you’re gonna be directly tasked with taking care of some serious issues like mitigating the amount of damage that evil can do for this way of life. So the AMerican way of lifes very motivating too and some people don’t have to worry about anything and its great cause you want to preserve that as much as you can. Um. 100% because ya because I think human beings, well I can’t say that um ya I feel like, I I was pretty selfish for a long time and you know being around these guys really, theres no room for selfishness its awesome, um I feel like I’m enjoying a lot of the freedoms that the American way of life has to offer and it’s definitely time for me to sacrifice you know for like thats another part of motivating me thats you know even if you look down on yourself for anything its like hey man you’ve enjoyed a lot so you know you signed up for this so do what you signed up to do um and do it to the best of your ability and just thats just pretty motivating just to get the most that you can out of it and the most that you can into it because those two are like directly related the more you put into it the more you get out of it and its not like like you’re taking away from this community selfishly it’s like you are just benefiting as a you are becoming a better person by being evolved in this community its it’s just pretty motivating like that’s motivating but that’s like a round about rabbit hole answer.. Ok, cool.. I don’t know what cliche means. ok. right. right ahh patriotism.. ","Um, well one you’re here for a goal and I’ll do whatever it takes to accomplish a goal, and two its just, you know, I feel like, when, again, playing baseball learning how to fail, it’s just a part of it, part of the process","Yes. Yes. I had some friends, both in a previous class and my classes ahead of me two that were really encouraging and helped me... Sort of deal with the challenge of having to come back. A couple of guys who are in this class now, actually, who had already been rolled from 334, for injuries or whatever, that they had sustained during first phase. I knew I was going to be classing up with them. So it was good to have them around during the time that I was rolled. Yes, I'm a strong Christian, so I pray quite a bit. And also kind of a weird little saying, but, uh something that would just help me stay focused. As I would just say, this is what I'm doing right now. You know, no matter what was going on, if my mind started to wander and I started to wonder, like, hey, you know, it's pretty sweet if I weren't out here in the search zone right now. I would just repeat myself, ""this is what I'm doing right now"". It doesn't matter what I could be doing. This is what I am doing. Just help me calm, stay grounded in the present moment.","A lot of self talk.  Uh, no. It wasn't a really matras, I never even really about training. I would just kind of talk to myself. It took one mind off, whatever was really happening, and essentially forgot about everything that was going on. And like, I always thought about, like what I was, ""oh, my car's broken down."" What I to do to it this weekend, I thought through- like I said, I need to work on this part, work on that. So I was kinda, I always kinda mentally just, especially during the more challenging ""not this"" evolutions, took my mind out of it and put it someplace else. So it's like something that happens, ""Oh, wow yeah, training."" Yeah. and it depends. So like they were- in the evolution that required focus, by, for instance, in third phase, when were doing IADs, I'd say that it's definitely more of a,  focus mode, but if it was something like a two and a half mile swim that was like extremely long. I would just, start thinking about other things and just completely forget about the swimming portion so, that autopilot, I feel like that helped, had they talked about how difficult... 
","That's, I think just looking for the guy to the left and right of you. It's like, you knowl don't do it for yourself, do it for the guy next to you. So if you're gone, they're going to be carrying more weight because you're gone. So in order to continue on, you have to make sure the guy next to you is OK, because that's what really matters. Yes. Yes, I did. I mean, I was fortunate enough- the guys in my boat crew who were also of similar heights. You know, I think I was fortunate to have a group of solid guys who we became very close with. So that driving factor of, ""I care about these guys. I want them to succeed as much as I want to succeed."" So I think that really is what pushed me all the way through. I think it would be my mentors, people that I talked to when I told them, like, I'm going to do this, like you said, to do this dream go all the way. You're not going to come back until you fail so-. Ummm, no it was more so at the end of the day, it's like, hey, ""I made it through another day."" I can tell them that I'm continuing on. But in a moment, It was the guys that drived me. I said the simple mantra in my head, it was, kind of, you know, ""Brothers do it for them. And that was just in the same vein for the guys that I did not do it for them."" So I would tell myself that things are rough. It's a very broad thing, but, you know, it kind of encompasses the guys beside me as well as, you know, my family and friends back home. 



",I hated failing and I was embarrassed.,"Um, well I've always seen this as a philosophical quest.",,"And I didn't think, you know, OK, like, this really starts right now like I don't have to be here. And I mean, I think a lot, yes. I think a big component say, well, my buddy still here so.","Uh, Definitely could not call my wife and tell her I quit, so I just wasn't going to do that.",And my family umm my dad my mom umm i feel like umm growing up in this kinda environment umm I couldn’t come home if I wouldn’t umm succeed,,"Yea uh this was during hell week it really came out it was kinda like our class thing um sorry if I swear. Alright uh it was just I have this video from our hell week um one of the instructors took of us just crawling around in the water on like Thursday morning uh chanting “It doesn’t fucking matter” so it was like our thing was like it doesn’t matter what you do to us or like how much it sucks, I-I’m not going anywhere. Yea a little bit. ","I would say what I get from my girlfriend. Just that, you have a really strong relationship. Just being able to be like, OK, today was a bad day today sucked and if I can look forward to calling her and, you know, almost in a way like you're a baby a little bit.",I … I just knew there was no way in hell I was going to quit.,,,"Not really, no. [Chuckles]. So I just went in to everything. ","Um just wanting to pass um like I like I was capable of passing the 4 miles or it was just like like it was hard like it was uh definitely a put out for me to get across the finish line. Mhm. Mhm. Running was not fun. Um I don’t know uh maybe just like (unintelligible) um just like being able to imagine what’s on the other side of the 4 mile um realizing that like it is like it’s just a 4 mile and like my life will soon cease to be just 4 mile timed runs like it will be better. Um I’d say that’s it. Yes. Absolutely yea um I met some of the greatest dudes here um like best friends like all all of them feel the same way everyone hates 4 miles you know it’s not like I know it’s-it’s not just me having that idea um. I want to say no but like I’m I’m sure there’s something like uh….um actually yea there was uh there was this movie called Fury um it’s about, I think Brad Pitt’s in it, but they’re like tankers like back in the day I don’t remember which war. Um but they always said uh best job I ever had. So maybe that. Out loud yea to my buddies like it was kinda a funny thing cause obviously it sucked we were saying it’s the best job we ever had and it clearly was horrible","Uh...I think I had just like...didn't want to leave my friends. I had come so far. Like, I've invested just a lot of time into this whole this, this whole pipeline. And I think the more I get into it, the more, you know, obviously the more skin that I'm putting in. And so at this point, it's like I'm sort of all in and it just kind of snowballs. You don't...you know, it's just like, why would I quit now? You know? Why would I leave to leave and...leave my buddies? Yeah. Yeah, I thought about my family a lot. Um...you know, feeling the shame of, like, telling my dad or my mom that like hey I quit or I got rolled or something happened. Um...yeah, that, that definitely weighed on me a bit. Uh, nothing like that. I remember, though, for, like specifically the OC-8 test, I would go back to my room and like write down, try to like recollect and rethink like, OK, what did I do that day? What did I do wrong? What do I need to do right? And just sort of like I could see something on paper and go, OK, just try to do that next time and um think about that like during the evolution. And like before OC-8 I was, I was on the pool that just going through kind of like, OK, remember the key points that you wrote down last night? Try to do those. If you do those, you're going to be successful, so.




","Definitely supported by the team.Uhm, everybody’s gonna have their, their days. I wouldn’t say one that stands out to me too much, but just like I, I have a lot of memories and just like the guys keeping you like in your perspective and just realizing where you are and being lucky to have such great people around you. ","Um I’d say just the guys next to ya, or the guys next to me that was the biggest thing just seeing them, if they were having a bad time just it can’t be that bad obviously you want to help out your buddy you grow and you form really good connections with em so like you really wanna see your good friends make it through as well, you do whatever you can to get em through.","I'd say expectations from other people, and meeting them. Keeping their respect. ",I've already tried everything else. ,"My faith. I'd say it's probably the number one thing. I try to always make that the number one thing. I always try to use the gifts God gave me and pull them. A follow on to that is family and blood family. But also the family that I've made throughout my life. Whether it's high school and then the Academy, Sprint Football family. It's always who and what I represented. Not just myself. When things get tough that's usually what comes to my mind first. I think of like Jesus on the cross just to try to put the pain in perspective. ",Keeping money in my pocket. Fighting for this country.,Knowing that you have to do it to be who you want to be.,
"so I hate the cold so that was bad for me. uh I think what was probably the worst was life saving for me uh I just had I like saving an instructor and I had to grab a big guy like and I kicked him in the groin accidentally and he was not not too comfortable with that um so usually you swim to the otherside of the pool and he meets you half-way and he chased me all the way across the pool and then some so I’m seeing stars by the end of that about to pass out uh whole life saving and just like everyday grind. it started to add up. um on a daily basis it was just like I can’t wait to go to my bed. and then I’d just keep saying in my head the faster you go the faster you’re done. kinda deal so I’d do that for runs um for swims and all those like like earned yourself a little break here and there and that just helped me a lot. um I would do I’m catholic so I’d like pray every night kinda deal. nothing insane, just before I go to bed. no I just like in my head kinda thing. um I would stretch um I would start getting like kina hip pain a little bit so I would have to stretch out my hip spend a little more time at night doing that. and then just hitting the verbal way harder whole friend group was just and like and then my roommate and I back in first and second phase um it was just communal complaining just lets you see a funny side of stuff kinda makes you less angry there’s that so essentially. definitely
","uhh I think the worst thing for me was chest carrying the log, log PT .I don’t know why um its I thought I had a pretty good foundation in strength but that crushed me everytime  .um its kinda looking over and seeing other guys suffer to and seeing someone who is 18 19 I’d say maybe 160 150 pounds and their right there suffering right next to me and try not to repeat six years ago you know what I mean .I did um the boat crew that I had was for the most part solid we had guys in and out but we always tried to win everything so you know being the fastest in the boat being the fasted on the logs so we didn’t have to do the extra PT sometimes we wouldn’t be the best wed always try our hardest but most of the time we did really well so that the uhh the crew that I had would rotate guys out fresh guys in all the time .uh so I do a lot of visualization that’s a big thing for me .sometimes it doesn;t work for people .Ya I learned that here .um I I don’t personally um I probably should honestly.uh for anything physical I try to do uh dynamic warmup.ya exactly ","Monday of hell week. about 24 hours into hell week I was having a pretty rough go I was tired cold and hungry I hadn’t quite got into that lizard brain state yet and one of my best buddies who Id spent the last four months with I knew his family his girlfriend he quit uhh  that kinda rocked me a little bit uhh but then I remember we did a very specific evolution called uhh base tour it's this savage like long run with boats on head and it was one of the hardest things of BUDS. That actually kinda kick started me into feeling I was down in the dumps and we did that evolution and I was like hell yea like this is exactly I deserve to be here I belong here and for the rest of hell week I knew I was gonna get through it, it was just that one one crazy evolution that got me through that. that pain and that suffering pushed me into that primal state.  and I was pumped about it. ya. I felt like it was a journey that we were all in together but at the same time it’s your own path, the hell week battle it's it’s a big internal battle with yourself as well. You obviously have to rely on the support of the guys around you but there has to be something inside of you that gets through it, you control your fate. I could've chosen anytime to quit or I could've chosen anytime to push through it. You gotta chose it. honestly I don’t do much of that stuff. we learned a bunch of mental toughness techniques uhh for hell week but I think umm ya I mean there was a visualization and I used a lot of that for more technical skill type stuff for example we had this stuff in phase two called OC8. it's a very technical test. I did a lot of visualization at home to get the procedures down right. But as far as Mental toughness you just kinda its hard to put a finger on it I just didn’t quit. yea its like chair flying you know the whole going to your happy place and stuff like that didn’t work for me Id go to my happy place and get hit by a wave. and get knocked out of it, it didn’t do much. ","I guess the most the most challenging thing is probably when uh I guess it was kinda lose focus and looking at the big picture instead of focusing on individual tasks that you were doing, like during hell week if it was Sunday night of hell week you were like Jesus I have five more days of this I don’t know if I can do that, that’s when you have to recognize that negative small talk and sort of look at the small picture for me i guess during hell week i can kinda remember um focusing on uh you know one step at a time rather than looking at the big picture and even when you finish hell week and think about everything else you have to do it’s still kinda overwhelming it's kinda just one step at a time getting through OC8, getting through your pistol qual, getting through your rifle qual.   so. ya. ya my buddy, I didn’t want him to get through and I didn’t get through I didn’t want to have to tell my family that I quit. um that was probably the main thing was embarrassing my family most of all and having to put my helmet on the grinder. and having my name out there. ya it’s competition. that’s kinda more of a the that's part of it definitely. ya definitely definitely. yes I do pray. um stretching not so much. so like ya I guess this was more of a second diving thing but visualization. definitely is huge probably the most important thing. ya um visualization. ",probably the first day of first phase or I’d say that um the the the uh first it’s like uh barracks inspections.  that was ya. uh just telling myself not to be like uh just the idea of having to call my parents after that and my brothers and stuff and just telling myself I wasn’t soft thats it. yes uh I well what would that be considered. uh. no like so. it’s more like don’t be like. ya be weak. um. yes and I think that uh what motivated me so being with the same group of guys that came out from the academy with here. like being with them every day helped a lot like seeing them go through the same stuff not wanting to let them down kinda thing. pretty much not wanting to let them down was probably the biggest motivation piece. other then just like getting. no other than just like preparing before and working out and stuff nothing specific on that one.  ,I hated the uh the uniform inspections the most cause I was like probably gonna fail and uh that was just like a shot to the heart cause you would spend so much time and you just ya I didn’t like those but all the physical stuff was particularly bad and like we went through like a summer class so it wasn’t like that cold so you gotta get to the guys who are going through first phase now it’s really cold. but no I thought uniform I hated that stuff cause you spent so much time. like the uniform inspections specifically. I think like the legacy like there's never been a navy lacrosse player to quit buds so I wasn't gonna be the first apparently uh there's more like asterisks but it's kinda like medical type thing um so like um so like as I was told before going in so like you don’t wanna be. that guy right then um one of my classmates uh told me this one thing uh it’s like you so when you quit you put your helmet on the grinder right so your your name is on the ground so. so your putting your name like down in the dirt. and I’m like I’m not gonna let that. I don’t want like your name to be associated with a quitter. ya which gets put on the grinder and everyone walks by they are like dang they are literally looking down at it right. it's like a symbolic thing for me and I’m not gonna let that happen. I’m not really religious but I pray ummm. I would like eat sing and get breakfast every morning. every morning I had a frosted mini wheats and watermelon. and watermelon and I had a good day one day like the first day so I was like this must be the reason why.. and so I like every day that we had breakfast in buds I had a and besides that i don't know I’m pretty ritualistic or superstitious oh like like uh I wore like I wore like the same shirt a lot or like uh someone had a good idea was like every not first phase in first phase I got fifteen shirts right because they were work days and I’d just throw white shirt out at the end of the day and I’d start each day with a. fresh white shirt.. just stuff like that i guess but like by uh like in second phase you have all the pool comp stuff so I’d wear the same brown shirt everyday till I like failed and then switch it and start a new one and then in third phase which sounds gross but I mean it is kinda gross and. but then in third phase I did that same thing too it’s like I’d pass one qual and I’d just keep wearing the same shirt till I passed the next one and then changed eventually but things were going good so if it ain’t broke don’t fix it right. ,"You know I always thought that I would think about that um so the CS gas on the island sucked, that was terrible. um that like that that’s just terrible. that was so terrible. so what’d you ya mean you’re in third phase on the island and you know you’re gonna take it, that’s just the way it is, it’s theres. no alternative. 100% I actually felt held down by a couple of my buddies like just cause you know you got your arms stuck together. that was that was rough um friday morning, err early friday morning at like four five a.m. of Hell week was like I was cold I was like I was. Friday. Early Friday like five o’clock in the morning, when the suns about to come up but it’s still not up, it’s just like you’ve been at it all week and I was just like there was I was just quitting wasn’t even on the table, it was just like just was you’re like I don’t know your body just, they told us to hit the surf and I was just so infuriated because we’re already so like whatever anyways you hit the surf and it’s freezing and I came up and I’m like, you ever seen the scene in like wolverine just like grrrrrr that’s how I was, I was just pissed like that sucked but it was also funny every everything is awesome hindsight, once it’s all done it’s all fun and funny and it’s great but I remember like looking at my buddy and i’m like on a boat and he’s on a boat and I’m looking at him and we’re sarcastically doing it but we’re like acting like cause it’s friday of hell week you know and nobodies gonna quit.. that sucked. ya I practice (unintelligible) uh visualization is huge. visualization if you like that helped me so much just just going through the event like whatever we were doing in my brain first and you know it also ensured that you actually knew what you were doing because if you are like visualizing something and then you’re like hey what’s this like you don’t know what it means so you can study up on it more and then come back visualize visualize and just do runs like that cause there was times on the island where we were doing runs with weapons and it’s like I don’t really know what the hell’s going on and then you visualize visualize visualize it and your still like oh I don’t know what’s happening and then their like go and then you just do exactly what you just visualized, it’s just crazy and per per as well for sure. whenever whenever it’s something cause you know those times where you feel overwhelmed 100% and it’s like hey man ah you know you put this on my heart to do this so whatever you want to happen, that’s cool you know whatever your will is that’s great and he’s he’s been super supportive the whole time..... I think he’s really been helping a lot.. ","Ah well I got rolled in um OC-5, uh, that was the first time, I have never felt anything and I swear on my lung nothing in BUDS compared to OC-5 and I failed it three times in a row. Three attempts then I got rolled OC-5 is um buddy um ditch and dawn your gear underwater. I had three little procedures messed up and that was the best thing that has ever happened to me before. Because I absolutely love this class it kinda humbled me a little bit I mean I was passing the former (intelligible) I got rolled and it was kinda getting to love these guys, I wouldn’t change it for the world. Um, well one you’re here for a goal and I’ll do whatever it takes to accomplish a goal, and two its just, you know, I feel like, when, again, playing baseball learning how to fail, it’s just a part of it, part of the process. If you haven’t noticed, theres probably like 20 of us, and this class had like 59 that are in 338 so having that part of group of friends come in and is just kinda you know 59 originals coming in is a small group so its very easy to mesh. Um, I feel like when we got gassed on the island that was a mental stay in it, stay in the fight, stay in the fight, other than that it was just you take something and you just do it. That was that was something I feel like that is all individual. I mean as a group, we got grouped, we got gassed as a group as a class, but as far as individual I feel like everybody had their own mental fight. It was the worst evolution in BUDS. It was simulated death.","All that stuff's challenging, certainly. But I think for me, so I was, uh, originally three, four, and then I got rolled in hell week, for a couple of injuries... and I think kind of making the decision to stay mentally in the game and come back with the class that I ended up coming back with three three seven. That was a very difficult decision because I'd been pretty much all the way through first phase, gone through, you know, a really challenging selection and realizing that I was going to have to start back. They won and no one cared about what I had already finished. That was really hard. Already having seen behind the curtain knowing that all that was coming. I think just the resolution I had already made that this is where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. I was I was still willing to do whatever I had to do to make it. But it was not an easy thing to accept. Yes. Yes, myself and I told my family I was doing this. My reputation is really important. I didn't want to be telling my parents saying, you know, it's too hard.
","I don't know if I can really narrow it down to a specific evolution. All of it's difficult. It's getting cold. It's definitely a mental challenge. But if there were no rules, I think the most challenging part is to... Always, always keep your self-confidence up. Never let that nagging thought of am I doing good for it? ""Am I... am I doing well enough for the team?"" to not creep in, even if you're doing perfectly fine. That was something I always get in my head is ""am I hurting people?"" I never came to the conclusion that I was always, I was always thinking about that because I didn't want to hold anyone back, or be a liability. So that was always kind of a treat on my mind. Oh, the dedication to wanting to be here, I guess. I mean... Sure. I mean, I know I'm not one of the.... Division one athletes in the class, but uh... it really boils down to how much you want it, how committed you are to being here. Nothing else matters. If you wanted to do- well for most guys it's you want to do- how badly do you want your job, how badly do you want it? So it's really just boils down to your self-confidence and self... Your desire i guess to be part of and willing to serve this community. So I know it's not going to be- it's going to there's going to be harder times, that what were put through here, so there's never going to get easier. You kind of have to accept that its our job to get through this. And that's going to be way easier than the....
","I think it was overall just being doubtful of... my ability to do so. You know, you're surrounded by so many incredible athletes, incredible driven people. That was kind of a thought of... You know, if you see guys quit, you thought were absolute studs and like, okay, these guys can't make it. Will I be able to? So I think that just like on a day to day basis, like, hey, you're going to get up and you're gonna do this to the best you can and whatever happens, happens. But I think this mental aspect is is by far the most challenging part physically. Everyone can do it, but mentally is where it separates who does and who succeeds and fails.","I failed pool comp my first time. And it was challenging because I thought I was comfortable in the water. But I had to get into like another level of comfortability and for me that was just relaxing. I feel like in this program you're taught to really very upright, very hard, but and that instances like hey you just need to relax, like hey you're completely fine just calm down and that's hard for me to like just chill out. I used visualization. I hated failing and I was embarrassed. Yeah well, all they dudes are really helpful and encouraging. How can we help you? Sounds cool to see. Um yeah. One thing you can practice the diving on the grinder. They call it dirt diving. So I think anything too too challenging that we had to face certainly its organized chaos but I wouldn't say anything too too crazy.","Commitment at BUD/S? Oh. um, breaking my foot and having to do hell week knowing that I had a broken foot was, was a doozy. um, but sure better than repeating it all. So. I would say that was hard. Uh, family, I mean I've lived a pretty privileged life and I've had a lot of opportunities afforded to me. Just wanted to, be able to know that, give back and that it's not about me type of deal. And know that there's kids around the world who have absolutely nothing.and, Just pretty easy to stop thinking about yourself. This is gonna be tangential, but I guess I’m going down this rabbithole. um, yeah, and then obviously within the psyche of the individual, and overcoming all these different desires in order to better understand yourself, and I think that relation to knowing who you ought to be, uh, is important then removing yourself from the physical equation. And learning whether or not that is actually true, and this place is an excellent environment to learn just that. Um, I guess in a different note, for a different answer. I mean obviously I thought about that, but.","I’d say, um, just the, uh, relentlessness of it. Um, there was times in first phase when I’d, where we’d have an extremely hard day, and I’d be like, well there’s no way that it could be that hard the next day. It was. So. I’d say that was probably the biggest thing for me. Um, say just keeping a positive attitude. There was no, like, specific thing I would do. Anything like, anything I would say to myself in my head. I don’t know I just kind of did it. And, just kept going. Definitely in-, I'd say both. Internal and, um, being around everybody. Knowing that you're going through the same pain is, um, good. No, I didn't do a whole lot of stretching. I'm not very religious. Um, I mean, for me I was just always at, at the end of the day, just ordering a pizza from Dominos. That was my big thing, so. Um, I’d say, just thinking about my family. I couldn't...just letting them down was probably the one thing I thought about, um. Other than that, no.","Uh so on paper, the most challenging thing that I thought at BUDS is pistol qualification. I failed it twice. I then barely passed the third time. Um but I said the most difficult thing was Hell Week. Basic physiology. I still haven't found a world character. So a big motivator in BUDS is is uh a part for me at least is the fear of failure over want for success? Because if you get rolled, you can lose all your friends. Especially with pistol, you literally you literally go home eight or nine days before you finish. Which would suck. Um...so yeah, I'd say that's a big one. Losing your friends, I think was the worst thing and having to for me at least really go into the class, have to see, you know, it would be fun to meet a bunch of people, but like also you really, really bummed to see your friends go on. I think. Yeah, I think uh that might be one of the subconscious things. But I was like, I'm not...I don't understand what like I never like I was never going to quit. But it like it wasn't like that. You know, reality was I wasn't aware of that reality.","Um, probably being away from my wife. That was one of them. And um, Other than that, I mean, it’s hard, but I mean, I feel like I was able to handle it pretty well. Uh, yes, no, definitely. She, she definitely helped me out a lot. Um, say, I've known her for so long, she’s always been around, and um, just being away, you know, was kind of tough. I've only seen here a handful of times in the last year. Yeah, she definitely helped me a lot. Cause, you know. Uh, I would say a few different things, um, especially going into hell week. Uh, Definitely could not call my wife and tell her I quit, so I just wasn't going to do that. And then my, i would say my dad. There was no way I could, you know, let him down. Uh, not really. Um, but I would say almost all of it is mental. Um, anyone can, can train and get to where they need to be, physically, to pass all the, you know, evolutions and whatnot. But it really comes down to either you want to do this or you don't. That's really all it is. I think a lot of people seem to forget, you know, being a SEAL isn't, you know, boats and logs and hell week, its, um, not that forever, there's an end to all of it, and then, you know, you start doing stuff that you'll end up using in the job.","For me it was definitely the grind like umm going from like a high school setting where yeah I have to wake up early and study for a certain essay or test and coming here umm getting your butt kicked everyday and umm and then if someone would ask me the hardest thing for me It’d be like Hellweek. Hellweek was definitely really tough umm its like for me like normal days during first phase you wake up umm and like at the end of the day you get to be like yeah I get to take a warm shower and eat a lot of food and then Hellweek is just like I’m staying here until like I finish umm like Tuesday night you’re like umm you’re shivering umm like I can’t feel my feet anymore umm I’m chaffing umm I’m so tired I can’t really stand up and you’re just like oh my god I just gotta keep going like umm. Umm definitely like umm having just like grit like definitely frew up playing sports that need a lot of grit like wrestling umm requires a lot of heart. And my family umm my dad my mom umm i feel like umm growing up in this kinda environment umm I couldn’t come home if I wouldn’t umm succeed. Umm I felt like uhh I couldn’t see my famly again if I failed umm. Like uhh the guys uhh I definitely couldn’t have made it through without em like certain people here especially from coming from and being young during this experience and some of these guys umm are 10, 12 years older than me and having so much more experience they defi italy helped me out. I couldn’t umm have done uhh be where I’m at without. Umm I’m catholic uhh I prayed a lot umm uhh there were moments during Hellweek and even in the Island where I where I thought there was no way I imma fail something like a testgate or Hellweek I, I look up to God and prayed to Him, He uhh definitely feel like it helped me through a lot of hard times even like getting getting to Bootcamp or getting through that rough patch after high school to get here umm I definitely do have a lot of faith. That definitely helped me out.","Yeah, I wouldn’t say any single thing was terrible, for me it would just be like just the grind, just waking up on a Wednesday or whatever knowing that you’re going to have to go out and give 100% again that day and you’re super super tired um I would just say getting yourself out of bed in the morning … once you get the day going it wasn’t actually that bad … um but that was actually one of the good things about Hell Week. You didn’t deal with like having to wake up every day and being and like being in your warm comfortable bed you know um ... yeah I would say that was the one thing that was the hardest for me. Getting rolled sucked too. Umm just having to watch all of my good buddies go on with training and I have to sit back for seven weeks for one tread is what we failed, what we got rolled for. That was pretty tough at first but it ended up being one of the best things to happen to me. It was definitely a positive. Um well first of all I got lucky because the other eight guys who got rolled with me I am pretty good buddies with so being with them was huge um the guys in this class are awesome I love class 339 um … what else … just having that time to kinda grow and um it was right after Hell Week so it gave me some time to relax and rejuvenate myself metnally and physically and then you know take a step and see what I can work on and get better um you know and I figured if I have seven weeks off I’m not going to waste my time I’m going to try to come back a better BUD/S student. Um and in the long run it definitely, after I came back from that I had no issues, I hardly failed anything at all so I definitely think it was a positive thing. Nothing big really you know I tried to take care of my body during First Phase I could have stretched more, I would go get massages on the weekend sometimes … um as far as mentally I just tried I just tried to get as much sleep as I could. On the weekends a lot of times um a lot of times they would have guys in the barracks that you could pay that would shine your boots. I would always pay someone to shine my boots um … yeah I just tried to take care of my body get as much sleep as you can. You know you would see guys throughout the pipeline who were getting sick were hardly ever making it. They would get rolled or they would quit because they were always getting rolled. So that was a big thing for me I just wanted to keep my body healthy for as long as I could because you would see guys get rolled and the second time they would go through they just don’t have it in them anymore.","Uh. For me it was logs, I hated logs. Um. They just they just sucked. Um yea lot of lot of pain. Yup. I just knew that um if I just stopped doing logs (unintelligible) that would be like I quit and I knew I wasn’t going to quit um uh something uh one of my friends who was a team guy uh said to me before I came out here, we had lunch, uh he’s like no matter how much it sucks or how much it hurts just know like in the end it’s all worth it, so I kinda just kept that in mind um just kinda dealt with the pain then again I also just looked out for the other guys in the boat crew. And that helped. Yup definitely. Yea yea. Big time yea. Uh this uh a lot of guys definitely, I-I’ve been under a log or a boat with a lot of great guys um but I’ve also had really some turds. Um. Yea I’d say so. ","The gas. It was that I couldn't breathe that I couldn't run away, no but uh I don't know. I guess I didn't really have to think about it. I was just going to be there. It's not like I didn't have to think, like, OK, we're going to stay like it's. Everything else you can kinda just do but that's like something that we've never been exposed to. It was weird to go through something in here like something that'll make grown men scream in pain. Yeah, I had no like second thoughts. Like think it's something I can do just another thing. OC-8. I mean, getting rolled for that, definitely like there is a couple times, where I was like ok, can I do this? Yeah that I was kind of a little bump. Definitely just taking the time to just put in work like hours of dirt diving. Through all these possible situations and then going into it confident. Cause it's really easy to be like I got rolled for this. This could send me home very easily. Just being confident when, you know there's no reason to be confident.",… I would say First Phase daily grind. It’s not one evolution that gets people but uh … First Phase it’s just five days a week you’re getting destroyed and uh guys think too far ahead. Like I said it’s not one evolution that gets somebody its thinking too far ahead you know they’re not taking it one step at a time. I had my own motivation that I knew I needed to make it through BUD/S. Um I took a step back to look at the bigger picture uh there were guys who had been rolled who had been to Hell Week and had been sent back to BO and I’m here already in Third Phase so it kind of makes you appreciate you know what’s… it’s just seven weeks of your life. It’s not that long it’s not a big deal. What motivated me to get through was its not that big of a deal. You know its stupid things but it’s not that big of a deal. A Third Phase roll it’s not that bad. There are much worse things if you get rolled all the way back. … um … spiritual I would say so. That’s part of the reason why I’m here and why I didn’t get hurt you know that’s … sometimes people say that BUD/S is just about getting lucky and not getting hurt. I wouldn’t say it’s luck I would say … I wouldn’t say I was more protected than others but I think I had someone watching over me. There were some things that I could have very easily gotten hurt on but somehow someway I didn’t. Physical … yeah I think we all workout I think we’re all in pretty good shape because you know just to get into First Phase we’re far surpassing numbers for O-Course and for runs. You know for me it was uh the second I think the times were getting tough I think I missed that evolution uh knowing that it’s not going to last that long I know everything is regulated … I know they’re not going to do something stupid to where … as it went on it became more relaxed and I think that changed our perspective on the weeks. Two and a half hard weeks of first phase and then things start to taper off and then you go through Hell Week. Then after that things get a lot smoother so it was just putting it in perspective that I can make it through the 2.5 weeks … so it was just segmenting. Especially in Hell Week I really segmented the days.,"Uh just the every day you got to wake up and you know its not going to be fun but you got to get through it but everyone else has got to do it too. You find guys who you work with who are you know your same height and in the same boat crew with them and they’re guys who want to be here too and you just push each other and just joke around when you can and it just makes the day go by a little bit faster. No I would say that I was kind of like the younger brother who is easy to talk to, you know the older guys can be a little scary to talk to but I’m just easy to talk to and you know I have a lot to learn too so they just come and coach and teach too.Um didn’t do anything physically besides just trying to eat more calories just try to think about what I didn’t do good at what I need to do better. Um sometimes I would pray a little bit here and there, but not on a regular basis.","Oo... I would say just the grind. It didn’t really matter what Phase you were in either. So like First Phase obviously you’re getting beaten down just with the physical and metnal aspect of it but then even when that day is done you know that day will end you have to go back and clean all your gear for the next day and wake up super early and you know that even though you are sore and tired you have to willingly wake up and face these instructors that you know will destroy you again. So I think it’s just that constant wake up, get destroyed, go to sleep, sore, tired, wake up, and then it’s the same thing in Second Phase with disciplinary actions so you’re still getting wet and sandy so even though you made it past all that stuff in First Phase you think it would start to get easier but it doesn’t. And now you’re diving so you still have all that stuff but now you’re exhausted from diving. And then the island obviously you’re out working every single day and even the weekends you’re still waking up super early. So I guess its just the mental grind. Uh practice maybe I guess it depends on growing up or how you grew up so maybe people who weren’t exposed to sports or weren’t exposed to that grinding aspect … I don’t know. I mean I just worked my ass off every single day … and I mean I didn’t have someone there so no one made me do it so I guess just the willing to do it myself and I guess just like the I can do it myself. You know with sports the coaches make you do it but it’s that off time I think that’s where you make your money. I think everyone is pretty much on the same page I mean you definitely have your outcasts but I don’t think those people are here anymore and I couldn’t tell you why they’re outcasts but pretty much everyone here is similar I mean we’re all meatheads in the gym and we’re all pretty stubborn when it comes to being told you’re not doing something so at first I was a little nervous about that thinking there may be too many cooks in the kitchen but I think it was the complete opposite you know because I think everyone is so willing to help everyone out because we’re all so similar minded and we all have the same goals and it’s not like I want to be here and have to compete against you it’s more like we’re all here so let’s help each other out and make each other better and see how great we can become as a team? Um… like religious factors? I would say my number one go to whenever it got tough was dad. That was number one every single time, no doubt that was on my mind.","Probably the water. Probably water just because, like, that's one thing- I like definitely swam and stuff growing up. But I didn't swim competitively. I was never like... Like I just swam for fun... and not necessarily swimming portion, but especially like underwater stuff. It's just like- I didn't have much experience with. So it was like kind of weird at first. I guess just my nerves. Not really scary, but like, I'm just nervous. I don't know. Really just stand in the moment and just kind of attacking it and, just kinda- once it, once I start anything that I'm really like. ""Stressful situation."" I just have a way of kind of like going into like a focused mode where I was just like me doing what I need to do. And it's not- I don't like outsiders stressors kind of get in. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Like everything you do here is like everybody's gone through it with me. You guys like you're never like alone do anything here.","Um I think the uh I think running um just cause like like uh like before I came here like I wasn’t like nearly as well trained as most the other guys that come here, like the dudes that come here are absolute animals and I was not that um so I think like running because physically like I was not good at it, definitely one of the worst runners and then mentally um everyday like when you had a 4 mile it was like like I selling my soul for that 4 mile like it was like at a huge put out and the whole rest of that day would just be like me recovering from doing that 4 mile so I think like the hardest part of BUDS was like the like slick 4 mile runs was the worst part","Yeah, I think for me it uh would have been second phase, OC-8 test. Because I went… uh to my third attempt on that. So that was probably the hardest part of BUD/S. Um...and then… I think it was just I hadn't had the procedures down uh flat and so my first test was kind of rough. The second test went a lot better. Still failed that one. So then the third test, I finally got it. But um...yeah, more procedural based on that one. Um...on the island, just working all day, every day. That was a grind.","Yeah, Hell Week’s just, just a grind. There’s nothing that stands out as like this one thing was impossible. But you just have your, your moments that are just like you just kinda get through em.  It was just, just like a men, a mentality to just keep going knowing that everything is going to end eventually. Uhm, definitely seeing like just going through whatever we’re doing just take care of that one step at a time. ","I don’t know I’d say the hardest part was just getting back but uh I’d say during like physical or just overall? I’d say just the grind but uh. Yeah but it’s not really that it really wasn’t that bad I’d say, not a contributing factor but it never made me consider not continuing, I’d say the hardest part was just getting back. Umm I guess before I even start with getting back, I guess there wasn’t even an option of quitting, so like probably the only way I was getting out was my performance or like injuries, just had that expectation that it’s going to get worse or something worse is going to happen so it’s not that bad. Um I would say just having a light attitude and just not really caring too much about like nothing too far ahead and just living in the present, really just staying relaxed, I think just during the training or even ater, staying relaxed and enjoying the training when I’m off. Oh yeah exactly, the small things just to enjoy it. ","I mean technically for me it was shooting. That was the first time where I really struggled with any evolution, and not getting feedback from instructors and not really clicking at first that was the most frustrating. I guess, for me, I got cellulitis in both of my legs after Hell Week, and there was a good week or so I thought I was going to medically drop from the class. And that was probably the most stressful time I knew it was out of my control. I didn't want to, I had just been through Hell Week with these guys, and I was afraid I was just gonna go on alone. Everyone was always encouraging me even when I had to sit out through the rehab sessions. The small steps I make in improvement people would make a big deal out of them and would encourage me. Especially like my boat crew, the guys who were with me. For BUD/S, I'd always try to give half an hour every night. Where even if it meant giving up sleep. I'd just kind of sit down or lie down or whatever and just not do anything. Kind of think about the day. Yeah, I'd say almost every night, I'd try to fit in time for that. ","Working with the pistol. I can't see very well out of my right eye. It was hard to move fast and you can't really fake a pistol shoot. And I guess I can, I mean, I'm here. I knew how to pass the test, and I did what I neede to do. I read a couple of pages of a book before I go to sleep every night. Like before I go to sleep every night, I think helps like reset you and reminds you what happens in BUD/S and in life doesn't suck. I read mostly girly love stories or athletic achievement books like perform in the mile and stuff. ","I started in 36. I have had some medical issues in my back, and that caught up to me as I got rolled before Hell Week in week three. So the toughest time was I was never going to make a decision on my own to stop. I just didn't do a good job of managing my back issue the first time. I have to stretch a lot. So my performance dropped off a lot. And it was another one of those experiences I had getting cut from the big boy football team. That happened and I was like, out of the class getting rolled, and I was just like, I didn't see this coming, it wasn't part of the plan. So I was just like lost. So that was definitely the toughest part, again I just put one foot in front of the other. Start to collect myself. Medical didn't tell me very good stuff and whatnot. I guess I'm here now. And it really was just like, one foot in front of the other. I'm not going to make the decision. I think the class did like me a lot. I had the respect from the instructors as well. Seemed like at least. Which helped me at the end of the day, I thought. Because my performance completely dropped off. So I definitely felt a hundred percent welcome by my class from a lot of these guys out here. And that, that whole family is reminding me. Hey, I'm not going to make this decision. So physically, at least second time through, I just stretched everyday. But mentally, it's not natural for me, but I tried to journal. I wouldn't say, I haven't done it on a regular basis, but regardless, at the end of every day usually while stretching I try to meditate a little bit. Try to reflect, look back at the day. Pray a little bit and try to set myself outside of the moment.","The instructors. The student-instructor relationship is a hard one to navigate. Because they are the gatekeepers. And in their eyes, you know nothing. You're just a pawn in the world. I have to get through them to achieve my goals. Nothing. Nothing I would do over and over again. ",,
"tough in like. nothing nothing monumental like or earth shattering stuff but there’d be times when you're running on skill and jump in the ocean but since you’re already wet you don’t need to cause they won’t notice kinda thing umm and and you would get back faster and it paid if you got back faste they’d be like ok you guys go you’re good and keep the slower guys so there was kinda that. right ya. umm well the first time the round we were in BO um I like did did the whole I’m already wet I can turn around. um and then kinda thought about it and then some of our friends were like hey man you you didn’t even do it not the second time we’re already wet just gotta do it. so I just thought about that and stopped and then um ya just the the knowing that as it comes as we used to say as an officer or whatever people are still looking at you so kinda keep it good professional 
","umm so ya there there’s a tough one um one of my friends when i was in my original class he was in my boat and we were in hell week and he was super beat up basically more beat up then the rest like physically beat up and we weren’t as fast as we could have been and we were kinda holding back for him and I basically told the boat crew we’re not gonna run him out just cause a lot of that was on me and I didn’t want to see this guy that I worked with for six years get sent home for something that you know at the end of the day doesn’t really matter ya you can I don’t know, he’s physically capable of being an excellent operator but he just had a bad luck bad draw card  .right so I basically made the executive decision that we were not gonna run this guy out of the crew . ya .the big picture was i’ll take the beatings just as long as he doesn’t leave.ya exactly and I know for a fact that he would have done the same for and the whole boat crew was on board and the whole boat crew thought he was a good guy and it was the end of hell week it was like Thursday morning or thursday afternoon so we knew he wasn’t gonna quit so .just gotta pull the reins back a little bit
","ya the thing about BUD/s is you don’t have a lot of autonomy, every decision you make is pretty much made for you especially throughout you know first phase definitely, second phase third phase a little more autonomy. I would say like a difficult decision if you can go back to hell week that monday night it was the decision of do I stay doing this being in pain hurt and tired then you know for the first and only time in training that I had a second weighed options you know I was like shit if I quit what do I tell my family and those thoughts had never crossed my mind in this pipeline and it was only ten minutes and I was I was challenged and you know you make the decision then and there I’m not gonna let this decision get in my way you know I'm gonna power through it, that was really the only decision you make at BUD/s. Ya I mean there is simple like you know do I go to safety on a pier but just basic day to day decision but not like big life changing decisions that was probably one of them. Ya I mean you always know its in the back of your head but it was a full frontal head on collision that I needed to make this decision right now kinda thing
",um let’s see uh how is it going to affect people around me so is that is this more like a tactical decision. ya so BUD/s you are mostly told what to do. and you kinda do what you are told it’s kinda once you get out to the island you start making decisions like on your own like I mean decisions putting obviously but decisions the decisions to cut corners right or something like that take the easy way out instead of the decision to do something where you could cut a corner it’s more of like is this gonna make somebody else's day harder I guess i mean that;s probably what most people will say here that they hold they hold their classmates in very high regard and they don’t want to do something to uh kinda have these guys look down on you I mean they say you are constantly being evaluated even if the instructors aren’t there. we’re evaluating each other on something. ,uh I got really nothing sorry. I do not have any tattoos um but yes I would say impulsive I guess uh I’m just. no no i am. sort of. no. spontaneous I guess ya just kinda if someone says their doing something randomly i’d be like ok ya.  ya. go and straight. oh ya alright probably not like super. I can’t really think it’s kinda all just a blur. ,ya. um. I think like the peer ranking were difficult decisions I actually did make one there was a guy in my uh I’m not sure if I did the right thing or not but there was a really young guy in our in our group group he was like 19 fresh out of high school he was an absolute stud of a performer but like super immature like uh we told him that before and it’s kinda getting out of hand with like talking saying things at inappropriate times like he’ll make really really bad and I was his fireteam leader and I put him in my bottom five and I wrote in there I don't think he’s a bad performer and I think he should be here but I think he needs to have a tough conversation about maturity right but then like everyone knows who the bottom five are right and I was talking to one of the instructors he came up and I talked out it and kinda publicly shamed the guy when I coulda taken more of a mentor role and so that’ll be a tough decision that I made that didn’t end up working out and made me kinda like ok maybe I shoulda tried harder but here is one way in buds when I coulda been an officer so after that I shifted tried to be more of a mentor role cause I was like six years older than the guy and it ended up working out. use the box. yes when and I put the disclaimer in there like hey I don;t think he’s a bad performer but ya so that would be a tough decision I made that ended up teaching me something about like that peer relationships or something that you can do rather than publicly shame somebody. um I didn’t feel comfortable going up to the instructors saying hey can you go and talk to this guy. the I realized that would have been much much better than just like writing a little blurb on the hey I don’t think he's actually that bad you know um. so I think that would have been so that's where I learned like maybe I think I was hiding behind it a little bit cause I didn't really know exactly what to do so I chose the easy the less comfortable option. ,"well I guess when you said with any decision you make you’re thinking about how it’s gonna relate to all the other guys um how it’s gonna affect others. ya like if you know you’re trying to, like let’s say you’re gettin beat they tell you to shutup don’t say a word just take ok that’s great but in my mind I’m always like what happens if I start yelling like what happens if like instead of keeping quiet I’m just gonna start counting loud cause what are they gonna do you know you’re just getting the boys fired up it makes everything way easier and they don’t like you being motivated at the end of it they just beat us more but we’re it’s gonna be even easier. So like you think about, I always thought about that uhh should I should I and then I always do, you know so whatever. you know thinking about how it like affects others, then it’s like hopefully the guys understand if that’s not what the instructors actually want.... hopefully they get it but. what. ya of course. if they don’t then we get the blame anyway.. ","None that I can recall. I know one of my good friends quit (inaudible) in first phase, he was rosining the log and I tried to get him not to quit but he ended up quitting but that’s like the only","Yeah, there's a couple couple of difficult points... There's a good friend of mine and first phase who we ran out of our boat. Really liked him as a person. But uh, you know, wasn't... wasn't able to keep up and other guys in the boat was saying some really negative things to him. And I didn't feel like the words they were saying were really reflective of who he was and what he had shown us about himself, up until that point. But the fact of the matter is, he was born this way. So I didn't personally say anything negative to him, but it was really difficult to see him take that negativity from the other guys in the crew. There's a performance standard and at a certain- most of the time we'll try to help one another. You know, you're lacking in one area, but at a certain point, you see a guy give up on himself. And if you can't help him bring himself to the standard and he's given up on himself and he's done up here, we recognize that in him. And I can see that he was he was out. You have to recognize that everyone else in the boat is pulling their weight.So you don’t want them to get hurt.
","That was a difficult decision was definitely medical, I got rolled in second base. It's okay, especially after I was well, the first time those nagging me on my head but like, ""Oh I might get dropped for this."". I knew if I had continued, it probably would have been extremely dangerous to my health if I hadn't gone. I could've, essentially like, like extreme risk for ...
","Running classmates out was a big one. You know, I like them as a person? But, if they were going to be a liability and cause of injury to myself or the guys who were putting out and performing, then, yes, it's always tough to see that. But in the end, you're going to make a decision that's going to be good for the whole of the class. So if someone wasn't keeping up or wasn't carrying their weight, then... they need to be removed from the program. 
","Yeah, there was a kid in my original class after Hell Week we decided he couldn't get up on the obsticals. And he decided to go around. And then worded in that he passed but everone in the class saw. He was a really well liked kid, a really good performer and we eventually turned him in. For me it was a no brainer, he had to go. I was like hey he's a scumbag I don't want him. But like other guys were like no, he's done really well we should keep him it was like a one time mistake. But it was more so challenging arguing that against different peoples moral ethics.","Um, no I, I never had uh, a personal encounter with it. Obviously you hear of other people seeing something. And then, but, not personally, I had to be the actor in that specific sort of thing. So.","Um, nothing, no, nothing huge. No. I’ve actually, one thing I think we did really well as a class was not cutting any corners. Individually, and as a class whole, so.","I think I think I think especially in first face, those decisions are played out in a long in like over a longer period of time rather than like. And I like for example, I really like log PT or like you have a boat in your head and you can kind of get away with, like, not carrying your weight, and nobody will really know. and there was a lot of times where like I really had to consciously be like, really? Because that weight just gets transferred to your friend. So those are like the kind of like the moral issues that I think that that's what really weighs on people. Like if they do quit or if people are quitting is that they like I its that they like I'm at my wit's end. It's just that I can't really carry my weight that much. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. Yeah I mean, so it's called ducking boat. But like when we're like when your friend's head isn't on the boat, that's when it might be. In my opinion, that's like a moral decision. Cause like we got weight that gets transferred to the other people and that like knowingly doing it and you're just avoiding the temporary pain. So to mean that's a moral decision. But to see somebody steal something or I, I'd lie about something like you know, like I can't really remember I guess.","Um, no I never really ran into that, um, and I'm not really sure what I would do, like, you know, just depending on the situation. Um, I’m not sure.","Umm not really that I can recall, but umm like cheating like uhh I can’t really think of anything maybe like uhh I can’t really think of anything like morally a situation here. Emm not that I can remember uhh maybe in like Helweek some guys put padding like on their head like their hat so they don’t lose as much hair uhh I didn’t, uhh I didn't think much of it. I just uhh I just always kinda thought like do the right thing uhh help everybody out, be for the guys.","Difficult decision … um nothing is really popping into my head right now, my class was pretty good at holding each other accountable so we didn’t really run into any big issues for that um yeah you know since I’m not an officer that wasn’t really my place all the time … um for me if there was anything big I would obviously step up and say something but most of the time I would just kinda try to mind my own business and uh try to do the right thing myself and just worry about myself.","I don’t think so..I...think the only hard choice would be quitting and I wasn’t ever going to do that. Um. Um yea I mean that was never fun um but I I don’t think I ever wrote down anything I wouldn’t say to that person’s face um so it wasn’t really a hard decision um I don’t know maybe going to medical when I was screwed up cause I was really worried about getting rolled or dropped um but I know I couldn’t really continue...that sucked . Yea um just uh talking to the other guys and uh seeing what they thought, get a lot of different opinions um and uh just kinda in-the-and doing what I do and what I had to do . ","Yeah, for sure. There's definitely like for a lot of ways that you can cheat here at BUDS like. And it's a lot of things like you have to be the man and be like, OK, I'm going to consciously make a decision not to do that. Like especially like staying out after curfew. I know like, and lying about certain things. Like here's one of the circumstances I'm not gonna name anything in particular. He's still actually in the program. And he had lied to one of the instructions about not having a vehicle when they were doing vehicle inspections. You know, he was my roommate at the time. And so I knew about it. And I did tell him either you're going to, like, say something and he had some contraband hidden in his car so I did like to tell the officers in the class, which I mean, like there's there's a certain point where it's like, okay, are you just kind of protecting the bad guys? Like yeah. You might have made it past Hell Week but or are you just harboring guys? Are you trying to protect those guys? Are you actually trying to do the right thing? Even if they did make it through Hell Week or whatever. I think the hardest thing was like confronting people because I'm such like I'm an easygoing guy. It's hard for me to sometimes talk about things that carry weight.",I can’t really think of anything… Yeah nothing comes to mind.,"Uh it was hard, you think a lot about it and then you ask your friend what would they do. I can’t really think of anything that comes to mind though.",Myself no but one of my good buddies did DOR during Hell Week and we met in boot camp and they just kind of stole my best friend. But we had to have a tough conversation in the middle of Hell Week during chow you know me trying to convince him to not but then his reasons why and just watch him ring the bell after and just that image and he talked about those few months during boot camp and seeing that image that just wasn’t very fun. But other than that no I don’t think that any of my decisions were that tough. Yeah but other than that I don’t think I really had any of those tough decisions … none that I remember.,"Probably. So I guess talking about like running somebody out, just kinda, it's kind of like I tried to give- If we were going to run somebody out, we tried to like, from my experience and we ran anybody out of was more like-  It wasn't as, uhh.... A bunch of guys like yell at people and stuff like that. We never we never really, like, told the guy to get out or just kind of try to be nice to him, like him in like do what you can do. Next thing you know, he's gone. And it's like it was hard, obviously, cause you're like basically running  the guy out, like, grown in his dream. But in the end, this program is not for everybody. And maybe down the road he gets some better shape and comes back and makes it. But if this program was like just uh... like get guys who weren't ready or something like that, then it wouldn't be what it is. I don't know. I guess that's, I kind of didn't really answer your question. Yeah. And everyone's expected uphold them. So if I was not meeting the standard to help him, it's kind of counterintuitive, to the whole program. ","Um yea uh so I wasn’t very big on the whole running people out thing um I-originally when I came through like in 334 like I was like dang that’s like rough um pretty m-mean in my like opinion I thought it was like a very mean thing to do um but in-in 37 we like we did run a couple guys out and it was uh like it wasn’t I don’t-I don’t know why like I think it was for like a uh I think it was more so for morale boost for the guys who were doing well um because like those are the guys you want to keep up and the guys who are like kinda bringing you down you wanna get rid of them so it really doesn’t make sense because even with them not doing well like it makes everything harder because like whatever little weight they’re carrying, they’re still carrying some weight so I think that was just like a like a morale boost for the guys who were doing well so... can you repeat the question again, I’m sorry. Mhm. Oh um I think it was um more so decided by anger of like like hearing guys I can’t keep up or like like like the complaining of like guys I’m hurting when everyone is hurting um which is like like uh a poor attitude you didn’t you didn’t want to be around anymore especially when you’re like sleep deprived and tired and stuff like uh I guess the negativity they were bringing was like what did it for me. Yes, I’d say so","Yeah. Um...mmm...I think like at least in like first phase, like the difficult decisions, I would say, are were more of like I don't, I don't want to quit and look like inferior to my buddies. But, like, I don't know...Yes, that's a, that’s a tough question. A difficult decision that I just try I just always try to think of myself like, don't quit. Um...this sucks right now, like you'll push through. Yeah, I mean uh....No, I don't think so. I've never had to like...never ran a classmate out. But I mean, as far as, like, the evals, things like I don't think that they were too difficult to me just because, like, they're true. I always try to just be truthful in them. But um, as far as difficult decisions, no I can't really think of anything specifically that, that I had to do."," Yeah we definitely had a couple decisions like that. Uh, in terms of class leadership amongst the officers and the senior enlisted guys we have. Uhm, and they always turned into, it wasn’t just me making the decision or just our OIC making the decision it was always like a group discussion about it, uhm, amongst those that have the leadership roles and we always talked it through, so. Uhm, so one example is just a guy breaking curfew on our first weekend. Like going out drinking and comes back and he’s, he’s the only guy that comes back late. So, talked about it with the class to decide are you gonna turn him into the staff or are you gonna handle it within the class. I’ve had a few, a few things like that come up.Uh, you definitely have to. We thought about both fors, uh, I thought about both forsure. Cause if, if you turn this one guy in it’s likely that you’re gonna put him in a really bad spot where if he has a history of other mistakes he’s gonna get dropped from the program likely. So, you definitely take that into consideration. But, uhm, what we kind of saw as the more important thing is what, what the rest of the class is doing and the guys who are doing the right thing. You need to be able to stand up for the guys who are gonna do the right thing and, and get rid of the people who are gonna be toxic to the class.","Yeah I’d say um probably Hell Week where um there’s some people just not carrying their weight and you just gotta push past it and I learned you can try running em out but like you have to keep the pace. You have to keep the pace with like running boats or what not and somebody can’t keep up and it’s just a shitty ass situation. Um I would say based on the person that was, if it was good person from, if he was just having a bad day then yeah obviously you’d try to carry him through that evolution but if it’s like constant like throughout the entire pipeline they’ve been slacking or just being a turd, alright well he’s not contributing he hasn’t been helping with the boat crew, it’s time to just keep pushing through, if you can’t keep up you can’t keep up that kinda deal. Oh yeah our entire boat crew would just push through, go faster. Yep, mainly if they’re like one of those guys that been a problem since day one, kind of just like hanging on. I mean ya uh you know because every single guy that’s here wants to be here and it’s their dream and for the most part they’re they’re 100% committed to the class, the team, and every body else, but sometimes they’re just not at the time physically ready and you know like definitely some of them are still around but it’s just not helping the class. Kind of part of it. ","There is one time where, in the middle of Hell Week, I was one of the giants. And we had been crushing it like pretty much all phase, but there was one person who was definitely the weak link, and he probably could have made it with another boat crew, but he was definitely holding us back, so we ran him out on Tuesday. And I felt pretty bad about that because it was the difference between us winning things and us being in the middle of the pack. And I just felt bad that he got run out. Not necessarily, but because he was weak, he just wasn't good enough for our boat crew.",,"One comes to mind during Hell Week, maybe more of a rational decision. We had just flipped around boat crews. We lost some guys, so I was with a bunch of guys I had never been with at all yet. And one of the guys was struggling. One of the Petty Officers was struggling pretty seriously, it's a chow run. Instructors were yelling at him put him in the two whatever and one of the Petty Officers, his buddy was yelling right back at them, let him stay where he is, and as the Officer I got chewed out for it afterward. So it was maybe more of a lack of decision, but the decision to not do anything. Froze as far as that was happening, and I should be doin something right now, didn't really know what to do. So I gave him a stern talking to, and my instructor was just upset about stepping up. Being a leader, if I'm not going to try to do this because of my back, but it was the decision to try.","No, I think BUD/S is pretty straightforward. Either you do or you don't.",,
"um I think coming from the academy we knew a little more what to expect you are around it more I had pretty good resources um Rick Joslin over in the leadership hall he’s really good at kinda giving us insight. and helping us out um and then I had my family that I reach out to as well. just really good community personal face. which was great. uh and then just going back to the personal traits from whatever I said earlier, um I forgot what I was but I think that helped out. I think again they probably didn’t have the good exposure like knowing what to expect like they show up these big meaty guys and thinking they're gonna throw logs and boats around and it’s a lot of running and stuff and then the daily grind can be is more than just what they account for I think they catch people off guard and the younger guys I’m sure it’s a maturity stand point and they’re more focused on the near and now which like I definitely couldn't do this at 18 so guys that do um just everyday I’m impressed by that um I think the guys sometimes come for like the wrong reasons too like I wanna be cool or whatever or just watched to much movies umm ya I think it;s a big one and  a lot of people just sometimes they hurt themselves and that catches up pretty quick 
","ya ya. um I think a lot of it is luck um in hard work luck, hard work and just the will to like no matter what and just know that this is your last chance at anything here and you set your entire life you know devoted your entire life to make it through and their gonna have to kill you to get you off ya. . they might of had straight up bad luck they could have worked harder, lost that fight, lost that fire like for example bad luck would be broken leg injury or something something that isn’t your kinda out of your hands you know what I mean . ","ya we talked about this alot with the guys around here and our families so I think its gonna sound like a terrible answer but I think a massive part of it is self delusion like tricking yourself into thinking you can do anything. why people no no no why people succeed. right so my theory is like you have to be so good at everything through this pipeline that you gotta be able to run boats for miles on end then you gotta be smart enough to do diving stuff and then safe enough to do gun stuff and no human should really be able to be that good at every single facet of training right your gonna kinda road block at some point during training but if you can trick yourself into training like screw it I can diving I can do gun stuff I can do first phase and hell week and you just telling yourself that absolutely like no doubt in my mind I'm getting through this even if somewhere else statistics are against you and it's gonna such and you’re gonna get through it but if you can trick yourself into saying ya I can do this you can do it, it’s that old quote of those who think they can and those who think they can’t are in both right it’s true, believing in yourself and making sure yourself of making that decision. Does that make sense I know its kinda a weird answer.  ya its confidence in yourself but again the whole like its self confidence but a smart person should realize that that there's no way you can get through all this stuff and learn what you need to learn just if you can trick yourself into thinking you can it tends to work out i don’t know that was my problem but probably not the most uhh political answer but you know. tricking myself into thinking this from the beginning into getting through it is probably how I did it.  ya I think bad attitudes I think they when there was pain and suffering and making jokes they were relying on other guys to pick them up I think they just let that consume them and got bad attitudes about I think um overall physical fitness has a big part in it you know I think there's dudes that just ya I its physical fitness does play a role in it but at the end of the day you still have to carry a boat a long way. So you’re gonna have to some level of strength in order to do that. ya they really weren’t as physically strong as some guys. it's tough training you gotta be able to be physically strong. and the other one is attitude is not uhh physical mental and then I just it was uhh ….unintelligible…..ya I can’t express what exactly what it is I think attitude is a big thing like you choose if you make it through the program or not like a lot of people who don’t make it through or have excuses they their hurt or injured or the day it was cold that day so that's why I didn’t run as fast they throw out bullshit in my opinion like you are the one that decides if you get through or not and you guys even hit on it in your surveys there's like 11 12 questions if I see a roadblock in my way who has control of that and the answer for most the guys here is I have control the example I use is it starts on that 20 percent that make it through training or whatever it is and people are like oh that's terrible how are you gonna make it through its 20 percent the odds aren't 20% it's not like I got a five sided coin and I get lucky you literally control whether you make it through this or not so in my mind you have a 100 percent chance of getting through cause you are the one who decides they don't decide for you. IF you perform and you do what they say and you just get through it you're gonna make it through and its as simple as that. ",maturity I think I I i uh lived on my own since I was 18 moved out went to college graduated got my own place paying bills stuff like that obviously there's some young guys here but they don’t know what it's like to get out on their own they don’t really know what the consequences of what happens if you don’t if you don’t I mean I knew I knew that making it through the program and having to go out to the fleet I knew that how bad that could be and.    and uh I don’t think people realize what the consequences or what can happen if you don’t work hard or you know apply yourself and finish what you start. ummm selfish I think I think they cared more about themselves then the people around them. umm when things got bad things got scary they felt sorry for themselves they didn’t really care how anyone else was feeling or ya. I think they didn’t know how to see the big picture. ,um preparation I think. a big one. coming from the academy I kinda think we have an advantage form the start because compared to the enlisted guys we have all the prior knowledge about it and knowing people that have gone through the same thing beforehand kinda get their experience from it and can learn from that. and then also just I think I’m very not necessarily stubborn but I don’t like if I;m gonna do something I don’t want to quit on it I guess so. uhh not really. ok. ya ya. I think so not like having their heart kind of in it if their just kinda doing it on a whim I think that those like a lot of those guys quit umm some of it’s probably luck but I think most of it is just I think the majority of people that quit they make the decision ahead that they are gonna quit I think it’s more mental than physical. cause all all in around had I think.  for for mentoring.  ,I think I have like a really really strong support system coming from my family friends and then uh guys I was really close with out here like I mean I lived with five other four other O’s who were all in my class so I knew a bunch of dudes I think I had a lot of reasons to be here and I didn't really have another option I think that was it like we were doing this or like going to the fleet like I can’t and not like coming back and I think like I just wanted it for a long time. ok I don;t know I wasn’t but ya I think the support system was huge. ya. ya I think guys didn’t make it but have a plan b um ya I think a lot of people did or or they started looking for them and you have a bad day and it’s not really that bad right something like that right. you know for us it’ll be like you know what would suck right now the bridge you know that would suck you know I’m cold but at least I’m not standing a four hour watch on the the fucking aft you know look out you know what i mean I’d say something like tha but uh. no you kinda hear the same stuff uh oh it's just not for me so I respect the guys that realize that what what is worse is the people who know it’s not for them but don’t want to quit and drag the other guys down I thought that was I had no respect for those guys but the guys who were man enough to just say hey this this is not for me like I’m out like no no ill will towards those guys but ya its the ones who like and like you hear people say some people say I know I’m not performing but I'm not quitting. it’s like you’re you’re old prune but you’re one sixth of this and it’s like it doesn’t matter if you do that in second phase like you you’re by yourself right. first phase its like all team. so its like that pisses me off and then they would get rolled or dropped or whatever but I don't feel bad for them because they aren’t a good teammate. ,"um I’m pretty, I’m average joe physically, um. So somehow my brain likes learning new stuff. and like that’s just what I like so.. ya ya i’d say that, I genuinely enjoyed taking like on the new stuff cause. it’s like hey this something I’ve never done, this is this should be fascinating um also like having having family you know I can call family anytime, anytime I was having troubles just talk to them you know talk to talk to my my girlfriend who is actually really really strong person. so talking to my dad my mom. Absolutely and then also one thing for me which was also I guess I’ll tie into the wall is like you know me like believing in God believing in like the gospel and stuff, like having that network of support, I mean it’s amazing to get the people that come through here. that that don’t have that faith, it’s like you are a very very very strong person you know it’s it’s I nobody’s right or wrong I don’t you know it’s believe in whatever you believe in is fine it’s just like wow you your the strongest I I have to I have to have something you know it’s just the way that my brain works and what I believe so I don’t know. ya people, people who are overly selfish and uh people who are not physically ready. and um. ya ya I mean that there is a standard I never I never had a problem meeting the standard um it’s you know some stuff I did well really well at physically some stuff was a little bit harder but still you gotta meet the standard um but ya there are some exceptional athletes here, that’s why I am average. um. you know they they some guys come in and an they like the idea of it but they never never have any intention of completing it for like actually completing it, it’s super weird you see it all the time like this guy has no idea what this is and he just wanted a taste, it’s just super strange. ya and also I I was very very fortunate thats I was successful because I was super fortunate that I didn’t have injuries, some people had injuries and like that can really tie into their decision making with you know how. difficult different evolution are so I was super super fortunate. yes. I mean I I wouldn’t say that, it just seemed like all the guys made it great like all the guys, it it was just good ya a good situation great situation, I had a great class. and that that was was really fortunate you know cause some classes suck and it makes everything a lot harder........... ","Childhood, umm….Growing up just always being rough or playing backyard football or baseball, ya know just  always training, always getting outdoors, outdoors is huge. And then, uhh, another thing is just the support of my, if you have support that will literally get you through 99% of BUDS. And also just uhh having an edge, I don’t know I feel like just my own personal mentality, I just wanted to succeed. Yes. I feel like, not for everybody, but the majority, when I see people quit I think they were in it for the wrong reasons. You know, the the glamor of being a SEAL I don’t think they really actually wanted to do the work that the job entails.","I think I probably some guys have mentioned sense of humor is important. I think that's a small part of a bigger strategy. I think the reason that I'm still here is just the ability to segment and compartmentalize my mind. I don't think that there's really any evolution in doing this program that every guy who shows up to Coronado could complete. I think, I think everyone who has gotten a contract and made it here could do every evolution from the program. But it's when you start to overwhelm yourself with, ""I'm doing this, which sucks"". And then after this, I know what I'm doing and I know that's hard. And then we have a night evolution, so I'm not going get much sleep tonight. And then tomorrow is a really challenging thing. And you start to just stretch what your mind run away. And those guys end up just quitting on something that, you know, they could easily finish. So I think uh-  So I think I'm still here just because you take things one day at a time and kind of make light of present circumstances.
",,"I think a big part of it was having those mentors and kind of having idea what was coming. So being mentally prepared for it and knowing, you know, it's going to suck for a while, but you can do it because people before you have done it. I think there was a fear- whether that was a fear of failure or fear of of what's to come next rather than, you know, just being in that moment- was the biggest defining factor. Guys would most of the guys that quit, quit before an evolution, not during it, but before it because, it was ""oh I'm scared to do this. This guy is just going to suck."" So I think there was a trend that I saw these in the classes in my class in first phase was if guys were quitting, it was a quiet moment in between an evolution. It's just, you know, asking about the mental aspect. What you have, you know, mentally in your in your headspace, that's really the biggest aspect of it.
","Uh I think I was just really dug in and focused on it but I think there's a good amount of luck that's also involved. I think I had, like other people would say that I'm am lucky cause I had two rolls. think I don't know how you can quantify it. I think, you know prior coming to BUDS whether or not you're going to be successful. I just knew growing up. I was. I knew I was going to graduate and I knew. It was never an issue. It was more so like do I really wanted to do this.","For the reasons I listed above. Helping others, and wanting to learn. And obviously my wierd, maybe tainted, view of the world. Um, just simple desire to forget about yourself. You're not important, you don’t ever deserve a pat on the back. And the people that realize that are able to separate themselves from their, their emotions. I almost feel like their, like prefrontal cortex and amygdala turns off, and they like, start to understand. I would say, like, maybe that's maybe what's happening. Um, I'd say that's probably the biggest thing.","Um, I don't know. Just being quiet, putting my head down, doing what I’m told. Um, because, what, I mean, everyone has their different ways of approaching it. I definitely uh, my thing was just being quiet, putting your head down, just doing what you’re told, and putting out. No. I mean, going through boot camp and everything I’d, like, I’d be like oh that dude is definitely going to make it, and he ended up quitting. And the guys who are still here from my boot camp division, I, if you would have asked me I would have been like, maybe, I don’t know. Just, certainly the guys who are still here from my boot camp division, um, and the original 339 class, all super positive dudes, very smart, um, just great attitudes.","Uh, it's weird to say that cause you go get your ass kicked the whole time, and like you kinda come out the other end and you're like ""aaaaah"" hahaha. Yeah, uh yeah I think. Okay, so so the big one is my my body was prepared I think a lot of your guys go away because their bodies break i.e. shin splints and stress fractures. And that's because they just didn't run enough even though, like they're like mentally hard enough and strong enough to like make it. So like your body has to be able to do it. And I have very good joint movement. I am very flexible. I have very good mobility. Both things I, I consciously worked on before I came um. Strong, I have strong legs strong back it's really important to have a strong core for like boats and logs was stuff that gets me like so many people. So we started out I think at BO with one hundred fifty five or so candidates. With their bodies. And so that's about like right out of the gate as I think it's something, you know, a lot of people think of like the helmets on the ground are people that quit? But I don't think that's like even the majority. Um, so, one, my my body was prepared. Uh I think I think pole vaulting since I hated it so much and football cause I hated it so much but I knew it was a means, well pole vault specifically, a means to an end it really scared me. I really hated doing it. But I think that doing that for several years, and like being in that headspace of like this comfort six months of BUDS became doable. Like I like I thought of it It's like one track season, six months. Uh, yeah. Yeah. You know, it is weird. The fleet returnees the guys that this is the second time that at BUDS were some of like, like physically we're like the best. Yeah. Like we're the highest performers period in like I thought. No question. You know, I, I don't I don't I don't know why they quit.","Um, I think it's just as simple as, just wanting to do it, not quitting. Just, that's really all it is. Just want to be, better I guess. Um, well I know, it's weird, cause there's guys that are physically a lot, you know, more made out for this, and that don't make it. Um, I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, a lot of us are, are not, you know, the best at uh, you know, certain things, and we know failure and we’re able to accept that, and basically move on and want, you know, to be the best. And, like a lot of people that are, are good at certain things, almost everything, they're not used to that failure and they just don't know how to handle it. They've always been, you know, good at everything they do. So.","Umm just the I’ll just never quit uhh there’s moments like uhh how uh how am I gonna keep doing this, but you just do em. Like uhh you definitely like in the beginning I was definitely like scared but everything was so big and there was so much I had to go through but I kinda just put my head down and said “bring it on”. You know like what else more can you do to me. Uhh just the refusal to give up and just like uhh not being afraid to tackle what's behind the door that you’re about to face. Like not being afraid of any challenges or obstacles or pain that uhh like just not being afraid of what's behind the door that you’re about to open. Umm one was just my family like umm even if I was tired of it umm just that legacy of my family like uhh umm I think my Dad told me me and my brother I think Sunday or Saturday night, Saturday night or Sunday morning that he was going to be on the berm Friday when we secure whether or not, if we’re there or not. I just umm that was a really big motivator umm when I was in that dark void kinda spot like umm do it for the love of my family like my mom and my dad and not just for them but for myself like being, not having like you can’t put a price on being able to live with yourself I think that was a big part.","Um for me it was just like I pretty much gave up my whole life to come here um I’m not going to say there were never times where … I never really thought about quitting at all I knew I wasn’t going to quit for sure but just having that in the back of my head, having been though boot camp, I gave up my whole life to come here I knew that there was no way I was going to quit. I wouldn’t say I was a … I wasn’t a great performer by any means in BUD/S. I passed all my stuff you know I was fine um but its not like I was leading the 4 mile runs or the swims I was more of a middle of the pack guy. But for me I think one of my personality strengths that helped me get through is I was pretty stubborn and there was no way I was going to let the instructors see me quit. I wouldn’t let them win. Like I said my parents were always very supportive um honestly if I were to quit they would have been the parents that said that’s OK they wouldn’t have been super disappointed or anything like that um … but yeah there wasn’t anything big it was just not quitting you know and just passing all the tests you need to pass. And a little bit of luck too you know, not getting injured, not getting crazy sick is big. That’s the advice that I always give guys going through First Phase you know, just take care of your body because once you get sick or injured there’s not much you can do, you’re kinda screwed. For me I felt like most of the guys that made it through I kinda knew that they would make it through I don’t know if that makes sense. Yeah kinda their demeanor. We used to say a lot in First Phase that he’s got the eyes. Like we knew somebody was gonna quit just by like their demeanor every day um so just the guys that they could beat us all day long and they could wake up the next day with a good attitude. A huge thing was um being able to have a sense of humor that was huge. Like a ton of these guys in here have a sense of humor, that’s huge in making in through BUD/S um a lot of the guys that took everything way too seriously when we were in Prep and in BO, a lot of those guys did not make it. Um so just um being able to lock it on when you need to but also having a sense or humor was big for me um … yeah just guys that don’t take themselves too seriously, guys that are able to, you’re gonna have a bad day in BUD/S where you get embarrassed or you’re a poor performer or you know you might get called out. Just not letting that eat you alive … and then just guys that didn’t take into account what the instructors were saying, not taking that too seriously. I saw a lot of instructors get in guys heads and then they’ll quit so basically just not caring about what an instructor has to say to you. Kinda just knowing the game, knowing that they’re just trying to get you to quit and not taking that too seriously.","Um think I-I think I had a really good friend group um a lot of close friends here uh then family uh yea family friends I just I knew if I-I didn’t go all the way, I’d just disappoint them and I didn’t want to do that. Um I’m not sure I-I think there’s hundreds of different reasons like some of the fleet returnees that were getting out in a few months um they had that option um I don’t know I didn-I didn’t have a plan B to this and that was that was very intentional. Um I didn’t want to have an alternative cause some guys, there was some dude who had like a Masters um i don’t know uh. Yes something crazy and he uh he quit cause he had a backup plan um he knew he'd be fine if he didn’t make it um. Yea","Um, I don't know. Like finishing BUDS and being like successful, like conquering it. I feel are different in my mind. Just because the guys are here and they're doing it like like why can't I? Like I don't want to let them down. Another big thing and like, this is something I want to do. I really don't have to good of an answer for that. Ok. um, so I think a lot of guys and I know this is not for everyone, but they lose desire for it. Or they didn't have the desire in the first place. Like, I know a lot of guys who had gotten rolled twice or once in they're like in that in-between period when you're not in it for a long time. And you can lose desire for what you're doing. I know like getting rolled, I had to like reignite that flame. And uh, but I know a lot of guys who. Also switching ideas, guys who didn't even want to do the job in the first place. A lot of guys just want to be a SEAL and not really do job because it is pretty. I mean, the further you go on you realize that it's so much more then. It's harder then, then just making it through Hell Week.",… It’s just … I chose to keep going … and also putting others before yourself… and after Hell Week you start doing things that you somewhat like doing … So even lifesaving and going head to head with an instructor underwater … I found that fun. You know you're either aggressive or you start doing things that you like… At least from the guys that started First Phase because there’s some guys who started BO who just couldn’t pass a run or … but starting First Phase you see the guys who can physically make it but the guys who you see that there’s just nothing that can make them quit.,"Uh I’m stubborn. Uh if I put my mind to something its going to stay there a while and … its just like … I don’t want to get up and leave and then have to try this later its just like do it now and it sucks but whatever you’ll live. Um I always felt like they had like something always like limiting them like mentally I’m not sure if they were uncertain of their capabilities or uh they just didn’t like being hurt or training but I could tell guys who made it could suck it up or they’ll find something to laugh about.Uh at times yeah, especially after you get through something hard it helps like just relieve just a little bit of stress and then get focused on the next task.",Um I guess what I said before just the stubbornness you know the grind from everything just being able to handle that and not get distressed because people are yelling or anything like that so yeah I think just the constant grind and being able to handle that. Antying different… I mean I guess all the people that DOR they all had a different personality than these guys a less humble factor. All of these guys when you talk to them … well I guess you are making them talk about themselves but when you don’t when people aren’t they usually don’t and I think that that humbleness because all of those people that DOR they were all talking about how great they are and they were talking about how they can’t wait to do this next evolution even though everyone knows that evolution sucks so I guess just a different attitude towards things.,"Pretty easy going guy. I think that helps a lot of the hard times. You just kind of got to find the humor in it and get through it. It's not like if you dwell on everything, like, I feel like it would build on you and be pretty heavy. But I'm just kind of roll with the punches through it. I think just like not letting it get to you, just taking it one step at a time, like I got rolled that was like probably one of the bigger setbacks I've had at BUD/S, but was like the first time I got rolled. No one like you have to go all the way back through it. This, like, you just can't, you can't get overwhelmed by the whole process, you just got to live in a moment, you kinda get done what you got to get done at the time. Umm... It felt like they got in their own head mostly. Kind of like I was saying, like I got ahead of theirself thinking like, wow, this sucks. We got this and I still got to do this. They're not- they weren't focused on like living at the moment. Just getting through the evolution at hand. ","Um I thi-like like again I think like being able to uh to like laugh during the hard times and keep like a like a good head on your shoulders, um never taking yourself too seriously. Like a positive mental attitude. Yes. Ok and then those who dropped. I think they just got caught up in their head um cause like I-I by no means was physically superior to really anyone but like I think being able to being able to keep a good head on your shoulders during times that’s very easy to lose yourself in the bad things happening 
","Uh, I would say that I had a great friend group who were all very motivated that were here for the same reasons. Um...And just trying to impress them and, and make it through the program with them helped me kind of find my inner strength like, oh, if my buddies can do it, I can do it. And um...I just had sort of like this, like, if I'm going to, you know, I put a lot of time into it. And so if I'm going to give this my everything, like there's no way that I'm going to ring the bell or if I get injured, I get injured. But there's no way that I'm going to leave the program voluntarily. Um...I don't know, it's tough because I don't know if they're like lacked. I mean, I met some really good guys, ended up quitting. I don't know if they, they lacked anything per se. I just think they maybe had thoughts of doing something else. They maybe if they had something, something else going on in their lives, that, they might have just thought this wasn't for them. It's, it's, it’s weird because I like, a lot of the. I think that there a lot better guys than me that quit. Physical, mentally stronger. I think in the, in the end, it's just kind of like a decision like do you want to keep going or do you want to do something else. I think so. Definitely 


","Uhm, (laughing), I don’t know. It’s, it’s a tough question. (Unintelligible)I don’t know, maybe they just lost sight of what they were here for. Uhm. Personally, like it was, it was a huge decision for me to come out here and like my decision was made before I was out here, so. It (unintelligible), it’s just kinda like a simple way of explaining it, but that was really just how I felt about it.   No. I, I’ve just tried, I’ve just kinda realized that I have no idea who’s, who’s gonna be, you never know who’s not gonna make it, but I think there are some guys that just you can probably bet on by being like well-thought out and like, yeah I guess less impulsive (unintelligible) the guys that had to invest a lot more to get out here. ","I’d say probably just living in the moment and the biggest thing is probably just not caring to much about like any beatings or just looking at the small things and just having fun with it, I just find the humor in everything. That was probably the biggest thing just, yeah you’re getting hammered and you see somebody just make a weird sound or whatever and you see another guy [unintelligible] get hammered and he’s in the same boat as you, just laughing at the small stuff. That helped out, just not really caring too much about any of the beatings. Um I’d say the biggest thing uh pretty sure the stronger guys or guys you thought were mentally tough, they may not be consistent with the way they acted, like may be or like getting down on themselves, that was the weirdest contributing factor for some of the guys, or not really being present and thinking too far ahead. ","Like for me there was no other option. I mean, that's the best I could put it. Quitting or failing was something I never considered. I guess, I could never go home. Just a sense of shame. ",I just kept going. They thought too far ahead. ,"I didn't make the decision. I wasn't consciously, like, I'm going to stop. Until I'm told I'm done. I'm by no means the fastest, strongest, whatever. I think that's kind of a big deal during Hell Week, turning off any cognitive decision making during the time. You just keep going. Definitely during long paddles and stuff. And I also think that God. All the glory to God. I think it's kind of a miracle that I'm here. 

Biggest is whether it's getting in their head and say they say a lot of young guys go faster, maybe more athletic, or physically capable or younger than me. So maybe going back to that impulse. I evaluate things very heavily, especially on big decisions. Besides this, I couldn't even imagine living with myself at least, coming to that. Just setting a goal. The only other time in my life where things didn't work out was getting cut from the Football team. Then I never really knew what it was like other than that fail at that level. ","Preparation and desire. And luck. 
Not physically ready. Lack of life experience, maybe. ",,
"I think so. Uh I think I can handle stress pretty well now like it doesn;t shock shock and awe as much. better coping skilling and I think the word they were using was compartmentalize just kinda like break down problems as they rather then focus on the whole deal like um like cluster you’re in at the moment um I think it’s cool seeing like it was not fun at all or anything but it was cool seeing how much you can go through and still go um physically and um not sleeping for a while. confidence so like physical confidence whatever knowing that you can do it if you had too is a nice nice fall back 
","yes I think so, how, I think I’ve become more introverted than extroverted from when i started. maybe the last six to eight months I don’t know why maybe the whole quiet professional thing I’m starting to figure that out. yes yes trying to apply that. No I think that’s it you. um the biggest thing I can think of is it sounds kinda cliche but it’s always gonna end at the end of the day your gonna go home and your gonna take a shower and your gonna eat cause they have to feed you that's if you can just think of that, if i Had thought about that the first time I’m not saying I wouldn’t have quit I kinda go tin my head I would have just thought about that more, I’d probably be in a different spot ya. ","ya I'm more proud of the guy I am now than when I started I would say I wouldn’t say it made me tougher I wouldn’t say anything like that I feel like it brought out qualities I had and gave me a chance to test those qualities sense of humor stayed the same you know and I’m just happy, im generally a happy guy I don’t get pissed off a lot I’m just here to have a good time and make some friends uhh do some really cool job. uhh it’s good to confirm obvious like you know, it’s good to confirm it would save time I just I don’t know ya it helped with confidence I guess but I kinda I felt like I was trying to get through the training before I came in here. I didn’t come in saying oh I may or may not make I came in knowing I was going to get through whether that was self delusion or what it works. ",umm confidence wise I am more confident now definitely um kinda learn that even though you are not good at everything you can develop that skill develop um ways to get over obstacles and stuff like that umm it you know is weird thinking about when you first came how like unsure you were of like like you know when going to boot camp like should I be here you have those thoughts obviously that go through your head but then every time you uh get over that next test or next obstacle you’re like I’ve done this before I can do it again easier said than done people say that to you before but until you actually experience it ,um it makes you realize things are not that bad I guess but the majority of the time and that you can push through like a lot more than you think you could.  ya ya you are more confident doing normal tasks or that you’re someone’s asking you to do something that you don’t think’s possible you’re like oh that’s not that hard. ,I’d say so um confidence I think uh cause there was a lot of things that a lot of question marks a lot of like gut checks that you have to pass to get through and it’s like well I’ve done this so I can do that so I’m looking forward to the next challenge it’s more academic its JOTC so its like going to school again but no I think that that would be the things ya it’s just you have that ,"It really highlighted a lot of flaws that I you know sometimes it like the town I grew up in I was surrounded with people I had known my entire life so you are not really gonna get any new feedback like they’ll just accept you for the way you are like here if there’s something that that there’s a character trait that you have um that’s gonna be adverse to the team, their gonna let you know about it so you can fix it.. 100% in into something that will be more beneficial for me and I have a lot of growing to do a ton of growing to do, left just like. absolutely awareness, awareness that’s a great word. yes. really. How the heck can you quantify grit and resiliencey, how how can you do that. ",Um it it really the more you train the more you realize you one you either are actually doing it for the glamorous reasons or you’re actually doing it for the job. I feel like the more I trained the more I actually wanted the job and what its gonna take ,"Absolutely. I think the biggest thing is perspective on what it means to suffer. I feel I feel a lot older than I am just because when I'm in an area with peers, you know, you know, we go downtown or something and you're around, the 20 year old year olds instantly recognize that they have no idea what it means for the way that we have and they have no idea what they're capable of. We've kind of gotten a glimpse of that through some of the things we've been put through. We realize that our potential is incredible, but there's people out there no idea how much they can accomplish. No idea how hard it can rise. So I think the biggest thing that's changed about me is my weirdness of what you can do when you really set your mind to something. What's possible.",,"Absolutely. I think the biggest thing is that the confidence, knowing what you know, whatever you can throw at me, whatever the instructor throws me, whatever situation is going to be, it doesn't matter, you're gonna get through it. ","Um, I think it gives you confidence. But it's also like your opportunities and potentials untapped. You're never in question. You can literally do anything that you want. Which is cool. Like I've been compared to my other friends and they're like, I think you have superpowers.","Uh, hasn't changed me. I see this as just simply like an admissions ticket, and I'm still in college and I have a long more way to go, and hopefully I’m successful and have a job within this community and make a difference. But, it's just something that’s necessary to do and no different than completing anything else within the realm of what you view as important.","It, def- yeah, it definitely changed me. Um. definitely had, I can’t, I couldn't exactly say how or why but I feel, I’m definitely different than from when I, from when I joined.","Uh it makes you definitely more humble. That's for sure. Because at any given point in my friend's and I talk about this all the time. So I did really well in second phase quote on quote like on paper. But by no means is going to predict future success in BUDS you know and like, because, like I of a sudden, third phase, like you know for the pistol like it's it's relatively easy. It's not like OC-8 or Hell Week. Or It's like it's like this a huge numbers of fit, like it's just like, oh my gosh. All sudden I just. I can't shoot pistol. And so all of my friends have the same stories. They excel in some areas and it just naturally inclined to do well in some things, and then like other things and then like they just like suck like random. And I think that's because the curriculum is so diverse and exacting that you're eventually gonna find your,and they told us that in BUDS, you're eventually going to find something you suck at.","Um, I feel like I'm somewhat the same person. Um, probably would say, wouldn't say carefree, but just feel like before, growing up I was pretty, I would say I was a pretty good kid, didn't get into any trouble really. Uh, Didn't even drink until after i was 21. I just feel like I am a little more relaxed, because I was maybe more uptight growing up. Just trying to like, I had my head on straight, with school and baseball, um, I would just say that I'm a little more, like, yeah, laid back pretty much. Just kinda…",I definitely think I’ve matured like a lot in the past 7 or 8 months uhh I came here I definitely uhh was a procrastinator in high school umm I didn’t really have as much umm I still have some problems with it but I definitely didn’t have as much situational awareness umm as when I came here now I think I just uhh trying to be like uhh wanting to be squared away and being a good person and being a good student and uh one day hopefully be a good operator in the Teams,"Um … change me as a person … what definitely helped me as far as getting rolled that just helped me to deal with failure that taught me to come back a better person. Learn how to use that and turn that into a positive that was huge … um its definitely made me a less selfish person being around all these guys you know um just doing what’s best for the class not yourself and seeing how that returns as a positive to you. Uh as far as toughness and stuff, I came into this telling myself I wasn’t going to quit and I never felt like I was going to quit so I don’t really feel like I changed too much in that aspect um but obviously you do learn like how far you can push yourself and uh how far your body can go basically if you just don’t give up um I feel like that’s a lesson that everybody learns. Kinda a cliche lesson but its true … other than that … I don’t know uh I’ve learned a lot about leadership I’m trying to become a better leader. That’s something that they stress a lot here and if you’re just an E Dog, an enlisted guy, being able to step up and lead your buddy that’s something too that’s what you get from working on it. That’s something I’m not great at but have gotten better at since I’ve been working on it.",Yea definitely. Yea uh I don’t know if it’s made me a harder person or a softer person um. But it-I definitely don’t really like the ocean as much as I used to um. And I think um it's definitely made me mo-more confident in I guess my abilities just you  know and I can go through a lot of..shit. Come out the other end ok. ,"I feel like it's like coming into being a homeschooler, like kind of not being sheltered, like living in my own bubble. It's definitely blinded my. My world view of like. Meaning so many different people. That helps me. Discern like, because I have beliefs and what I believe. And then, like, it's kind of putting that to the test. On my own. You know, a lot of people can get swept away and like kind of just become an imprint of what their environment is. And so being able to stay alone. What you believe? Not even what you grew up believing but what you believe it's right. I didn't know that. It kinda was is a big lesson I had to learn. Be my own person not. Being totally. Because there's a lot of peer pressure in life and decide that and grow up and be like yo, this what I'm about. This is what I'm about to do. This is what going to do. I think a lot of guys can respect me for that. Just because, you know, even though I am really young. They see like. Ok he's about this. Even though they may not agree with it. They can still respect it.",Um humility. It’s hard at times.,I’ve definitely matured uh it’s taught me a lot of like how hard work can get you anywhere you got to go I’ve never really experienced that before in high school. Just shows like if you’re willing you can do anything.,Um I mean… I still think I’m still the same person that I was … I mean any mental aspect or … I don’t think that … no I don’t think that it really has changed me much I think I’m still the same person that I was in every aspect.,"Absolutely. I've definitely grown- facing adversity is like the way- I feel like once you make through this, you don't. Nothing really seems quite as big of an issue to you as it would be like before I went through this. So, like, if you gave me a really big problem, I'd be like, I don't I don't know what to do. But like I this program really teaches you to use your resources, do everything you can and kinda, like, attack any issue you have to attack. ","Um it’s..it’s made me realize one going through hell week and then also getting rolled then working hell week like like people are capable of doing some insane things and working through a lot uh gives like gives you like an appreciation for the guys you’re around and like the like the caliber of men in this world that are like willing to do this kinda work, it’s pretty impressive. Like like I would say so it was it’s uh yea I’m um I’m happy where where I’m at right now","Very humbling pipeline. Uh, it teaches you a lot about yourself in a way that, that I don't think that I would ever figure out. Like...there's always going to be somebody better than you. You can never, you can never not find work. You will always have something to do and you should always be improving. And I learned more in these six months at BUD/S than I did in my entire sports career. It’s like...you're always going to be humbled. There's always something to do. You know, it's just kind of like a microcosm of life itself. It's really interesting talking to my buddies all the time of, like, learn more in these six months I feel like I have almost the entirety of my entire life playing sports for sure.","It’s definitely given me great perspective on different people, uhm. Just, a lot of different experiences that you go through. I think the, one of the bigger lessons that I’ve learned though is to just, you never know who, who you’re dealing with and kind of the deeper levels of, of people and getting to know them better and giving guys a second chance and being surprised who they, who they are who you thought they were. ",,,"I think I can control my emotions better, like control reactions better. ","Realizing how much your mind can overcome. There's no question like I didn't do a good job stretching and managing my back and stuff. But I think part of it was definitely mental too. I didn't want to go through the rest of my life saying I can't do this because of my back. Because there's not things or life. I learned a lot about myself through Hell Week. Keep my mindset just going to keep me moving forward. And see how much more I can accomplish. I'm really thankful, I think a lot of other guys speak negatively, or just decided this sucks or whatever. But after first phase guys think that we're not going to be beat or whatever. I really enjoyed it, I think, one, I feel really lucky to be here. Two, really just glad to be through BUD/S.",,,

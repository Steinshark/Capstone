A: And If I could ask you to state your participant ID and is it ok if I record

74: yes

A: ok so this survey is anonymous and um (Unintelligible, lots of static feedback) 

A: So I'm gonna start by asking How many siblings do you have?

74: I have one sister uh casey she's 11 months older than I am  

A: ok sure 11 months older ok great and if you think about your life experience what would you describe as your crucible or life changing experiences. 

74: umm I did a kairos retreat in highschool  

A: ok

74: um it’s like I’m not like super religious but that was kinda like a cool experience 

A: ya

74: turned to like strengthening relationships with family

A: ok

74: my dad especially um and then honestly I think uh 

A: Was he on that retreat with you?

74: No he wasn’t but it was kinda like a a like we wrote letters and stuff

A: ya 

74: like him and I always sort of had a strange relationship but that kinda brought us together a little but 

A: ya

74: and then uh going to Navy I think for me uh I needed discipline in my life at the time and uh I think it was uh really good for me and then getting into trouble at the Naval Academy like a lot uh it was uh kinda took me from not not not so good pat and turned me around 

A: ya 

74: kinda forced me to look myself in the mirror and uh change a lot of things

A: so making mistakes while you were there 

74: yes

A: working through it ok um how did those experiences factor into your experience here at buds?

74: um I mean I think I took the value of relationships early on and uh

A: ok

74: also like I was very familiar what it felt like to fail 

A: ok

74: so and I think that’s what messes with guys a lot out here you got these all american guys who come out here and theyve never failed before and uh you got someone whose royally messed up and uh they know what it’s like and then I think it helps from a leadership perspective you know give guys second chances and then knowing which guys are worth working with and so I think those kids  

A: ya how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through buds 

74: um 

A: do you remember your personality from pre then  

74: um I was trying to recall things but no no I don't remember as much as I should

A: personality like your openness, variableness, conscientiousness, extroversion , neuroticism  

74: oh well oh ya I think um i’m a pretty light hearted guy 

A: ya 

74: and having a sense of humor is a huge thing for buds like  

A: ok 

74: if your able to laugh about your current situation

A: ya 

74: then it makes it so much better

A: ya 

74: um so I think that’s huge cause I always found myself doing that and you know when your running to hit the surf and that’s the last thing you want to do it’ll be like what the hells going on right now 

A: ya 

74: something like that something I thought that was something I enjoyed so ya 

A: ya anything else? Extroversion, introversion

74: ya I think extroversion was huge to I think uh like as an officer like that was good cause like being extroverted like your not always gonna be uh you can’t really be introverted and I don’t think and have it work like to a certain extent you can but uh

A: ya

74: going in and having that extroversion like uh reaching out and uh being able to talk to guys was huge and then uh I found like uh guys who were drawn like to  certain people like who responded well to that 

A: ya 

74: I mean most most of these guys are extroverted

A: ya

74: but there;s maybe like five guys that i would consider introverts out of our class of like sixty so uh

A: ok 

74: extroverts are all attracted to each other 

A: ya ok so describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community

74: I grew up I grew up in the upper middle class probably my dad was a marine so I wanted to be in the military for a long time,

A: ya 

74: he was enlisted so when I wanted to join the military he pointed me towards the Naval Academy just cause like I don’t think he loved being enlisted and I think he saw the opportunities that an officer had and uh he’s like dude if you’re gonna do it do it right

A: ya 

74: and then I joined like in my pre-teen years and I like hated the idea and then uh went to highschool and got hit with the travis manion uh story cause he went to my high school and then uh so i wanted to be a marine for a while

A: Travis Mannion went to your highschool

74: yes um so that got me really interested in the Naval Academy and had the opportunity to play lacrosse there and then you play lacrosse at Navy Brendan Looney comes into play big time and so that kinda shifted me towards the uh towards the SEAL teams

A: tell me alittle about your childhood I’m particularly interested in discipline and your family parenting style so was there splaning, uh timeout, grounding, loss of privileges, uh taking your video games away, soap in mouth

74: ya so my dad like was a marine right so like I had a shaved head I had a buzz cut till I was in 8th grade 

A: ok

74: um very disciplined I had like certain chores I had to do everyday every weekend and they had to be done right like my dad would go out and inspect the garage after I swept it and if wasn’t good I had to do it again 

A: ok

74: and I thought he was just being a dick but like I realized he’d always tell me that’d I’d thank him one day and like now I’m looking back I have like some sort of like discipline and I had I’m able to like follow through on things and do things right like the first time and I’m like holy crap he was right but ya uh a belt was a thing my mom was like

A: spanking with belt

74: ya uh loss of stuff like taking away whatever game system or my cell phone or grounding I was all in um  

A: loss of privileges

74: ya uh like that so ya it was definitely like very strict my dad was very strict in terms of what I wore what my sister wore like how we wore our hair like if my hair was messy he’d tell me I looked homeless 

A: How about your teenage years did you move around a lot what was when he was a marine were you 

74: no so uh he joined the reserves when I was born and then retired at 40 so he was in the reserves when I was young and then uh

A: so you stayed in the same like

74: So I grew up in Southern Philadelphia and stayed there my whole life from like one town over cause my dad started a new company   

A: ya so the sports in highschool and then in college lacrosse

74: yes

A: for one and then uh that’s D1 uh D1 uh and anything else you were invovled in that had a close or tight knit community so other activities or other

74: uh just pretty much just uh sports 

A: ok 

74: uh multiple different sports teams 

A: ok 

74: uh I I was in a a playing community service group in high school

A: ok

74: uh that was pretty cool, battalion service club

A: ok 

74: so that was pretty cool 

A: ok what other sports besides lacrosse did you 

74: football was my other bug one then I wrestled for one year

A: ok 

74: just staying shape 

A: ok cool uh so the last five years prior to BUD/s tell me about you were at the Academy did you decide it’s busy at the academy did you do anything else like travel or other experience

74: ya uh traveled a lot especially that my TAD year because I had a like a predump just cause I was like (unintelligible) 

A: ya 

74: so I traveled a lot then a Ireland once and then like all over the country visiting guys and then uh that was one trip  but ya I uh did a lot did a lot in the general Annapolis area uh pretty busy went to DC and Baltimore all the time 

A: would you consider yourself impulsive 

74: probably I think uh ya I would say if it’s for a good reason I'm down 

A: ok do you have any tattoos 

74: I don’t no 

A: ok um do what about speeding tickets or 

74: ya uh I actually got one right before we headed out I was trapped down in Virginia Beach and my if you're going on the eatern shore side so I was going like 81 in a 45 or something like that  

A: ok 

74: reckless driving technically so that was part of the deal with during first phase 

A: ok so did you have to go to court 

74: I I got an attorney to go on my behalf Originally they said no you have to go cause it was a misdemeanor

A: ok  

74: but I I got an attorney to get me out of the ticket but he got me out of the court 

A: anything else that would be impulsive or kinda reckless behavior

74: ya I got in some trouble so I put this like the interview so it’s like the interview for destruction of property plebe year, it’s just like breaking stuff uh I paid for it so uh  

A: were you drunk

74: ya ya 

A: so alcohol related incidents

74: ya a few of those um not anymore um ya so 

A: um what motivates you on a daily basis

74: I think my family for sure 

A: ok

74: uh and uh definitely like not letting these guys down I think being like being a part of a team like that’s been such a constant in my life since the fourth grade when I started sports 

A: ya 

74: it’s just so the better you do the better everyone does and uh just being driven by that like I live with guys and one of them is going to workout after this and now I’m going so it’s just like trying to get better and just competitions

A: like competition and peer pressure in a good way

74: ya I think competition are like ya ya I think peer Ya positive peer pressure

A: ya 

74: which is stimulated by this kind of environment

A: what was the most challenging part of buds so think about buds was there a day or an event where you were just like really

74: I hated the uh the uniform inspections the most cause I was like probably gonna fail and uh that was just like a shot to the heart cause you would spend so much time and you just ya I didn’t like those but all the physical stuff was particularly bad and like we went through like a summer class so it wasn’t like that cold so you gotta get to the guys who are going through first phase now it’s really cold

A: ya 

74:  but no I thought uniform I hated that stuff cause you spent so much time 

A: what motivated you to push through it when things were hard

74: like the uniform inspections specifically

A: like really hard right where you felt yourself maybe having doubts or  

74: I think like the legacy like there's never been a navy lacrosse player to quit buds so I wasn't gonna be the first apparently uh there's more like asterisks but it's kinda like medical type thing um so like um so like as I was told before going in so like you don’t wanna be  that guy right then um one of my classmates uh told me this one thing uh it’s like you so when you quit you put your helmet on the grinder right so your your name is on the ground so

A: ya 

74: so your putting your name like down in the dirt 

A: ya 

74: and I’m like I’m not gonna let that 

A: ya 

74: I don’t want like your name to be associated with a quitter

A: family name um helmet

74: ya which gets put on the grinder and everyone walks by they are like dang they are literally looking down at it right

A: ya 

74:  it's like a symbolic thing for me and I’m not gonna let that happen

A: ya are there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used to push through the challenges pray meditate 

74: I’m not really religious but I pray ummm 

A:how about like you know being an athlete or rituals or workouts or games like the that get you ready physically ready and mentally

74: I would like eat sing and get breakfast every morning 

A:ok

74: every morning I had a frosted mini wheats and watermelon

A:ok

74: and watermelon and I had a good day one day like the first day so I was like this must be the reason why  

A: ok

74: and so I like every day that we had breakfast in buds I had a and besides that i don't know I’m pretty ritualistic or superstitious oh like like uh I wore like I wore like the same shirt a lot or like uh someone had a good idea was like every not first phase in first phase I got fifteen shirts right because they were work days and I’d just throw white shirt out at the end of the day and I’d start each day with a  fresh white shirt  

A:ok

74: just stuff like that i guess but like by uh like in second phase you have all the pool comp stuff so I’d wear the same brown shirt everyday till I like failed and then switch it and start a new one and then in third phase which sounds gross but I mean it is kinda gross and  but then in third phase I did that same thing too it’s like I’d pass one qual and I’d just keep wearing the same shirt till I passed the next one and then changed eventually but things were going good so if it ain’t broke don’t fix it right

A: ok when you made a difficult, can you think of a difficult decision you made during training and what went through your mind as you made that decision so can you give me an example of a tough decision and I know you don’t make many decisions for yourself when you’re at buds but

74: ya 

A: were there any 

74:um 

A: that you can think of 

74:I think like the peer ranking were difficult decisions I actually did make one there was a guy in my uh I’m not sure if I did the right thing or not but there was a really young guy in our in our group group he was like 19 fresh out of high school he was an absolute stud of a performer but like super immature like uh we told him that before and it’s kinda getting out of hand with like talking saying things at inappropriate times like he’ll make really really bad and I was his fireteam leader and I put him in my bottom five and I wrote in there I don't think he’s a bad performer and I think he should be here but I think he needs to have a tough conversation about maturity right but then like everyone knows who the bottom five are right and I was talking to one of the instructors he came up and I talked out it and kinda publicly shamed the guy when I coulda taken more of a mentor role and so that’ll be a tough decision that I made that didn’t end up working out and made me kinda like ok maybe I shoulda tried harder but here is one way in buds when I coulda been an officer so after that I shifted tried to be more of a mentor role cause I was like six years older than the guy and it ended up working out

A: so the decision you made was to use the 

74: use the box

A: use the ranking system

74: yes when and I put the disclaimer in there like hey I don;t think he’s a bad performer but ya so that would be a tough decision I made that ended up teaching me something about like that peer relationships or something that you can do rather than publicly shame somebody 

A: ok so what went through your mind when you made that decision when you used the formal peer ranking as the tool 

74:um I didn’t feel comfortable going up to the instructors saying hey can you go and talk to this guy 

A:ya 

74: the I realized that would have been much much better than just like writing a little blurb on the hey I don’t think he's actually that bad you know um 

A:ya 

74: so I think that would have been so that's where I learned like maybe I think I was hiding behind it a little bit cause I didn't really know exactly what to do so I chose the easy the less comfortable option

A: ya 

74: so (long pause)   

A: ok um why do you think you were successful why do you think you were successful getting through buds

74: uh 

A: and why do you think others did not make it 

74: I think I have like a really really strong support system coming from my family friends and then uh guys I was really close with out here like I mean I lived with five other four other O’s who were all in my class so I knew a bunch of dudes I think I had a lot of reasons to be here and I didn't really have another option I think that was it like we were doing this or like going to the fleet like I can’t and not like coming back and I think like I just wanted it for a long time

A:ok

74: ok I don;t know I wasn’t but ya I think the support system was huge 

A: ok did you notice anything different about those that didn’t make it

74: ya 

A: there trends 

74: ya I think guys didn’t make it but have a plan b um ya I think a lot of people did or or they started looking for them and you have a bad day and it’s not really that bad right something like that right 

A:ya 

74: you know for us it’ll be like you know what would suck right now the bridge you know that would suck you know I’m cold but at least I’m not standing a four hour watch on the the fucking aft you know look out you know what i mean I’d say something like tha but uh 

A:ya ok anything else?

74: no you kinda hear the same stuff uh oh it's just not for me so I respect the guys that realize that what what is worse is the people who know it’s not for them but don’t want to quit and drag the other guys down I thought that was I had no respect for those guys but the guys who were man enough to just say hey this this is not for me like I’m out like no no ill will towards those guys but ya its the ones who like and like you hear people say some people say I know I’m not performing but I'm not quitting

A: ya 

74: it’s like you’re you’re old prune but you’re one sixth of this and it’s like it doesn’t matter if you do that in second phase like you you’re by yourself right 

A: ya

74: first phase its like all team 

A: ya 

74: so its like that pisses me off and then they would get rolled or dropped or whatever but I don't feel bad for them because they aren’t a good teammate

A: alright did this experience at buds change you

74: I’d say so um confidence I think uh cause there was a lot of things that a lot of question marks a lot of like gut checks that you have to pass to get through and it’s like well I’ve done this so I can do that so I’m looking forward to the next challenge it’s more academic its JOTC so its like going to school again but no I think that that would be the things ya it’s just you have that 

A:ya 

74:tool belt I remember ya 

A: uh is there anything else that we didn’t talk about that you want to share anything that you think would be helpful for the research team anything you think we should be asking 

74: no I think you guys pretty much covered it all ya I can’t really think of anything

A: ok awesome I’ll turn this off

109: yes when I was growing up they lived with us until I was like ten years old 

A: ok and then you lived with your mother

109: yes and then I lived with the rest of my

A:ok um until ten, ok if you think of your life experiences, childhood, teenage years, what might you describe as your crucible or life changing experiences 

109: lets see so I moved uh when I was ten we moved to Reno southern california and then uh I’d say the biggest one was when I was fifteen it was about 2008 I believe both my parents lost their jobs and we had to move in with uh relatives back down in southern california 

A:ya 

109: so that was probably the craziest thing that happened

A:ok

109: ya I was pretty I was pretty fortunate until about then i was about 13 years old or 14 15, I was pretty privileged until I was fifteen years old

A:ya, how did those experiences factor into your experiences at buds?

109: well I learned a lot from my parents my parents kinda found work multiple jobs kinda found different ways for us to kinda be able to do the things that our friends were doing like playing baseball going on trips and stuff like that so they kinda sacrificed a lot so we could a have the things that we wanted

A:ok

109: and then uh it was for my siblings it was a little harder them to see but for me i kinda saw what they were doing behind the scenes, stuff like that um, so ya I’d definitely say a little I got most of kinda that everything that you do is bigger than you I got that from my parents

A:ok 

109: and they never made an excuse they never complained they kinda just uhh they kinda just worked and worked multiple jobs and didn’t sleep and didn’t eat just for us and that was really inspiring and that kinda continued kinda still like today kinda the same way bt  

A:ya, how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through buds

109: I guess I’m more kind of a quiet and I kinda just want to I’m also competitive and definitely through buds it's kinda it’s kinda the thing where uh you are always you don’t you wanna do better than the guy next to you like especially with a lot of like the guys here like some of the guys i’ve gone straight through with it’s kinda like that you know I’m not gonna let you make if I’m not gonna make it we started kinda attitude and you kinda started developing that in boot camp, the same guys I hung out with in boot camp are the same guys I hang out with now and it’s funny how that worked out   

A:ya 

109:cause theres a bunch of little clicks when you first get there and you kinda see um  you know those same people and clicks and I don’t know how that

A: so going back to being this on your personality  

109: oh ya 

A: is it a loyalty to friends

109: ya loyalty it’s definitely a loyalty for me

A: cause I’m gonna ask about your community and your friends here in a second, describe your background in becoming part of the uh SEAL community

109: So i played sports my whole like, I played basketball in college, uh 

A: at div uh

109: it was a division two university

A: ok

109: uh always had you know that want to compete and I’ve always been passionate about serving my country

A: ok

109: and uh obviously the SEAL community is kinda that tier one community that you want to be apart in the military and it’s something that that I just wanted to be apart of 

A: ok can you tell me a bit about and you did tell me a little about your childhood and your moving but im interested in your like family’s parenting style, particularly discipline, so 

109: ok

A: sounds like a lot of kids uh you know spanking

109:ya spanking

A: ok 

109: spanking, it was definitely more of tough love

A:ok

109: learn quickly how to not get caught doing things

A:ok um so is this hand on butt or belt, is this paddle is this 

109: ah this is wooden spoon ya the wooden spoon

A: ok wooden spoon, how about soap in the mouth

109: uh ya they used to mouth I never got it but they definitely did get soap in the mouth

A: ok um and then like in the last five years of your life, what have you been up to before buds, and would you consider yourself impulsive

109: yes ya I would consider myself impulsive definitely

A:ok um 

109: the fact that I enlisted in the military was a very impulsive decision 

A:ok 

109: ya it was something I had always been planning on doing buyt

A: ok

109: the decision definitely wasn’t calculated, it was just one day I walked into the office and enlisted

A: ok do you have any tattoos

109: no 

A: ok how about speeding tickets

109: no speeding tickets 

A:ok um so the decision to enlist was kinda a big impulsive

109: yes

A: can you give me any other examples of being impulsive

109: uhhhhh lets see so uh I had been offered scholarships to go play basketball and uh I guess the day that I signed to go to the school that I went to I kinda just sick of waiting around and I just wanted to sign so I just signed, I wanted to stay in california it wasn’t necessarily as good of a school it wasn’t a division one school that I wanted but I just made the decision to sign and not wait to try and get something better so that was kinda an impulsive decision.

A: What motivates you on a daily basis?

109: um well something that definitely you now uh grad getting to a SEAL team and deploying is the ultimate goal you know BUD;s at first now it’s not only getting to a SEAL team but being able to contribute something in a positive way once you get to a SEAL team

A: so being able to contribute 

109: ya it’s more than just getting there being an asset 

A: what was the most challenging component of BUD/s, this is a holistic question so think about your hardest day or event um what was the most challenging

109: I guess the most the most challenging thing is probably when uh I guess it was kinda lose focus and looking at the big picture instead of focusing on individual tasks that you were doing, like during hell week if it was Sunday night of hell week you were like Jesus I have five more days of this I don’t know if I can do that, that’s when you have to recognize that negative small talk and sort of look at the small picture for me i guess during hell week i can kinda remember um focusing on uh you know one step at a time rather than looking at the big picture and even when you finish hell week and think about everything else you have to do it’s still kinda overwhelming it's kinda just one step at a time getting through OC8, getting through your pistol qual, getting through your rifle qual   

A:ya 

109:so 

A: its all that compartmentalization

109: ya

A:was there anything that motivated you to push through hell week in particular 

109: ya my buddy, I didn’t want him to get through and I didn’t get through I didn’t want to have to tell my family that I quit

A:ok

109:um that was probably the main thing was embarrassing my family most of all and having to put my helmet on the grinder 

A:ok 

109: and having my name out there 

A: so when you your buddy is it competition with the buddy

109:ya it’s competition

A:ok 

109: that’s kinda more of a the that's part of it definitely 

A: do you feel supported by the group is there encouragement

109: ya definitely definitely

A: ok uhhh is there any other practices whether its physical mental or spiritual that you use to get you through challenging times, prayer, meditation, stretching 

109:yes I do pray

A: you do pray 

109: um stretching not so much

A:some athletes will do a pregame ritual 

109: so like ya I guess this was more of a second diving thing but visualization

A:ok 

109:definitely is huge probably the most important thing

A: ok 

109:ya um visualization

A: when you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/s what went through your mind as you made that decision 

109: um let’s see uh how is it going to affect people around me so is that is this more like a tactical decision 

A:uh did you can you recall can you give me an example of a tough decision throughout the entirety of BUD/s and kinda talk me through it 

109: ya so BUD/s you are mostly told what to do 

A: right 

109: and you kinda do what you are told it’s kinda once you get out to the island you start making decisions like on your own like I mean decisions putting obviously but decisions the decisions to cut corners right or something like that take the easy way out instead of the decision to do something where you could cut a corner it’s more of like is this gonna make somebody else's day harder I guess i mean that;s probably what most people will say here that they hold they hold their classmates in very high regard and they don’t want to do something to uh kinda have these guys look down on you I mean they say you are constantly being evaluated even if the instructors aren’t there

A:right ya 

109: we’re evaluating each other on something

A: alright ummm why do you think in completing BUD/s and why do you think others were not

109: maturity I think I I i uh lived on my own since I was 18 moved out went to college graduated got my own place paying bills stuff like that obviously there's some young guys here but they don’t know what it's like to get out on their own they don’t really know what the consequences of what happens if you don’t if you don’t I mean I knew I knew that making it through the program and having to go out to the fleet I knew that how bad that could be and    

A: ok

109: and uh I don’t think people realize what the consequences or what can happen if you don’t work hard or you know apply yourself and finish what you start 

A: Did you notice anything about people that didn;t make it what did they have in common

109:ummm selfish I think I think they cared more about themselves then the people around them

A:ok

109: umm when things got bad things got scary they felt sorry for themselves they didn’t really care how anyone else was feeling or ya 

A:ya 

109: I think they didn’t know how to see the big picture

A:ok (long pause) how did you change as a person

109: umm confidence wise I am more confident now definitely um kinda learn that even though you are not good at everything you can develop that skill develop um ways to get over obstacles and stuff like that umm it you know is weird thinking about when you first came how like unsure you were of like like you know when going to boot camp like should I be here you have those thoughts obviously that go through your head but then every time you uh get over that next test or next obstacle you’re like I’ve done this before I can do it again easier said than done people say that to you before but until you actually experience it 

A:was there anything that I didn’t cover uh that you would like to share 

109: no you pretty much hit everything

A:ok ok great thank you so much

109: awesome

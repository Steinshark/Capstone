They moved me around and i worked for them installing security systems and when i saved enough money i went on a two year mission with my church um to indonesia so that filled up two and a half years of my life uim when i got back i worked for the same company again installing security systems  and security cameras and i enjoyed it i made a lot of money i was very it was very challenging i knew it wasn't going anywhere i knew that not what i wanted to do with my life for the rest of my life and um and that filled two more years i was working that job for two more years and i had that life changing experience where i found myself in jail and i knew i didn like the job so i decided to start  

Interviewer: doing what you really wanted to do 



Participant: doing what i really wanted to do 



Interviewer: would you consider yourself impulsive like do you do tattoos do you binge drink  i'm just trying to figure out about your personality a little bit 



Participant: i would say i'm impulsive but it's not like recess i don't have any tattoos umm  i really think about my decisions so but i if you say i dunno lets go skydiving i'll probably go skydiving if there is an adventure i'll probably do it if its reckless adventure i'll think about it for sure 



Interviewer: okay that helps .yeah so think about your crappiest day at BUDS you're worst day what was it and what motivated you to push through. 



Participant: umm it was being it was being beat by the instructors they wanted me to quit it was 5 instructors they were beating me physically and were all tearing me down mentally words saying you should be here it was very hard and they were telling me reason i shouldn't be here and i pushed through it because i knew what they were saying was not true but if what they were saying was true i definitely would have quit i the beatings the physical beatings they physically beatings they were giving me were hard but that's just buds if it's just like everyday you go through it you get it done at the end of the day you wake up 

Interviewer: so what motivated you while that was happening what were you thinking to say i'm not going to let this im not gonna listen to what they're saying because it's not right its not true. 

Participant:i told them if what they were saying is true i would quit but i know its not i know i'm not that guy so i im yeah i'm not that guy i live to serve and i love serving.  



Interviewer: okay what so are there any mental practices that you used any spiritual things that you use to like help you get through those challenges like did you say a prayer did you meditate anything that you can think of

Participant:um i'm religious i pray my family is religious they pray for me i don't know if that helped

Interviewer:i think so 



Participant:yeah okay then yes yeah i think so i other than that 



Interviewer: nothing 



Participant: nothing really



Interviewer: okay did you have any decisions that you personally had to make about someone turning someone in or someone that was cheating give me an example and what made went through your mind as you were think about that and if you don't have anything that's fine too

Participant:yeah i don't have anything 



Interviewer: okay why do you think you were so successful at completing BUDS? 



Participant:. Determination 



Interviewer: mhm lemme ask it a different way there are a lot of people that were in your class who aren't here today what made them different than you 



Participant:.yes um sometimes it wasn't even their choice you know they maybe failed a test and thats why theyre not here um other than that like during the harder stuff they quit maybe they haven't gone through pain or such a severe as challenging obstacle 



Interviewer:ahuh do you think this whole BUDs experience has changed you as a person? 



Participant: yes definitely 



Interviewer: in what way 



Participant: um just during through the training i can see the um what stress can do to you and learning how to deal with that stress and learning how to work with a team to get through challenges but you don't you're not exposed to stress or you're not expected to perform under stress in the civilian world so that that really 



Interviewer: not like this



Participant:.not like this yeah



Interviewer: Okay so the navy hired us to try to figure out what makes people successful when they come to buds and try to learn a little more about that before they select people for BUDS what should i have asked you that i didn't ask you that might help us figure that out? 





Participant: id say you asked everything 



Interviewer: okay 

Participant: you asked about life experiences before that might have helped me 



Interviewer: okay

Participant: yeah .



Interviewer: okay

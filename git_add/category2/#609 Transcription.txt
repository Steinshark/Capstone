Dr. Luning:

Um, this recorder and I'm gonna have a backup here. Okay. So, it is January 4th, 2022, and I'm here with, uh, interview 609. So thanks for coming. (laughs) Um, so, I'm gonna ask a bunch of questions about kind of your childhood, your background, a little bit, uh, about your experience here at BUD/S. Um, feel free to answer any or not answer any. It's completely up to you. (laughs) So, first question, easy question, is what phase did you leave BUD/S?

608:

First phase.

Dr. Luning:

First phase. Okay. Um, and how many weeks ago did you leave?

608:

Um, that's... It would've been maybe like eight?

Dr. Luning:

Okay. So, what would that have been, like November, October?

608:

It's tough to rem-... It's tough to... Sorry, hold on. (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

No problem.

608:

I'm trying to remember. Um... yeah, I think O- October.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

I'm not 100% sure on that.

Dr. Luning:

No problem. Um, so, tell me just a little bit about your childhood.

608:

Um, like where I'm from or...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah, just what comes to mind.

608:

Uh, I'm from Pennsylvania.

Dr. Luning:

Okay, where in Pennsylvania?

608:

Uh, Chambersburg.

Dr. Luning:

Chambersburg. Where is that? I'm from Western Maryland originally.

608:

Okay.

Dr. Luning:

It's like-

608:

It's like South Central.

Dr. Luning:

Okay, okay.

608:

[crosstalk 00:01:40] minutes north of Maryland, of Hagerstown.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

[crosstalk 00:01:42].

Dr. Luning:

I'm like, I know where Chambersburg is.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

I just couldn't place it. Yes.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

So I know exactly where it is.

608:

Okay.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. Small town.

608:

Yep, small town. Very small.

Dr. Luning:

Did you grow up there your whole life?

608:

Yep, I was there my whole life.

Dr. Luning:

Brothers? Sisters?

608:

I have one brother and one half-sister.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Okay, great. Um, how about did you always live in Chambersburg?

608:

Yep. Yeah. [crosstalk 00:01:59].

Dr. Luning:

Okay. So no moving around or anything like that?

608:

Nope. Never moved. No.

Dr. Luning:

Um, type of school, like what type of high school did you go to? Was it-

608:

Just a public school.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Public high school.

Dr. Luning:

Was it big? Small?

608:

Um, I think our graduating class was like 12, 1,200.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

So decently, decent size.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. So it's not tiny.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Um, what about, uh, your personality? How would you describe your personality and kind of three traits about it?

608:

Jeez. (laughs) I don't know. Um, personality... I'm not sure. I'm- I don't know. Uh... That's a tough one. I'm like, nervous.

Dr. Luning:

(laughs)

608:

I don't want to say the wrong thing, you know?

Dr. Luning:

No, there's nothing wrong. I mean, it... This is... So to give you, give you a sense, I mean, it's really... We're just trying to kind of understand people that go through this experience.

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

Um, and what it is. 'Cause it's unique. It's unique to go to BUD/S and to experience BUD/S in any form.

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

And so we're really just trying to understand like, what's- what's different, right? The majority of the population doesn't go through this experience. (laughs)

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

And, um, and so we're trying to kind of pull back the onion and understand those pieces and things.

608:

Okay.

Dr. Luning:

But... Yeah.

608:

Yeah, so I don't, I don't think I'm... I don't think... I mean, normal maybe would be a word to describe me.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Normal.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Uh... (laughs) Maybe- maybe nerdy?

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Kind of nerdy. I like to play, uh, video games and-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... I have an engineering degree, so maybe that would [crosstalk 00:03:43].

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Where'd you go to school?

608:

Penn State.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Uh, main campus?

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Well, uh, two years at, uh, a branch campus and then two at main.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. So, uh, that was my first college actually.

608:

Really?

Dr. Luning:

I- I didn't end up graduating from Penn State. It was too big for me. (laughs)

608:

Oh, okay.

Dr. Luning:

I was like, "I can't take this." But, uh, I- I, uh, yes, I spent a year there.

608:

Oh, nice.

Dr. Luning:

So, a long time ago, but yes, I've been there. Uh, how'd you like Penn State?

608:

It was good. I... Like you said, it's big. So-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

It was nice to do my first two years where you do all the general classes-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... at a smaller- smaller school.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Yeah.

608:

And then by the time I got up to main campus, like, uh, you're into your specific major classes. So-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Smaller class. And...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. That's, um... 'Cause I was there and it was like 300 students I think in like a [crosstalk 00:04:30].

608:

Lecture hall? A lecture hall, yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. And I'm like, "I don't know what I'm learning." (laughs)

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

I don't have to be at class.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Did you do ROTC?

608:

Uh, no. I- I did talk to a... I tried to do ROTC, but I was in my th- uh, third year already.

Dr. Luning:

Oh, okay.

608:

So you needed like, uh, you needed two years.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Or I was in my second to last year, so you needed two years of ROTC-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... in order to actually do, like, get commissioned [crosstalk 00:04:56].

Dr. Luning:

Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, um, and- and so, after- after you graduated, what'd you do after graduation?

608:

Um, I worked-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... as a, as an engineer for three, three-and-a-half years almost.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So...

Dr. Luning:

And then what made you wanna join the Navy?

608:

Um, I wanted to do something, I wanted to do something a little bit more challenging.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And work with, uh, work with like, people that were... I mean, I liked my job. But it was, it was like, not- not like enough.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, for me. So... I wanted to do something cool. And I have a buddy who's, uh, in s- in special, a different branch of service in special operations.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. Got it.

608:

And he was absolutely loving what he was doing, so...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Kind of got me on the track of it.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Army? Air Force? Marines?

608:

My friend?

Dr. Luning:

Your buddy, yeah.

608:

He's in the Marine Corps.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. So, I kind of asked some of this, but I'll ask specifically. What have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/S?

608:

Um, so, two years, uh, like, the furthest- furthest back two years, I would've been in school.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

And then, like I said, for the past three-and-a-half years, I was... Well, actually, yeah. So worked for three-and-a-half years. School before that. And then I actually, uh, quit my job, like, w- what ended up being almost seven months ahead of joining the Navy, just to like, specifically train for this.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah, yeah.

608:

And I had a h-... Sold my house. Moved in with my parents. (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

Oh, wow. Okay.

608:

Which was kind of weird, 'cause I'm older, so...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Moved back. And I'm married, too.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

So my wife both... and she was on board, so-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

We moved back in with my parents and I was just training for this and...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... and joined.

Dr. Luning:

O- okay. Great.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Um, what about... If you kind of think of your life experience, it can be in the last five years, it can be, um, even before that. What would you say are maybe some life-shaping experiences?

608:

Um... Life-shaping. Uh, well, I've been to, uh... Oh, that... One- one would be, uh, I've been to... My wife does mission work in India.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

So I went down once and visited her-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... for like, 10 days.

Dr. Luning:

Wow.

608:

So, that was the first time I'd really been... It wasn't the first time I'd been out of the country, but it was the first time I'd been to, like, not on vacation out of the country, so.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah, yeah.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Did you help with some of that work?

608:

Yeah, yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Oh.

608:

I got to... I was doing like... I was helping her dad, uh, install Microsoft on some computers.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

And then I also... She's a teacher.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So she taught English down there.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And so I sat in on a- an English class and kind of... I mean, we played, uh, Hangman.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I don't think you're supposed to call it Hangman anymore, but... (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

(laughs) Yeah.

608:

Down there, they didn't care, so we played Hangman. We just did some fun stuff like that.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. That's funny. It's funny you say that, 'cause I was playing Hangman with my son, and I'm like, "I- I can't call this Hangman, but I don't know what to call it." (laughs)

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

So... Um, uh, what about kind of what made you wanna join the Navy?

608:

[crosstalk 00:08:19].

Dr. Luning:

'Cause I guess that's happened in the last five years.

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

You decided to kind of join the Navy.

608:

Yeah. Yeah, I mean, like I said, I just wanted to be, uh, like, s- with a group of people, doing something. Well, first of all, I wanted to do something physical.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I was like, like, something physically challenging. Um, I do like to... One of the things I was thinking about is like, I like to- to, uh, learn new skills and stuff.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Especially like, phys- like, not physical skills per se, but, um, I don't know what that would be called. Um, just like, trying new things and- and learning. So I thought that would be good.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

A good place to do that. And I love being, uh, like, surrounded by, like, guys with a similar- similar mindset and- and motivation and, like, that kind of thing.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Um... I think, yeah, that's where I kind of fit in best or...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Do you feel like you had some of that experience here with people with a similar mindset?

608:

Uh, yeah, yeah. I did. Um, yeah. Especially, like, going through bootcamp and- and, uh, my initial prep that I went through. Uh, I think made some solid, uh, solid friends that I'll probably keep for- forever. And, um, yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Now did you go through bootcamp when, um, when they were doing like the special group that was doing training for SEALs?

608:

No.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

[crosstalk 00:09:56].

Dr. Luning:

So you went bootcamp to here to, like, the orientation phase?

608:

Yeah. We went through p-... So, my group-

Dr. Luning:

They've changed all the names. That's why I'm trying-

608:

Yeah. We were the last prep group that, uh, went to Great Lakes.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

Um, for- for prep.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

And my specific group, we were called Charlie group at the time.

Dr. Luning:

Got it.

608:

Uh, we were the last guys to kind of come in and join-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... the prep that was in progress. And, uh, a portion of us from that Charlie group... It was just alphabetical, I'm pretty sure.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Um, maybe like, 40 of us got, were pulled from that group to join the guys coming out here-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... to class up.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

And then, so the rest of my Charlie group is going, is about to class up, uh-

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

... this coming Monday.

Dr. Luning:

Got it.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Got it. Okay. Um, what about... How do you think... I- I should've asked this before kind of your life-shaping experience, maybe it's factored into, and just your life experience in general factored into your experience here at BUD/S?

608:

Um... Like, how, uh... I'm sorry, what?

Dr. Luning:

I- I guess... Well, let me ask it a little differently. Like, how- how kind of your life experiences, both in kind of high school and in college and the time you took to train, um, and even working as an engineer, how did that kind of factor into or impact your training? Whether it was training to- to come here or training while you were here.

608:

Um... Yeah. I don't think the- (laughs) the engineering or like the school carried over (laughs)-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah, yeah.

608:

... very- very... I mean, definitely having some maturity helped-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... with- with some things, I think. But obviously, I didn't make it all the way through, so it didn't- (laughs) didn't help enough. But, um, uh, I think the, uh, the best thing for, like, any- any amount of success that I had here, which wasn't a whole lot, but, um, was like, I was raised on, uh, a farm.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. Oh.

608:

And so I was always, you know, outdoors, uh, hunting and, you know, just being a- an outdoor kind of kid and... Uh, another thing that helped prepare me, which, you know, all this is... None of it helped prepare me enough to be successful. But (laughs) I do think that, uh, like I said, being raised like that and then also, uh, high school wrestling helped.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Um, that was a big, a big part, and... Um... I think having my, having my buddy who's also in kind of tell me, you know, what I needed to be doing and- and training-wise was a big help.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. I think, you know, one thing I'll say... Not an interview question. I think, you know, it's- it's a lot of success just to get here. So, you know. Just... (laughs)

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Um, how about, if you feel comfortable, do you wanna describe, will you describe your experience here at BUD/S?

608:

Yeah, yeah. Uh, I- I had a lot of fun at BUD/S. I- I think it was, uh... Like, it- it's... The whole thing, there's so many things you can look back on and think about how funny they were.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Like when- when you look back on them.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I mean, we were laughing like, every day. We were just laughing. Like, whether it was actually funny or it was like, it sucked so bad that it was funny, or whatever it was.

Dr. Luning:

(laughs) Yeah.

608:

But it was... I had a really, really good time. Um, and I- I don't think that... I mean, I wasn't a stellar performer on... So there's two types of evolutions kind of at BUD/S.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

It's like the... You- you probably... You might even already know this, so...

Dr. Luning:

It's okay.

608:

Okay.

Dr. Luning:

You can explain it. (laughs)

608:

Yeah, yeah. There's like the evolutions that you, uh, pass or fail. So that's like the swim, the run, the O-course.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And then there's the evolutions that are just like, you either secure them or you don't. And it really means nothing other than the people that secure them, uh, usually get some kind of a break or like, whatever while the other guys get remediated. (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

Yeah, yeah.

608:

So, you have to do something dumb or like, you know, go get, you know... Just sit in the water or whatever it is.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. (laughs)

608:

So, um, I- I never secured anything.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, of those evolutions. But I didn't, I didn't fail any of the, like, pass/fail stuff.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So... That was... I, like, I didn't feel as if I was, uh, like, had a crazy... I mean, BUD/S is obviously designed to be hard and like-

Dr. Luning:

Yep. (laughs)

608:

... all that stuff. And...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

The hardest part for me was probably just not- not getting enough sleep.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

'Cause you barely sleep. But, uh, um, yeah, I didn't think that any of it was, like, insurmountable as far as, um, like, being able to do it or whatever, so...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. It's funny you mentioned sleep. We were actually, as a research group, um, just talking about this this morning. And like, the lack of sleep and how that factors into things. How do you think that factored into kind of your- your performance here?

608:

Yeah. I think definitely, it- it's like, it's... Well, obviously it's designed that way, right?

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

'Cause there's definitely stuff that, like, I was talking about some of those evolutions that I didn't secure.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Only- only like a handful of guys might secure those s- like a ruck or... Only one boat crew probably-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... or two is gonna secure land portage or whatever.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Um, all that stuff, I think the hard part is all that stuff... Like if you were fresh, you would easily... not easily.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

But you would definitely think you would be able to, uh, be able to secure that or, you know-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

You're thinking to yourself like, "Man, I'm doing a ruck right now with 35 pounds." And you know, they're not... I mean, maybe he's running at a pretty fast pace. But it'll be like 8:30, 9 minute... like, it's not that fast, you know?

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

On a good day, probably I would think, you know, I could do that.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So, uh, when you're like... But when you're tired and you're- you're sore and stuff-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... y- and you can't do it, I think that's part of the...

Dr. Luning:

Absolutely.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Absolutely. Um, how about is there a time where you had to make a difficult decision during training? And what went through your mind as you made that decision?

608:

Yeah. Obviously when I quit-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... was I think the only time I had to make a difficult... Well, I mean, every dec-... Like, it was a difficult decision to decide, like, when I wake up at 4:00 AM and you have to go get wet, and it's like, (laughs) you're so cold and tired. And you're like... So that's like, difficult for like, 10 seconds, until you just are like, "Okay, go ahead and do it," you know?

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And then you do it and you're fine. Um, but the, yeah, the main difficult decision I had to make was, like, uh, when I quit, when I left.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Um, and the only reason I- I did that was because, uh, uh, my boat crew that I was with-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... um, they didn't, uh... I wasn't performing enough to keep up with-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... uh, like, what they were doing for the land portage thing.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, and I'm- I don't want to like make excuses or blame anybody or anything. But I, you know, at the end of the day, I couldn't perform the way they needed me to, I guess, so...

Dr. Luning:

Oh. Oh.

608:

I didn't like that feeling of like, not being the guy that they wanted to have in the team.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Even if it wasn't, like, get out. It was you weren't the guy that they were...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... like, wanted to have with them. So... Uh... Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Okay. Have you... And again, if you don't feel comfortable answering, you don't have to. Um, how are you feeling now? 'Cause we're... It was October, eight weeks ago or so.

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

Um, versus when you made that decision.

608:

Um, I- I think I... I think at first... I mean, obviously bummed out. Still bummed out.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And a little bit, you know... I- I don't think there's anything else I could've... like I don't regret making the decision that I made.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

In- in other words. Um, I'd love to come back and get another shot.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

If I could. 'Cause I think, uh, one thing was like, my original prep class that I went through with, um, I had... We had done some team- team evos.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, some like mock logs, mock pipes, they call them.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

They used to call them. Um, and I built like, a pretty good, uh, reputation-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... with my, with my boat crew back then. But like I said, I got, I got pulled from that Charlie group and thrown into-

Dr. Luning:

Got it.

608:

... uh, the other group.

Dr. Luning:

A new group.

608:

And I didn't really have a... I didn't have a- an- any reputation really-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... uh, coming in with them or any, uh, I don't know. What's it called? Like, you know, you build that kind of relationship with the guys.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, so we, you know, um, my boat crew was full of a lot of guys who had been there before who knew what was, like, going on.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And they had done it before and they kind of, they kn-... Uh, and some of them knew each other. But I was kind of like, uh-

Dr. Luning:

[crosstalk 00:19:09].

608:

Yeah. I was a little bit of the new guy.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I felt... Um, again, not to make any excuses or anything, but...

Dr. Luning:

Well, it- it's an interesting thing. And- and, um, in this study, uh... [inaudible 00:19:22] we've been doing this now since 2018. And we've found so many people. Really, it's- it's the coming back-

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

... that are... And- and this- this kind of dynamic of being gon- going through it (laughs), um, before.

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

And kind of having some of that sense of experience. So that leads actually to my next question. Would you consider coming back?

608:

Oh yeah. 100%.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

That's... I don't know that that's going to be possible.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

But I... Yeah, I- I had asked the guy yesterday when I got my job sheet like, what the best option would be to come back.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So... yeah, I would... I mean, I would definitely like to come back, but...

Dr. Luning:

Well, we've seen it. (laughs)

608:

Yeah. Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

And you've probably heard of people doing it, so-

608:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Luning:

We've definitely seen it.

608:

Yeah. I think the best route might be to go, to go officer.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And then get a... You only get one more shot. But I think that might be the most-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... the fastest way to get back here, is to put in officer package and try and come back, so...

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. How does that work for you? So you- you got your degree. So do you, do you go to OCS or...

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

I would go... I- I'm pretty sure. I'm not, uh, from like... I've looked at, looked into it a little bit.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

But I'm pretty sure you just... When you get to your next command, you talk to your, uh, leadership-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And- and they'll work with you on putting a package in. and then if you get accepted, you'll go to OCS, just like a-

Dr. Luning:

An- if you were coming right out [crosstalk 00:20:43].

608:

Yeah. [inaudible 00:20:45] comm and go to that. [inaudible 00:20:48].

Dr. Luning:

Okay. Okay. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold hope for it.

608:

Yeah. (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

Um, anything you would've done differently at BUD/S?

608:

Um, yeah. Definitely. Going back, I think there's a lot of small, small things that I could, like, I'm like, "Oh, man. If I..." I try not to think about it too much.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

'Cause it's like, coulda, woulda, shoulda. And, you know-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

You can't change it now, so, um... But yeah, definitely. And I think that's part of, like, coming back, you know those little things-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... uh, that you could do differently. (laughs)

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Uh...

608:

Uh... Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Can you think of any specific examples?

608:

Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, I remember this one guy in my boat crew, uh, I didn't know him at the time. But on the very first run of first phase, it's like the early morning. Everybody's all excited-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... and you know, it's like you go on your four-mile run. And I just like, I went all out. I went as hard as I possibly could.

Dr. Luning:

[crosstalk 00:21:43].

608:

I was hyped. I was there.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

You know, ready for, uh, ready for first phase. (laughs) And I think I PR’d my mile time by like almost a minute. (laughs) It's a great beach.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, around like a 27-something. And, uh, like, it wasn't until like a week later when we ran our second one, and we had like-

Dr. Luning:

You have to get better each time.

608:

We had like the worst... Well, yeah, and we had like the worst beach ever. So, uh, I think probably like, s- so many, so many people of the class failed it-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... that, um, they ended up giving us two extra minutes on it.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

So I didn't end up failing it.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I came in at like, 30, 32:02 or something.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And they gave us two extra minutes. You have to get a 32.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

So I came in at like, 32:02 or something, or 33:02. And then they gave us two extra minutes. So a lot of people ended up passing it.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

But there was this one guy who was in my boat crew who was a rollback. And, uh, the first run, I- I told you, I ran like as hard as I could. Ran like a 27.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

This guy ran like a 30- 30 minute, 30 second, ended up in the same position as all of us, passed.

Dr. Luning:

Yep.

608:

Didn't get remediated, you know? It's fine.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

But then on the next run, when it was like the crappy beach, that's when he like, tried his hardest and was able to... And he also passed that one. He actually ran faster than the first time.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So it was like, he definitely-

Dr. Luning:

So he looked good. (laughs)

608:

He knew going into that first run that like, oh, this is a great beach, you know? I've got my pacing down. Like-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And not to say that that's gonna... I'm not saying that that would save you or anything from, uh, you know... It's not gonna be whether you m- make it or not. But there's a lot of those little things, uh, like, when you go get under the boat, too. It's like, the rollbacks will- will definitely always go for... they won't go for that two spot. I don't know if you've, if you've heard about-

Dr. Luning:

The two spot's, what, like the middle one, right?

608:

Like the boat's shaped like that.

Dr. Luning:

Yep.

608:

And it's, so it's the lowest one.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah. Yeah.

608:

It's the lowest point. You kind of get the brunt of the weight. Uh, especially if you're... It's like the w-... If you're taller than somebody else, the shorter guy... If- if you're working together, if you're a boat crew, you can put the shorter guys in the two-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... and then the taller guys in the one and three and it kind of evens out the weight a little bit.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

You know? Um, and I think, uh, you can definitely set like a... You can make more of a, set a better impression of yourself if you, if you grab that one spot and on the very first one, you're like trucking forward-

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

... and not having any issues. I don't know, it's just little things like that that, I don't... You know, again, I don't think it's whether you make it or break or- or not. But a- all those little things help, for sure.

Dr. Luning:

Absolutely. Absolutely. What about were there any practices, physical, mental, spiritual, that you used to kind of push through challenges in general? Or if you used any of them here at BUD/S?

608:

Um, I mean, I'm- I'm Christian. So I- I pray.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Uh, and other than that, not really.

Dr. Luning:

Okay.

608:

I don't think of it as like a big part either. It's just something I've done.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

I just say nighttime prayers. But that's not like... I didn't really use any- any-

Dr. Luning:

Any mantras or anything like that you say to yourself?

608:

Yeah. My saying, yeah. I was just telling my wife about that the other day. My saying was, uh, is, uh, "Just go."

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So like in the morning when you wake up and you're like, uh, you don't wanna go get wet, 'cause awful.

Dr. Luning:

(laughs)

608:

So- so bad. (laughs) And, uh, you're just like, "Just go. Just go." And so you just- just start moving.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And- and then sooner or later, you're just already doing it and then you're done with it.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

And then it- it is what it is, so.

Dr. Luning:

Absolutely. How about how do you think this experience changed you as a person?

608:

Um...

Dr. Luning:

If at all.

608:

Yeah. I don't know. I don't know that it, that it- it did a whole lot.

Dr. Luning:

Oh.

608:

Um, when I first... When I first got out, I was like, "Oh, yeah, I gotta go back and I gotta, like, like, m-..." What I was thinking that I needed to work on, I was like, "I just gotta be more of like a, like a savage, like more, like, more about me."

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

More about myself. And just be like, you know, don't put up with an-... Like don't... You're not here to help anybody else or like, uh, but I just... I don't think that's really, like, me.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

So I don't think, I don't think it changed me.

Dr. Luning:

Yeah.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

Well, I think that's good. I think it's good to realize, especially if you do get to experience this again-

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

... to like, stay true to who you are.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

I think that's key.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

So... Any- anything I should've asked that I didn't ask that you think is worth sharing?

608:

(laughs)

Dr. Luning:

No?

608:

Uh, no. I don't-

Dr. Luning:

Okay. I'll let you off the hook.

608:

Yeah.

Dr. Luning:

I- I realize this was hard, and I- I really... I'll turn this off. Um...

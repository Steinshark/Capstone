Dr. Luning: So this is Celeste Raver Luning, it is January 6th, 2022 and I am here with participant number 662. So… first question, you were, what, what was your class.



662: 351.



Dr. Luning: 351. 



662: Yeah.



Dr. Luning: Was that your first class?



662: It was, yes.



Dr. Luning: Okay, um, and what phase did you leave in.



662: So I left in first phase on Day 2 week 1. 



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: So first Tuesday in the afternoon, yes.





Dr. Luning: Um and how long was that?



662: So that would have been, I believe it was October 12th.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: October 11th, was our uhh 1/1 day.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: So first day phase 1, um and then October 12th I believe…



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: Right around that time frame.



Dr. Luning: Great, do you know what’s next, where you’re heading next?



662: Yeah so as of right now, I’m in a kinda in limbo…



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: Kinda in a transitional period where I… am trying to redesignate to a new job within the Navy…



Dr. Luning: Yep.



662: And granted there’s only a handful of jobs you can do as an officer.



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: There's uh a process you have to, you have to go through so you have to apply for your top five jobs, hopefully get your first or second or whatever.



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: Um and then it's a little, it takes a little while for officers so I’m looking at hopefully applying in March.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: Um even though I’ve been here since, you know, this past summer.



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: Um, so. That’s the plan right now, is reapply, hopefully get picked up and go to Virginia Beach, for uh NIOBIC for the Naval Intelligence Officer…



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: uh Basic Course.



Dr. Luning: Um, so first, real question is tell me a little bit about your childhood…



662: Sure



Dr. Luning: Where you grew up…



662: Yeah so I…



Dr. Luning: Siblings…



662: So I was born in Eugene, Oregon



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: Both my parents went to University of Oregon. My dad played football there, my mom was just a regular student. So they met there. Um. They’re both originally from Portland or little suburbs of Portland.



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: Um. So when I was born, my older brother and I, we lived in Eugene for a little bit, then I moved back to Portland…



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: Um when I was two or three. Lived basically my entire childhood up until senior year of high school, then, when I left for college in Portland. And it was great. Oregon is an awesome state. You know, very outdoorsy, lots to do in the winter, lots to do in the summer. Um. Portland is a great city too. You know, very open. Everybody is like, very kind, uh



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: And you know, I was involved in sports, so I was doing stuff every season. I was ski, like skiing in the winter, you know. We, I grew up going to the Oregon coast…



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: So I’m familiar with the pacific ocean. Um, so basically had a really solid, really happy childhood for the most part and uh very normal.



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: Nothing too too crazy.



Dr. Luning: Siblings?



662: Yes, I have three other brothers, so



Dr. Luning: Three other brothers?



662: Yeah so (half laugh) there’s four boys, so



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: Um, I have an older brother. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: He lives in Montana currently.



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: Um, he’s 26. He’ll be 27 in February. Then there's myself. Uh and then I have a little brother who is a senior at Virginia Military institute.



Dr. Luning: Okay.

 

662: He’ll graduate and commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps, uh



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: And then I have a, uh, my youngest brother, is a sophomore at Syracuse University where he plays lacrosse.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: Yeah.



Dr. Luning: Okay. We’re at three. As the mom of three boys,



662: Yeah 



Dr. Luning: I kinda know what like this…



662: Oh my…



Dr. Luning: looks like



662: Yeah it’s chaos. Uh, yeah my mom’s always like people will ask her and she’ll be like yeah I have four boys and they’ll be like what the heck, and she’ll be like yeah don’t you see the halo on my head, so



Dr. Luning: Yeah yeah, it's a uh a loud



662: Yes, yeah, yeah



Dr. Luning: Sitting in the house. They’re younger still, but it’s loud.



662: Totally.



Dr. Luning: Ummm, what about sports. Did you play sports?



662: Yeah. So I…, like I said, I, ya know, my parents kinda threw me into everything.



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: Um, I was relatively timid with sports and stuff. I was unsure about, you know, football, track and field, and lacrosse, and basketball, but um, my friends would do em, so I would do em. You know…



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: I wasn’t like scared of them but, um I was never a huge fan of football, but my dad, so it was like, I’m gonna play football.



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: So I played, primarily it was football, uh basketball… lacrosse, and then a little bit of track and field. And I had done, you know, t-ball and baseball and stuff growing up, but once I uh, kinda got a little bit more serious about sports, it really kinda gravitated towards uh those couple ones. And then did that all the way through you know, 8th grade. Then went to high school obviously, and then I focused really on, really on doing football and lacrosse.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: Um, and then even more specific as I progressed through high school, uhhh. Or I guess in middle school, I decided I really wanted to try and pursue playing uh, collegiate lacrosse.



Dr. Luning: (inaudible)



662: And so that was my main focus. Not to say that I didn’t still participate in other spar, er, other sports in the fall and the winter just to stay active and do something because I did enjoy doing them. Um, but it started to shift more in middle school to realizing that that's what I wanted to do. So



Dr. Luning: Yeah that's interesting. I didn’t realize. I always think of lacrosse as an east coast sport.



662: Oh it is 110% an East Coast sport. It is not…



Dr. Luning: So it's unusual…



662: It is, especially in a state like Oregon…



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: Where it's not, ya know. It's on the up and up. Like my little brother plays at Syracuse University which is easily top 3 in the country every year…



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: Um. We have a lot of kids from the area now that are going and playing at big time Division 1 schools, really great D3 schools, D2, all over the place. The sport has grown exponentially since I was in middle school.



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: And even in high school, its leaps and bounds from when I was there. Um, so it's been awesome to see that because there's always little hidden gems every now and again from the east co… or west coast and um seeing kids from Utah, California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, go and play at some big east coast schools is lots of fun, super cool.



Dr. Luning: Yeah. Yeah it's funny. So when you said lacrosse, I was like Oregon, Lacrosse?



662: Yeah, no I, I, trust me I get that a lot. It's not uh, it's very, uh, very strange for sure.



Dr. Luning: But that's great. What about your personality? If you were to describe your personality in three traits, how you describe it?



662: Um, (pause), let me think. Uhhh, loyal is definitely one of them. Um, (pause), I would say persistent would probably be another one, and then uh (pause), I guess hard working, that could be a trait potentially.



Dr. Luning: Okay. Um. So talk about the last five years. So you obviously went to college. Talk through kinda that experience, last five years leading up to BUD/S.



662: Yeah, yeah so, graduated high school in 2015 and then I, I went to Loyola University in Maryland, in Baltimore.



Dr. Luning: I know exactly what, my oldest brother went there.



662: Oh, no kidding. Yeah. So we love Loyola, love the Hounds. So I went to Loyola for, uh for lacrosse actually.



Dr. Luning: Okay…



662: And had an unbelievable experience there athletically and academically it was a really good fit. So I got recruited by a couple other schools. The Naval Academy in general…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I really wanted to go to the Naval Academy, that was, when I was in like 5th or 6th grade, my grandpa was big on wanting a grandson to go there or someone in his family to go there.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And ya know, great school. I loved the idea of serving. Obviously, you know, the NSW pipeline is something that's big there. And then being able to play lacrosse at a division 1 level, get school paid for, and have a job right after school, you know, it was pretty



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: You know it was like awesome. Like, this is like the perfect fit. Um, so got recruited, did all that. Went on a couple visits, uh, and then when it came down to it, you know, the Naval Academy wasn’t the right fit for me at the time. I woulda had to do a year in Rhode Island at the Prep School…



Dr. Luning: Yeah, yeah…



662: And I was like, yeah I don’t really want to do that right now. Especially as a 16, 17 year old kid on a visit, you’re lookin at prep school, four years at the academy, on top of whatever the commitment is after the school…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: So, it was a lot at the time, and I was like, ya know what, that’s not gonna be my thing right now. Kinda put that on the back burner. My mom was like, ya know the military will always be there, college is something you only get once. And that kinda resonated with me a little bit. So ended up going 45 minutes down the road to Loyola. Um, and it honestly couldn’t have worked out any better lacrosse wise. Cuz, that, that was my life at the time. Ya know, that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to go to a school where lacrosse was the main focus, it was taken seriously, and it was something that people respected. And you know, Johns Hopkins is right down the road, Towson University is right up the road. There’s a bunch of really great D3 schools in Maryland, so Baltimore, and Maryland in general, I’m sure as you know and are familiar with, is like the hot bed for lacrosse



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: So, um, when I was there, freshman year it was great. We made it to the Final Four at the Division 1 level which was an awesome experience. I mean, I’m going from playing highschool lacrosse in Oregon to playing University of North Carolina in the Final Four, which was great, and to tie into a little later. There’s guys that played on that team that are now East Coast based SEALs, who I was able to kinda get in touch with and talk with. Um, and all throughout my sophomore, junior, senior year, we were top 5 in the country. Uh he whole time. Luckily, my junior and senior year, I was lucky enough to be elected as a captain. Um, for both years. Uh, the only junior to be selected as a captain. So out of the four, was myself and three other seniors. And then as a senior, my, obviously that second year. Um, and… up to a certain point my senior year, we were number 1 in the country at one point. So…



Dr. Luning: Wow…



662: So, it, ya know, it was a really great experience, playing in the NCAA tournament, all four years. Um, and then once it got to senior year, I was studying economics. It's, well, I didn’t really have a set idea going into Loyola of what I wanted to study.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I didn’t really know what majors there were to be completely honest with you. I really liked the idea of history. But then, I was like, I don’t really want to be a teacher, I don’t want to be a historian. And then it was like I don’t really know what you can do with a history degree other than that, so I didn't entertain that. Uh, but then, being on the East Coast, everybody’s so, like, caught up with getting to New York or Boston…



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: With like finance, and accounting, and all that stuff. So, I was like, okay maybe do that. But that wasn’t really my thing, like spreadsheets and TPS reports and that all that, all that whatever it is. You know, not my thing. Uh, so then I decided, well okay, economics is kinda a good blend of all that, plus it takes int, into account some other kinda, like, public relations, politics, all that good stuff. So that kinda fit my speed a little more. So uh, studied economics in the business school there. And then once senior year came around, um, you know, everyones applying for jobs and freaking about where they're gonna go after school, what they're gonna do, and I was like you know, I don't really have a desire to, to do this stuff. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I don't, I'm kinda just going through the motions with it. Some of it was interesting and um, but at the end of the day, that’s not what fires me up. That's not what I enjoy doing. So um, I started thinking about the military again. I had a friend, uh, the summer before I got back for uh, senior fall. He had mentioned OCS…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I didn’t know what it was at the time…



Dr. Luning: Okay…



662:Um, I just wasn’t even sure what that route was, post grad for the military. And so, he had kinda mentioned it, didn’t really think too much of it. And then I started to talk to him a little bit about it. And his dad was a Naval Academy grad who had played baseball there. Um, who's a blue and gold officer for the city of Portland. And, um, so, kinda started to think about that a little bit. And then, obviously, being in Baltimore, being so close to Annapolis, you know, you're kinda still, connected to that world a little bit. And I still kept a pretty good relationship with one of the coaches that recruited me there who knows a lot of SEALs, coached a lot of guys who became SEALs…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, and then luckily enough for me, my head coach, Charlie Toomey, he, um, coached at the prep school, coached at the Naval Academy…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Lives in Annapolis, so he's connected in that world. And, um, it just so happened that there two guys who were now on Team Four in Virginia, that I had played against in that semifinal game in 2015 or 2016 I guess at that point, who, one of them is from the Baltimore area, grew up five minutes from where I was going to school. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And so, I kinda heard through the grapevine, that he was doing this process. And then there was another guy from UVA who was doing the same thing. Um, got in touch with them, you know, through phone calls and all that stuff.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And then, was able to kinda, learn and train with Jake, the guy who I know, and so, got to kinda develop a relationship with him. Then met his roommate, came out and visited here in I think 2020, I think, December of 2020. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, and at that point, I had already kinda decided this was the process I wanted to do…

Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, and so I kinda started the OCS application process at the beginning of my senior year in like 2018 going into 2019. So, that is kinda where I was at. Um, I had wanted to, originally, potentially do it like right after school…



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: And, um, but, lacrosse being a spring sport, and, uh, it was a lot at the time. And I was like this process is taking forever. The recruiter I was working with wasn’t really doing a good job, I want to make sure I do this right. Not to mention we have our season in the spring that I want to focus on…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, so it was like, it was a little tough to balance training and playing a division 1 sport at the time. If I, if I could go back and do it, I would it, I would have done it obviously differently.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I did end up kinda falling out of love with lacrosse for a little bit. I think, cause it was kinda that time in my life for me to move on to something else. But I was also physically burning myself out. Like training for lacrosse, and I would work out on my own during the week, like in season, and just do kind of crazy dumb stuff that was, if anything, tearing me down than building me up…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: So, um, but, the 2019 season ended, um, and then, I, after a little bit we had a team trip. Then I moved home, and I was living in Portland for about a year and a half. So…



Dr. Luning: Okay…



662: Um, and so I was back in Portland with my mom and my dad, and, my brother, you know, my brothers were all away, so it was kinda just for a little bit. Um, obviously, going into the fall, like winter, cause my brothers were home from school obviously, but then they would go, er, go back to school. So, uh, yeah I was living at home, um, and then, that was also interesting, going from you know, college to living at home…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: I… was bought into the process. I was like, well OCS is what I’m gonna do. Wouldn’t really make sense for me to, A), live somewhere else. I knew kinda my timeline if, you know, hopefully if I got accepted…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Secondly, I didn’t, you know, I didn’t have any money to go live elsewhere. You know, I was playing a Division 1 sport which is a full time job and so I didn’t have the financial means to move elsewhere, er, and you know, train, and er, do whatever. Um, and so it just made sense to go home. So I went home and just worked part time stuff. I would work like three, four days a week, and then I would coach. So I would coach club, club lacrosse. And then I got hired on as the varsity offensive coordinator at um, the high school I went to for my freshman and sophomore year.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: And then I… and to backtrack a little bit, I went to a private Catholic high school freshman, sophomore year…



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: And then I transferred to a public high school for my junior, senior year. But I happened to know the guy who was the head coach there. He knew I was home, he kinda knew my timeline. What was going on. My little brother was a senior at the time. And so I was like might as well. It’d be a great experience, super cool to have my brother. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And so did that, and right before the season started, COVID hit. And so, literally, we were supposed to play on the following Tuesday, on Friday, they were like this is the last practice. And so, that was kinda what it was. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, but, that was a really, really cool experience. Lots of fun. I was kinda reluctant to do it at first cause, I was like you know, I’ve done the whole club coaching thing, and that's kinda hit or miss. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And, you know, some of the kids aren't super bought in, some of the parents are super tough to deal with. And I was like, well high school is gonna be way more serious, and I was, obviously like I was alluding to earlier, the level of high school lacrosse, is, grown way more, so it's way more competitive. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah..



662: Um, but then I started doing it, and it was a great group of kids, great group of seniors, great leadership on that team. And I think for both of us, for both parties, it was cool for them to have a coach who was fresh out of college and someone who they kinda knew on a personal level and had kinda been, like, grew up with, and seen play. And for me, it was awesome to kinda mold, or er try to…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: You know, some of these young guys, and kids that I knew, and that were friends with my brothers. So, so it was, it was rewarding in that sense. I really would have loved to have had the season…



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Um, but, you know it was great regardless.



Dr. Luning: Yeah. And when did, so when did you go to OCS?



662: So, that was, um, so I guess I started the process in the beginning of my senior year, just kinda getting talks going and all that stuff. And then, I had applied for uh, SOAS…



Dr. Luning: Okay…



662: So for SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection in, that would have been, last, so I woulda gone this past summer. So that was, last, in 2020, that was, I applied in like January of 2020.



Dr. Luning: And so you went in summer 2020 to SOAS?



662: Yeah, so I applied in January of 2020 and then whenever the results get back in March or April. And then we were all supposed to go. I was slated for the August block, and then COVID…



Dr. Luning: They didn’t do it. That's right



662: COVID, didn’t happen.



Dr. Luning: That's right, you didn’t…



662: They kept changing… 



Dr. Luning: Didn’t do it that summer.



662: They didn’t change it. Or they ended up having to change it. I was slated for the August block. You know, on Thursday, er, or like a couple weeks before we were all supposed to get down there. And now they were like okay, now we’re gonna change it to where we still have three blocks, but it's gonna be the one week, we can only do one week. It’s not gonna be two weeks. And then the Thursday before the first group of guys was supposed to fly out, that following Sunday, they were like we’re canceling it all together. And we had done the virtual interviews and stuff up to that point. I think we had done 5 or 6 each. Um, but you know, I mean, this is something that people had been talking about. I had anticipated doing. I really wanted to do. I was really looking forward to the opportunity to go and do it.



Dr. Luning: Oh…



662: And then all of a sudden, the rug just gets completely thrown out from under you. And that was extremely disheartening. That was extremely tough for sure. And you’re like, well now what? All I have to get picked up to be an officer as a potential SEAL candidate is five or six online interviews I’ve done, that have been maybe 20 minutes each, 15 minutes each. In an environment and in a job where physically, that is, you have to be a physical specimen to do it, obviously there is the mental and there is the personal aspect to it, but to make it through training, no one really cares, if you’re like, I mean yeah if you’re a bad person or not a nice guy, then that's gonna show. Physically, you can still be an ass and make it through. And so that was strange. And, also the fact that I was like, you know, I’ve been on a team my entire life. I work really well with other people. How are they going to see that? How are they going to know that I work well with other people, and that I can, like you know, lift other people up or they can do the same for me, and I, and I respond well to that and I don’t take criticism like terribly, or anything like that. So that, that, for me that was the biggest thing. Like, like I know I can tell you straight up, I am sure that there are people that did not get picked up that were way better physical competitors and physical performers than I was. That's just the case. But I think given my resume, and given the way that I was able to, you know, sell myself during the interviews, I do generally think that that’s a solid reason as to why I got picked up.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Not that I didn’t have good physical score, because I did. I exceeded the officer expectations on some things, but, for the most part, I do think it was a lot of my college experience, lacrosse, and obviously leadership experience, all through you know, middle school and high school, and at the collegiate Division 1 level.



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: And there’s guys that I was even in class with that went the enlisted route, that were like, yeah, I was in your SOASs block, I kinda remember you. And they made it to Hell Week. I dropped on Day 2. So, (laugh), it's like, it's really kinda interesting. And so, that was, looking back on it now, that was a very disheartening to not have SOAS to go through. Cause then maybe I would have been like, shoot, I am not prepared for this. Or I am not training properly for this. And now that I’ve either made it through SOAS and didn’t get picked up and or got picked up, I now have an idea of what I need to work on and what I need to do moving forward. Whereas I think the reason why you’ve seen a lot of officers drop in 349, 350, 351, is because none of us had that physical thing in SOAS that we could go and do, that we could go an see.



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: Where I think if, I think if we all were in the same boat and we all went and somehow ended up that we’re all here, I, I mean I don’t know about myself but I guarantee you there’s probably a handful of other officers that would not be in the same boat that I’m in. And potentially myself as well. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah



662: Because if I had that experience, knowing myself and knowing my work, work ethic, it would have been different for sure.



Dr. Luning: So just, um, so, cause I don’t know the logistics, so with OCS, you, so you go to SOAS and then they say…



662: Yeah, right



Dr. Luning: You’re a SEAL select



662: Yes…



Dr. Luning: And then you go to OCS.



662: SOAS is all the Naval Academy guys, ROTC, uh, Army, uh Air Force guys, and people like myself straight off the street as a civilian to try and go commission as an officer, so, the pipeline would have been, the timeline would have been, go to SOAS in the summer, hear back in like October as to where or not you got picked up. And then it's kinda random when you get sent to OCS.



Dr. Luning: Oh…



662: So I heard back in October and I went in, um, I went at the end of February to start my 2 week quarantine in Rhode Island.



Dr. Luning: Okay



662: And then I think March 9th, was the day I started like, Day 1 of OCS.



Dr. Luning: And then OCS, knowing though, you’re uh…



662: Yes, so you’re designated as a SEAL candidate. There’s only like, the majority of the classes at OCS is SWO, Special Warfare Officer, Pilot, NFO, um, and so there’s only a handful of guys that go through, but I was in a class, luckily, some of my best friends now, the Irwin brothers who I live with and um, some of the other guys, I was in a class with, there were 5 of us, so there were six total. Um, and like one of the classes, there was one guy who went in by himself. Another class had like four guys. So it ranges, it varies. And then sometime you’re intermixed with like prior enlisted SEALs who are commissioning as an O-1…



Dr. Luning: Okay…



662: So they already gone through BUD/S, they’ve deployed. 



Dr. Luning: So they just have to go to OCS.



662: Yes exactly. Then they go to the JOTC, training and start kinda their career as a JO in the Teams.



Dr. Luning: But then, in OCS, you’re mixed in with everyone else. 



662: Everybody, yeah, yeah, so, yeah, I showed up, um, we did our quarantine, then we started. And every class is, I’ll say from 100 to 110 people. And then you usually finish with 80 or 90.



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: It just kinda depends on the class. But myself and the five other SEAL candidates we were with, we were with all the other SWOs, NFOs, Pilots, Cryptos, intelligence officers…



Dr. Luning: Okay.



662: You know, all people in the same boat, and all, you know, we, you know, OCS is a place where prior enlisted go to get their commission. But for the most part, it's all kids and people my age, 23, 24, 25, right out of college, year and a half, two years out of college, uh, that are there doing that so, you know, nothing too, too crazy. So.



Dr. Luning: So, um, anything in, kind of, prior to coming to BUD/S, you’d say is life shaping or crucible type of experience?



662: Yeah, I would definitely say, um, I think it… the lacrosse experience at Loyola had so much, it, it gave me a lot of confidence moving forward. Only, not only in my four years, but also specifically in my freshman year, I was one of three freshmen to really, only, to play that year out of a class of 15. You know, we were a very junior, senior heavy team, with a lot of really, really great players. Um, and, going into freshman year, I got recruited as an offensive player and they were sticking me in defensive middie, which you know, doesn’t get to see the opposite side of the ball as much. And I remember, bout, five or six games into the season, I went up to my coach and I kinda took time out of my day to go up to him, and be like, listen, something’s not going right. I, I’m a little frustrated cause I know I can contribute and I know I can help to this team, and I know you guys know that as well, but something’s not clicking right now. And so, being kinda able to do that on my own, kinda build confidence a little bit. And then the first game I play offense against is you know Duke, which is like powerhouse, top 5 all time lacrosse schools. Um, and, so its like little things like that that definitely helped for sure. Kinda made me realize that, like, okay, I’m not, not really in Oregon anymore. I’m kinda doing, you know, big boy stuff. And this is stuff that, you know, other people definitely wish they could be doing. So I was very grateful for those experiences and those opportunities. Um, so lacrosse was definitely a big thing. Um, just little, small little victories, I guess you could say here and there. But lots of, lots of defeats as well. Lots of losses. You know, I remember senior year, we were playing Towson. Mid week game, which is like, you know huge rivalry, in the, in the Baltimore area. And huge, like old school lacrosse rivalry that everybody knows. Um, and we were the number one team in the country at that point. And I, probably had the worst game of my collegiate career. Played absolutely terribly. And you know, I was more of a liability than an asset to my team during the game. And that was just, you know, not fun at all. That was a terrible experience. Super thankful that it happened obviously, you know, hindsight is 20/20 and I’m glad that I could reflect on that and look back on it and be like okay, well, what did I do leading up until the game that kinda allowed me to, you know, perform, poorly or what could I have done differently type thing. So, um, you know, there's that. And I would also say, uh, so when I moved home, my dad had been kinda dealing with some alcohol issues. He had been, uh, working at a, you know, really well paying, like medical sales job for like a really long time. Got let go at a time when, you know, my older brother was in private high school. I was about to start high school. So it was a very expensive time for my family and I. And then next thing, you know, he started his own business. Which is great, but then he gets sued by one of his partners. A family friend who we've known for like forever. So you know, all of our money, all of our savings goes into litigations and lawyers and lawsuits and all this stuff. And then nothing comes of it. So it's like, there was then. And then, luckily, I was away for four years. So I would come home in the summer for three months and you know, a month in the winter and not really think too much of it. I wouldn’t really see it. But, my mom and my littlest brother were home and they kinda bore the brunt of it. And then those roles kinda switched. So when I moved back in 2019, June of 2019, I kinda started to see it. I was aware of it. And then that following August we had, you know and intervention and we sent him to rehab, and, you know he was only there for I think 30 days. Which is, you know, not anywhere close to where he needed to be. And then, he ultimately ended up relapsing, um, and he was kinda being shady, not really how he was supposed to be acting. He was being strage. We could clearly tell that there was somethin going on. Cause he would always kinda go on like trips and like disappear and he would come back. And we were like alright, this is kinda messed up. We don’t know what's going on. Um, and so, I would say, you know, during this whole process, I’m working part time, I’m home, I’m seeing, like all my friends are out doing their own thing. They’re living in other cities. You know, life’s great. Um, I’m home in Portland and my mom and I find my dad in a hotel and he’s drunk and he's just like doing his own thing. I ask him to come home. He doesn’t want to come home. And that was in October of 20. And I haven’t spoken to him since.



Dr. Luning: Wow

662: Yeah so like, that was definitely strage for sure. Cause, like I mean, whole attachment theory. Those are your parents. That's what you’ve know your entire life and then all of a sudden that gets like stripped away. Um, and then on top of that, my dad wasn’t doing well financially. He didn't have any money. My mom wasn’t really working. She had been a stay at home mom for a while. So, you know, I was making a little bit of money part time. And my brothers were gone. My oldest brother was in another state and all over the place. And so I was having to help pay rent and do stuff and, kinda help out financially a little bit, which you know, as a kid right out of college who doesn’t have any money, thats now having to pay $3000 a month every now and again for rent, it's like, you know, that kinda sucks. Especially with the desire to move somewhere else and like live somewhere else and kinda start my own thing, um, so that was definitely, you know, a bit of a strange adjustment period. And it's, you know, it's still a little strange. But I'd rather have it be, I'd be going through it now as a 23, 24, 25 year old then as uh you know, like a kid. Cause now its like, I can form my own opinions, I have an idea of what's going on. And I'm not in the dark really about anything so to speak. Um, and I can kinda have, you know, my head about me if that makes sense. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah that makes sense…



662: So… yeah that's kinda ongoing and you know, a work in progress. So that's, uh, kinda, like, he didn’t even really know when I was at OCS, when I graduated, when I moved out here. He, he had heard that I had dropped from training. My brother had told him at some point. But I, you know, I didn’t speak to him directly, so… yeah.



Dr. Luning: So how did all, kinda these experiences you talked about play into your training, impact your training?



662: Yeah, so, I mean, I, a lot of what I had done for training was, kinda word of mouth from other people. You can, you can look up, everybody knows how to train for the PST, which is the basic test to get in. But when you get here, none of that matters at all. So, a lot of what I had picked up on and what I had done to train and prepare was word of mouth from guys who were doing OCS who had been through SOAS, who kinda knew what they were doing for the most part and were now in BUD/S. And, you know I’d tried to reach out and talk to as many people as I could and luckily for me, the lacrosse world is so small and there happens to be a weird number of lacrosse guys that…



Dr. Luning: Yes, yes there are



662: Are within the SEAL community so it, you know, I’m like hey you know, so and so, like, you played at Carolina. You know this guy? Yeah I know this guy. How do you know em? Em, like, oh I’m like best friends with him or whatever. So it was a lot of that which is great. Um, and not once did I have one person, you know, not, you know, wanna share their story with me or whatever. So, it was, it was really great. I wouldn’t have trained that part of the process. Because I came into contact with some awesome people. Some amazing human beings, um, and so, just gettin, kind of taking bits and pieces from what they were saying, you know I, uh, lots of running, um, not as much as I think I should have been doing. And again, I’m kinda saying this as like in retrospect, you know, I was running anywhere from 25 to maybe 35 miles a week, swimming 2 or 3 times a week with fins, without fins, um, you know, calisthenics, working in the gym, all that kinda stuff for the most part. Um, but, you know, it was everyday for at least two to four hours. You know, and I was working part time at home because I wanted to focus on this. So, I would have entire days where I can just kinda go about my business and train how I wanted to and do what I wanted to. Um, but now, obviously being in it, and having experienced a little bit, I definitely look back at myself a year and a half, two years ago, and I’m like, shoulda done things a little differently for sure. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah, just train differently?



662: Trained way differently. Um, so I mean, its, first of all its extremely hard to replicate what you do here, when you’re well fed, you’re not sleep deprived, you’re warm, and it's like in the summer and you’re home. You know? Um, not to mention, a lot of these guys were in like programs or they, you know, work out with SEA… I was kinda like by myself, I was doing my own thing. Which is fine, I didn’t mind that. But I definitely would have, I think, reached out to maybe, you know, a former SEAL or a current SEAL and been like, I want you to program some workouts for me. And not that I didn’t have workouts available to me, I kinda took bits and pieces and formulated my own thing. Um, but now, being able to experience what I did, I just wasn’t necessarily ready for the sheer volume of what it was, cause, I mean, I, I would run, you know probably my longest run was anywhere from 8 to 10 miles. Which is a lot. I would run all the time. But then, you get here and it's like, okay well you go from a run to a ruck, to running with a boat on your head, which I had never done. Or I’ve never done log PT before, I’ve never done hot laps where you’re carrying a log up the dune and so it was all pretty new and foreign to me. Um, so, absolutely would have trained way different. Um, yeah, I, I, but, you know hindsight is 20/20, and that just, it is what it is.



Dr. Luning: So why the Navy, and why SEALs in particular?



662: So I, like I said, my infatuation with the Navy, in, and kinda the Naval Academy started in like middle school. Um, you know, I come from a pretty conservative family for the most part, so the idea of serving was something I always potentially wanted to do, um and as I got older and started to formulate my own opinions, I was like this is definitely something I could see myself doing. In terms of what capacity that would have been, I wasn't entirely sure. But then, you know, as a young kid, you see all this stuff on, in, everything is now out in the open about SEALs and NSW and it was like wow, that looks really cool. Like that looks like some stuff that I would definitely like to do. Um, you know, I was always extremely athletic and like a top performer athletically in all the sports I was in growing up. I was a team captain on like all those teams growing up. (Stutters), like and also obviously in high school and uh college as well. I was a captain on both the high school football and lacrosse team. Um, and, kids kinda knew me as such and I kinda had that reputation and I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed being in a leadership position. I enjoyed working with people, like being on a team and being able to use my physical attributes to, I guess accomplish a goal for the most part. Um, and so, when I kinda realized that the whole businessworld thing wasn’t really for me, and I started to realize, okay well, the military is still an option. And then SEALs came back around and I started thinking about it a little bit. And it was like, okay, well physically, I feel like I stack up really well. And these guys get to workout for a living. That's what I’ve been doing my entire life so far. They’re goal driven people, extremely smart, um, you know, I was a Dean’s list academically, Academic-All American at Loyola. You know, school, it wasn’t my best thing but I enjoyed it. I enjoy learning. I enjoyed being able to have different scenarios play out in front of me and being able to kinda problem solve a little bit. Um, and then, I guess thirdly, would be the team aspect of it. As an, as an officer, you know, to boil it down basically, you are a team captain for the most part. So, you’re in charge of people, you do have a little bit more uh, job authority and a little bit more responsibility than someone on the enlisted side. And obviously I understand it's a little different in NSW, it's a little bit, you know, the line between enlisted and officer, which, which I enjoy, I, I like that a lot, versus like the kinda regular Navy. Or from stories I’ve heard and stuff I’ve heard. And so I was like this seems like the perfect fit. And then, obviously there are a lot of guys who I know who played lacrosse or who I played against who were doing this process, and so I was like, well hell, then I’m like that dude. I, I train like that dude, I’ve played like that guy. We have similar backgrounds. So it just kinda made sense for me to try and do this and explore this opportunity. Um, and then once I kinda started to think about it, it clicked, and I was like, there's nothing else I could see myself doing right now. And so that was, yeah, I guess, kind of the thought process behind that. And then obviously, you can’t be a SEAL in the Army. So, you know, the Navy made sense. And, I had wanted to do Naval Academy, and obviously being back in Maryland, that's kinda the world there. Um, but then, with the SEALs, there like only one place you can come and do it. So that was kind of the thought process for sure.



Dr. Luning: So, talk to me about your experience here at BUD/S.



662: Yeah, so, it was, uh, I got here in, I gra-, I commissioned and graduated from OCS in June, I moved out here in July. And, at that point, we weren’t really doing anything. I had checked in a little closer to the beginning of August. And that's when I had started, I think it's something else now, but it was PTRR. Which is like the, whatever, preliminary, if you’re injured and you get rolled back, you’re kinda in that world. So I started that, and you know, that a really dumbed down, really watered down version of BUD/S. But it was good. I’m glad I had a lot of that of that time to come and do it. Because I could not imagine being a guy on the enlisted side, flying in on Friday and then going on Monday. Like that would be so overwhelming for sure. So I was really, really fortunate to have that time to come down, you know, I was living at my house, drive here, work out, do my thing. Um, so it was good to get a lay of the land, kind of get an idea what to expect, how to take care of my gear, how to interact with the Instructor Cadre. All that kinda stuff. Uh, but then you’re in it for a little bit, and you get kinda, I think I just got a little complacent, a little comfortable. Cause like, okay I’m doing well on the swim, like I gotta practice at the O-Course. But my run’s okay. But other than that, like, you know, it is what it is. So, there was that. Um, and, obviously, if I had known a little better, I would have done some more stuff, prepared a little differently. Uh, and then once, once, uh, Basic Orientation or BO rolled around, it was still, it was a continuation of the same thing. Like yeah it was a little bit more ramped up, it was a little more serious for sure, but it was still three weeks of extremely watered down, you know, kinda 5 miles an hour, walk before you can run type of thing. Um, and again, you're like kinda learning how to do things, like log PT and running with boats, and all that stuff. And I, that second week I think is when we did log PT and that's when it kinda hit me like, uh okay, uh this is pretty tough. Cause, I, I had a tough time on the log. I don’t know what it was, but I just had a really difficult time with that evolution in general. I would find that, you know, I was short of breath. My lower back would give out quite easily. Walking up the dune and down the dune, I would get shaky legs and I would literally like fall off the log. And so, you know, my first experience with that, especially as an officer coming in whose, at the time, you know, I was finishing, you know pretty well on the runs, doin well on the O-Course, you know, top 5 on the swims, you know, I was like, I can’t this is weird. What is happening? And so, I, you know, and we did land portage and all that kinda stuff. And that was all fine. And then, once, you know, the first day hit, it was like, just, zero to a 100 miles an hour. Super super quick. Um, which is to be expected obviously. You know, the morning stuff wasn’t too bad, um, it was a lot, don’t get me wrong. And obviously there were things I probably could have improved on. But for the most part, the first half of the day, I was like, okay, this was to be expected. It was tough, but we got through that first part. Um, and then we did logs in the afternoon of Monday. And then that was bad. Because I also had another terrible showing. Um, same type of thing. Short of breath, not able to keep up. Not doing super well. Um, and again, this was my second time doing logs, like ever. So, it was like, its, it was tough. It sucked. And obviously as an officer, getting singled out by the Instructor Cadre en, on Day 2, or on Day 1 and not being able to perform, it's like, well, maybe logs isn’t my thing but at least we have land portage tomorrow. We’ll be like fine, we'll do all that stuff. You know, it's another day. So, but then at the end of Day 1, I’m the most sore I’ve ever been in my entire life and, you know, I feel like every step I take, I feel like my quads are gonna like snap off my legs. Um, and, again, I think that was just part of preparation and not really preparing for evolutions like log PT. Because it's not that I haven’t trained hard in the past, or done difficult things. I think it was just the way in which I went about it could have been a little better. Um, and so, you know, going to bed that night, you’re sore. And you’re waking up and it's like really tough to walk. And it's like wow, I’m more sore than anything I have ever done. And it is the morning of Day 2 and we haven't really even done anything yet. 



Dr. Luning: Yeah…



662: And so, you know, that was really starting to sink and sit in with me a little bit. And I was like, okay well, I gotta be able to like perform a little bit today, and, and do this, and I forget, what did we do in the morning? Um, we just had like pool stuff in the morning. You know, pretty basic, nothing too crazy. And then we ended up doing the O-Course in the afternoon after lunch and that, that was also another realization. Cause, you’re beat down, you’re sleep deprived, you know, I’m sore as heck, and I remember getting on the parallel bars on the beginning and being like wow this is gonna be tough. Cause, you know, healthy, I was able to run the O-Course in less than 7 minutes and 30 seconds. Which is fast. And, then, going into it, it was like wow, okay, I’m little sore, I, you know, going up the cargo net, I’m like far, almost falling off. I don’t have grip strength. And then going to like the Dirty Name, I fail it on like the first time. Which like, I’ve never really failed at that before. So that was also a realization, it was kinda like, this was, this is getting pretty tough. And then, we went immediately from that into land portage. And you know, running with a boat on your head. It's like you either, you kinda just, you either do it or you don't. And I made it down a little ways. But I was struggling. I was not doing super well. And again, as an officer, especially in a boat crew of 7 guys, you can’t be that guy. Um, and I knew that. And so we made it down. I was struggling big time. Wasn’t having an awesome time doing it. My legs were just crushed. You know, not feeling super great. And so, I think once that physically started to set in, I think mentally it kinda started to happen right after that. Cause I was like, okay, well if this, this is Day 2, what's it gonna be like you know, during Hell Week when I’ve got the boat on my head 98% of the time I’m up. Like that's gonna be extremely tough. And so made it down. And then, the big thing was I’m struggling and I’m, I’m a liability to the guys in my boat crew right now. I’m a liability to the class, the Instructor Cadre, like obviously, if they, but we were in the back so there was no one really there. But I’m like if they saw me right now, it’d be bad. It’d be a bad story for sure. Um, then it started to creep in a little bit. And I was like, you know what, I, this might not be for me like I thought it would be. I’m not doing well physically, you know, I’m, I’m not a performer like I thought I would be at this stage of the game. And granted it was still early. But, I was like, if I can’t do it now, I’m not gonna be able to do it later down the road. And so, at that point I decided to quit. To DOR. Um, and, yeah. That's kinda where it was. But overall, it was an interesting experience. I wouldn’t change it for the world. Like obviously I would go back and train differently, and have a different result. But at the end of the day, there’s so few people that get the opportunity to come here, and I, so grateful to be here. And I remember talking to my mom in September when it was like 9/11 and calling her and crying on the phone and being like I have the opportunity to be here and be in like SEAL training. How amazing is that? And so, that was like an awesome experience for sure. But like, just the people I’ve come in contact with. Whether that be back in Portland or here through this process. I would do it 100 times over and have the same result just to be touched by those people and to make those connections. Uh so, yeah.



Dr. Luning: So, tell me a little bit about the dynamic of Class 351. We’ve heard it was an interesting dynamic.



662: Yeah, yeah, how so? What did you hear?



Dr. Luning: You tell me about it…



662: Okay, so, um, honestly I, at the start, I thought we had a really good class. There were a lot of really good guys that were in PTRR with myself and some of the other officers that we had all kinda gotten to know. And so I was like, okay I have a good rapport and a good relationship with a lot of the enlisted guys that are coming in. Um, and, so, for the most part, we were all on the same page. We had heard that the class before us was a very cut throat, very dog eat dog. Like guys telling other guys to quit and forcing other people to quit. Which I understand happens and I’ve seen it. But, we were all on the, as officers, we were all on the same page. We’re like we are not gonna do that. That's, you know, we’re not really, the process is gonna do that, none of us are necessarily right now, in the position to do that. So were just gonna kinda try and be like the big brother in this situation. So, started out, everything was relatively fine. We had, uh, we, you know, we had an I, en um OIC who had been in Phase before. So he was in 349 I believe and then rolled back for 351. Great guy. He was a, uh, surface warfare officer prior to being here. Um, and, coming in contact with some surface warfare officers, you can kinda tell there's a little bit of an, I don’t know, there, there’s like an attitude kind of dynamic that they have that I, I don’t really, or at least that he kinda had that I was not on board with. I think it, I don’t know his past athletic history, but it was obvious that physic, cause you know, I played college sports, my roommates, they were, they played lacrosse as well. One of the other guys was a rower. Um, so it was like kinda obvious that he wasn't really sure how to interact with people in a team environment for the most part. But he did a great job. I think he was the right guy for the job at the time, cause you kinda need someone to be a hard ass, be kind of a dick head at times. Cause you got kids that are 18, 19 coming in and this is their first kinda time away from home and it's, you know, it's not an environment where you wanna be joking around. And so I think he did a good job. Um, and, I, our understanding as officers coming in, that we were all, we had all had a huge target on our back. Not only for being officers, but especially because we were Zoom Officers or Zoom O’s as the term likes to be tossed around. So we had all been to virtual SOAS, no physical testing or evaluation done prior to here, so we’re all showing up basically in the same boat that the enlisted guys are showing up in, which is like, not the case in, you know, three hundred and forty whatever classes prior. So we were like a new experiment also for the most part. And, I didn’t necessarily get a whole lot of that, you know for the two days I was in, but, you know, everyone was treated the same for the most part. So, yeah, I guess it was, uh, (sigh), you know, I thought the dynamic of the officers and enlisted, it, it was pretty healthy. It wasn't anything too insane. It's not like they couldn’t talk to us as regular people because they could. And I know that I could converse with a lot of the enlisted guys as, you know, they're the same age I am. They’re the same experience I am. The only difference, I’ve got this thing on my uniform versus them not having it. Um, so, for the most part, yeah. I think it was as a class dynam, dynamic, it was, I think everybody got along relatively well with each other. Obviously you throw the Instructor Cadre in there a little bit and it changes the dynamic, um, and what I understand and what I experienced, they’re tough for sure. I like, obviously I don’t have too much ground to speak on given the time in which I was in training, but, I mean, from what I’ve heard, there were guys that had rolled back that were in 3-4 whatever, five, six classes before and that got injured are now on our class, en, you know, throughout the couple weeks, I had head from those guys, they were like, yeah the stuff we’re doing now is like a little different, a little harder than that we were doing in prior classes. So, I don’t know, I kinda take that with a grain of salt but I do kind of think that that dynamic shifted a little bit. I don’t necessarily know why. But I mean, you look at our class, we had 90 drops in the first week, which, from what I heard, is the most ever.



Dr. Luning: Yeah, that’s pretty, it was pretty surprising then.



662: Not even necessarily in a winter class, like yeah it was getting colder, but 90 people dropping in the first week? And you just had in 51, or in 50, you had whatever it was, 20 or 25 guys secure Hell Week. But in 49, you had like 50, 60 dudes. So how does it, you know? It's interesting how that kinda works out. Um, so I don’t know if that answers your question or not…



Dr. Luning: Yes, no, that's great. Um, how about anything you would have done differently in BUD/S?



662: Like in BUD/S?



Dr. Luning: Yeah.



662: Um, (sigh), again, I think it's uh, make it though. I think it's a game of preparation. In no way shape or form am I mentally weak person. I don’t think that at all. I don’t think that's what got me. I think physical preparation’s what got me. And obviously mentally after that kinda started to set in, and I was like well this isn’t for me and that's, you know, it is what it is. Um, so I think to back track maybe, preparing, I would have done things differently. But at the end of the day, we’re in a unique situation where COVID happened and none of us could, none of us could predict that we wouldn’t go to training or SOAS or anything like that. So, you know, I think we’re, we’re kinda in a way, some type of sacrificial lamb almost, to, so they could be like we didn’t have SOASs this past fiscal year and look at what happened. We have an unusual amount of officers drop. None of them or there's only a couple of them that's performing well versus the enlisted guys. Which from my understandings not supposed to be the case. Um, but, in BUD/S, um, I don’t know. It would have been nice to physically been able to stay in it a little longer. Again, I was in, only in it for two days. But, you know, one of the things I really enjoyed about it was the relationship that I had with the enlisted guys. And I’ll see guys now and about downtown San Diego or the, you know, they’ll come over and hang out at our house. They want to come over and watch football or whatever. And, it kinda sucks to hear from them after the fact because they’re like you were a really good officer. We really enjoyed having you. And you, you were probably the officer that I respected the most. And hearing that, and only being in it for two days, and it's like, damn, that sucks. Because that's ultimately what I want to do is lead men and lead men into combat. And you know, being able to have that kinda respect from those people. You know, it's a big thing for me. You know, Some people might not. I can guarantee you there's probably some officers in our class that that probably doesn't resonate with them as well, but I, I understand the gravity of that and what comes with that. And what comes with the territory of being an officer and the job itself. So that was definitely kinda, kinda tough to hear. But with that being said, I think I did a good job of you know, kind of being fairly middle ground, where I could step up and say something, but at the same time, I’m gonna be your friend. You know, I’m not gonna be your best friend, but you can at least come to me and do that. So I was happy about that part of it for the most part.



Dr. Luning: And I don’t know what, or if it's even possible for officers, but if you were given the opportunity, would you try to come back and do this again?



662: I, I think so. Its, not, it's not possible for officers to come back obviously. But you know I would. Right now, I’m a little burnt out with it if I’m being completely honest. Like, I, you know, grew up with going from one sport to the next and then like in season and then in high school, preparing for high school lacrosse, which I was doing all the time. And then coll… going from high school to preparing for a top Division 1 college to okay well now I’m done with Division 1 lacrosse, now I’m gonna try and train for SEALs. So it's been, you know, back to back to back to back kinda doing stuff. So now's kinda the first time in my life where I’ve been able to take a step back a little bit and just kinda sigh of relief and just slow down. Um, so yeah, obviously SEALs is not an option. But I do know I’m only 25. I’m young. So there's other potential special forces, you know, qualifications and trainings down the road that I could potentially transfer to and apply for. Do I want to do that right now? No, not necessarily. One, because physically, I’m not there, um and then secondly, it's just the mental thing. I don't have necessarily a desire to do it right now and as I kinda shift into this process and learn about the other opportunities that are out there, it's just like okay well some of those are cool and they definitely do fit kinda my personality and what I’ve, what I would have liked to do in a certain aspect and plus it would be a good avenue into other things, whether that be stay in the military or go on the civilian side of it. So, to answer your question, yes I would like to come back. Would I be able to? No, but um, you know, I now take. And I have no doubt this is by far the hardest military training in the world. You don’t run with a boat on your head at SFAS. You don’t, you don’t get wet and sandy and surf torture at Ranger School. You know, it's, I think having a little bit of, a little taste of that is definitely something that could help me in the future. So…



Dr. Luning: Um, any practices, physical, mental, spiritual, that you do to get through challenging things?



662: Um, I think it kinda depends. Again, like, the environment here and what you do here is so different than being on a lacrosse field or playing football or basketball. So like, with lacrosse, it's something I have been doing my entire life and I was comfortable with it. Um, I was good at it and I had experience I could fall back on and be like okay we’ve been down by 5 points before, but we’ve come back and we know how to do it and there's a way to do it. And I would kind of regiment it in that way. Um, I also tried to make it so that physically I could prepare myself in a way that I could always fall back on that and not really need to think about it. Um, whereas here, it was moreso, just coming into the idea where, okay there are guys that, you know, are straight out of high school that can do this. I’m a Division 1 athlete that's been playing lacrosse and has been in sports for super, super long, so it's like, on paper, I fit the mold for the most part. Um, but I think for the, for that, it was moreso, like, you know, just thinking other people have done this, there is no reason as to why I, I can't do it. Um, and obviously once push came to shove, I wasn’t able to do it. Which is completely fine, it happens obviously. But that, I guess that would be kinda the big thing I guess. But then also, thinking about all the people that, that got me here and are expecting me to follow through with this. And obviously they, they tell you, like if you don’t make it, its fine. It is what it is. But you don't, you don't wanna let them down. And I've never been one to try and do that or want to do that. So that, that was also one of the big things as well.



Dr. Luning: So last question, how did this experience change you as a person? If at all?



662: Yeah, I think uh… I mean, it's still kind of fresh for the most part. I definitely think that I've grown in the sense that I've realized that I, um, you know, I'm someone, I've had it really, like relatively easy in my life so far up to this point. Like everythings kinda worked out for the most part. Um not that I have failed or lost in the past. I have, but you know, it was like with, uh, sports. So something I was used to, wasn’t able to do it. And now it's like well this is a career thing. This is something that has, you know I, had hopefully thought about forming my life around. And then all of a sudden, that gets pulled right from under you. And I knew that 100%, don't get me wrong. I knew that was the reality of it. Um, obviously I thought things were gonna be going differently. Um, but I think it just kinda showed one, I wasn't as physically strong as I thought I was, two mentally, I probably could have been a little better head space just because of some other outside things and just give the situation at the time during training. Uh, and then, I guess, another one would be, just kinda realizing that there's always stuff to improve on. And not that I didn't know that, but now it's like, I kinda need to shift my focus from one thing into another thing and just kinda start this whole process over again with a completely different school of thought and ideology. So there's always things to learn and, and be aware of. Um, but, again as I kinda said earlier, I wouldn't trade this process for anything. Like it was an honor to be in training here. I, I do think that this is by far, in a way, the hardest military training in the world. I wouldn't change the experience for that. And none of my friends would have come and do it. And like, no shot. There’s people that, 50 years down the road, awww, I wish I had done that. It's like, well I did and I can at least hang my hat on that and it's like yeah it didn't work out but life goes on. But at least this didn't work out but I can take the experience that I've learned here and apply it forward and then also be like I know what I'm not good at and now I can get an idea and either work on it or try and stay away from it, if that makes sense.



Dr. Luning: It makes sense.



662: So, um, all the, you know, obviously it sucks being down here inSan Diego. It's like, I live 10 minutes from here. It's like you're in it, you see SEALs around here all the time, so it's like that part of it is a little frustrating. Um, you know. At the end of the day, there's no bad things that come from this. I'm still an officer in the navy. I still have great opportunity to apply for things that could potentially get me into some roles outside of the military that I wanted to try and pursue if I made it through training or not, if I was a SEAL or not, so, the door is still wide open, it's just taking a different path. So…



Dr. Luning: Yeah, well great, I’m gonna turn these off.



662: Yeah, sure

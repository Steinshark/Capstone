639:

(laughs)

Dr. Miles:

Okay. Okay. What's your number?

639:

600... 639.

Dr. Miles:

Perfect. Okay. So, um, let's start out, uh, by you telling me, um, kind of a little bit about your childhood, like, you know, your family, parents, siblings, where you grew up, did you move, blah, blah, blah.

639:

Uh, uh, yeah. I'm from New Jersey. Um, I grew up with, uh, my mom, my dad, and my sister. My stepdad, actually. Um, never really knew my biological father.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Um, I have a half sister, but she didn't live with us. Um, [inaudible 00:00:31] dad worked all the time. Mom was home most of the time. She drove me to all my practices and stuff. It was, uh, you know, fairly normal. I mean, bo- both fathers, severe alcoholics. So that was, you know, a good time. But other than that, you know, normal kid, normal childhood.

Dr. Miles:

Normal kid, normal childhood. Okay.

639:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

And then while you were in, um... growing up, did you move much, or did you stay-

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

... in the same place, or-

639:

I moved... we... uh, uh, when I was a little kid, a ton of times, we moved around, but just all around New Jersey. We stayed relatively local. And then when I was a sophomore in high school, we made farther moves, still in New Jersey, up, um... it's called, uh, Sparta, New Jersey, up in Sussex County.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

So we were up in, we were up in, like, the mountains. So...

Dr. Miles:

Okay, so some, but not... it wasn't... you weren't-

639:

No.

Dr. Miles:

... going around the world [crosstalk 00:01:20].

639:

It was never really... yeah, it wasn't, like, uprooting the family and going somewhere crazy.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. All right. And so if you, if you had to describe your personality, like, if you were somebody else and you were describing you, wha- wha- how would you describe yourself? Like, traits or something that make you [crosstalk 00:01:35].

639:

Uh, that's a good question. Uh, oh, um, always curious.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

I'm always trying to learn as much as I can about anything, really.

Dr. Miles:

Oh, that's cool.

639:

Um, very outgoing.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, you definitely seem outgoing.

639:

(laughs)

Dr. Miles:

I mean, yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

Just, just like to have fun.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

That's about it.

Dr. Miles:

Friendly, happy go lucky. [inaudible 00:01:54]

639:

Yeah, just go with the flow.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right. Okay. And so then in the five years that preceded coming to BUD/S, what were you doing? I mean, 'cause I don't know your age and, you know, all that stuff. So, like, kind of what, what led you up to coming here?

639:

Um, I was in high school. I played high school football. Um, and then I went to go play college football. And I just wanted to do something different.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

Um, you know, looking back at it, y- you know, you grow. You get... you mature. You get some experience. Maybe should've just finished college football. But, you know, it's how it goes. But [crosstalk 00:02:27]-

Dr. Miles:

Did you play college football?

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

Where'd you play?

639:

I played at New Mexico Highlands.

Dr. Miles:

New Mexico Highlands. Okay. Like, in the state of New Mexico?

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. And is that division-

639:

Division two.

Dr. Miles:

Division two.

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. And did you get to play there?

639:

Yep. Yeah. So I started playing as a freshman.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Every game. Um, tore my labrum the last game.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

And then, uh, I was 18. You know, I got a little anxious and wanted to go do something new. That's... I don't know, so that's why I'm here.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs) You have a realistic outlook, though, that's for sure.

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

You have to be realistic about all of it, you know.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So then, I guess, you must've said, "Okay, I did my freshman year, now I'm gonna go be a SEAL." Or, like, h- how did you make that decision or [crosstalk 00:03:10]?

639:

Um, I, I, you know, I had heard about this stuff, and I knew someone who did it. I don't know, it just seemed like if I was, I was gonna go join the military, might as well try and do the hardest thing there is, you know, throw my hat in the ring, give it a shot. That's really about it.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right. Yeah, you, you picked the hardest thing, yeah.

639:

(laughs) That's, that's for sure.

Dr. Miles:

[crosstalk 00:03:29] I mean, I'm Army, and I still think it's the hardest thing. So-

639:

(laughs)

Dr. Miles:

Okay, and so then, um, what made you decide to join the Navy? Like, you know, it doesn't sound like you have Navy in your family.

639:

Um, no, no- I mean, my grandfather, but, like, um, brie- briefly. He wa- we weren't, like, a... we're not a military family.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

Um, it was really the Seals. That's the only reason I joined the Navy.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

Um, I mean, but now being in it, um, I mean, now, I'm... like, I'm trying to work towards my degree, and I'd l- I'd love to do what my aunt and uncle did. They flew. So, and I think the Navy's a great place for that as well.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Um, you know, there's a lot of options.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

There's a lot o- there's a lot you can do in here. Um, you know, some of it's not as cool as other stuff. But I guess, you know-

Dr. Miles:

It's a huge amount of opportunities.

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Absolutely, absolutely. So have you been reclassified yet? And do you have a new job?

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

[inaudible 00:04:17]-

639:

Yeah, I'm going down to, um, Pensacola tomorrow-

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

... um, for, uh, air rescue school, so a rescue swimmer. So-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

Another selection. I get to go through that all over again.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, but that'll be cool.

639:

[crosstalk 00:04:27], so-

Dr. Miles:

It'll be different.

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

But-

639:

And I've got a lot of friends who did it, so I think it'll be, it'll be fun. It'll be interesting. [crosstalk 00:04:34]

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, right. And you'll still be making a contribution, and-

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... and all that stuff. So that's, that's super cool.

639:

Yeah, it's still fulfilling.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, yeah, for sure. So how did you become such a good swimmer? I mean, you must be a very good swimmer.

639:

I sucked at swimming-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

... when I first started this. Um, I mean, I w- no, I was, I was a strong swimmer. But I couldn't compete with a lot of the kids here as far as time goes. [inaudible 00:04:55] you just swim. I just swam a lot, you know?

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

And you're forced to do that here. You're forced to do it in Illinois. Like, you just swim. Um-

Dr. Miles:

Swimming's fun.

639:

Yeah, no, actually, I wasn't, I wasn't super comfortable in the water, even though, like, I do a lot of water s- like, I surf all the time. I wake board, water ski. But I wasn't comfortable, for some reason, when I'd go under. So it was, you know, it was just like, just like that. You know, I just had to force myself to do it, and then you just get better at it.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right. Wow, yeah. I mean, that, that seems like a real thing. So then just tell me what happened at BUD/S. Like, w- how did you end up-

639:

Um, so-

Dr. Miles:

... not making it or whatever?

639:

My first class was 347. I got hurt in week two.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Um, [inaudible 00:05:35]-

Dr. Miles:

In week two of phase one?

639:

Yes.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Um, then I went... then I was going with, uh, 349. And actually, on the last day of [inaudible 00:05:44], so right before you class up-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

... and you phase up, um, my father passed away. So I had to go home for that. And then I came back for 351. And, like, I knew when I got back. I was already... I was checked out after my father passed. And I lost my grandfather, a friend, my, my, uh, best friend's sister passed away, freak accident. I was like, uh, I'm li- I don't know, I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff back home, and for what? There's, you know, there's nothing really [inaudible 00:06:08].

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

I, I don't... I just kind of snapped. I was like, I don't-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

... wanna-

Dr. Miles:

It's a lot.

639:

Yeah. No, I just... I was done.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). So then how far into 351 did you go?

639:

I went to Friday.

Dr. Miles:

Friday of-

639:

Of week one.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, week one.

639:

[inaudible 00:06:24]

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

Friday of week one. Yeah, no, I... yeah, that was it, Friday morning, 'cause I told my... I saw a lot of [inaudible 00:06:29] buddies quit that Wednesday. And I told myself, I was like, you know what, I'll just, I'll just do the week, 'cause I knew I was gonna quit. But I was like, [crosstalk 00:06:36].

Dr. Miles:

Really? You know that you were, you were gonna quit?

639:

I, I, I didn't wanna be there. Like, before-

Dr. Miles:

Wow.

639:

... I even started phase, I g- I was like, I don't wanna do this anymore. But, you know, it's the thought of, like, letting people down.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

You know, that scares you a little bit. Um-

Dr. Miles:

Hmm. For sure.

639:

So, like, yeah. No, I, I was like, all right, just be... make it to Friday, so I could say I did the week. I can at least walk out with my head high, and if I ever wanna come back, I will. [crosstalk 00:06:58]

Dr. Miles:

And then you, you initiated the quitting?

639:

Yes.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

But did you pass the... I don't know, whatever the stuff was for week one, the obstacle course-

639:

Oh, yeah, I passed everything.

Dr. Miles:

... and the run and the swim-

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... and all that stuff?

639:

With... oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Wow.

639:

I, I... and that's fine, 'cause in 47, I didn't. And I still ma- and I made it farther in 47. You know, I was f- and I was fine, like, physically.

Dr. Miles:

Wow.

639:

I was just like, no. And, like, I knew I was done. And I was like, I'm not gonna keep torturing myself, you know?

Dr. Miles:

Your heart wasn't in it. You were-

639:

No. Heart w- yeah. Once I got back here, I w- I knew, I knew I was done.

Dr. Miles:

Wow, that's so interesting. I, I've not heard that before. I mean, I've heard all kinds of things.

639:

(laughs)

Dr. Miles:

But I've not heard that. So that was interesting. Okay, so, um, so then, I guess, what ha- what motivated you on a daily basis, like, before you ended up quitting? So I guess probably in these other classes, like, what made you kind of keep going?

639:

Um, i- i- it was honestly, like, it was, it was, you know, like, my boys. Like, it was my friends. Like, i- if they were there, then I was gonna be there too, kind of thing.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

And that's why I made it farther in 47, 'cause I had a lot of my friends still there. Um, I was just-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, that's the thing, man, the, the friend you, y- and then you had to switch groups, and so then you didn't have the friends.

639:

W- and I had a... I have a buddy who's in Japan right now. He ended up quitting week three, right before hell week, in 47. And he l- he s- he quit because we were all gone. Like, we all got hurt or rolled, or some of us had quit by then.

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

639:

He was like, I... he had nobody. So he was like, "I just couldn't do it." [crosstalk 00:08:29]

Dr. Miles:

Right. Yeah.

639:

It's real.

Dr. Miles:

It is real.

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Because you need them to get through.

639:

Oh, yeah, for sure.

Dr. Miles:

And, and so yeah, the whole group, yeah. Okay. So then, um, I guess, did you have to make any difficult decisions in any of these, you know, at least the three different things you were a part of? Did you have to make any difficult decisions that you, you were kind of like, "Oh, I'm not really sure what I should do here"?

639:

Like, in, in phase? Like-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. Um-

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

I often hear stories of people, like, with the boat crew, and, like, one person wasn't good enough or something like that.

639:

So we-

Dr. Miles:

But there's lots more things.

639:

We... every boat crew I was in, um, especially when I was a rollback, 'cause I'd done it before, um, and then we'd have other rollbacks, we, we didn't operate like that. We, we weren't looking to run people out. Like, we... BUD/S w- we... BUD/S care of th- takes care of that. Like, it'll get rid of who it needs to get rid of.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

That's why I'm sitting here.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right.

639:

And we... yeah, no. So there were no, n- that never happened with me. Um, no, BUD/S was fairly simple. It was, go run in the water.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

Be cold. Um, and, and, and get beat. That was, like, that was it to me. Um-

Dr. Miles:

Cold and sandy.

639:

Yeah, no. And it, like, it w- like, you know, stay up, do I stay up all night and clean my helmet and... or, and shine my helmet, you know, clean my room? No, I... and I just went to sleep. And it was like, I'll just get beat tomorrow. I don't care, 'cause it's BUD/S, you know?

Dr. Miles:

Right. What can they do to me?

639:

Exactly.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

That's so funny. Um, okay. Then, um, if you, if you could go back in time and you'd do something differently, would you have done something differently?

639:

Um, like, as a lifestyle change? Or [crosstalk 00:10:03]-

Dr. Miles:

No, no, like, while you were in BUD/S, like, made a different decision-

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

... that might've changed the outcome, or anything like that.

639:

Yeah, I would've tried to stick it out in 47, I think. I think that was my best, best shot, 'cause I, I was still motivated. I still wanted to do this. Um, and I knew my leg was going. But other than that, I was okay.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

So I sh- I think I should've just tried to tough it out a little more, not really show it as much, I guess you could say.

Dr. Miles:

Right.

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

In 47.

639:

Yeah. Um, also, [inaudible 00:10:32]- uh, I don't know. No, I think I made the right decision to go home.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. Had you not gone... I guess you could've not gone home, right-

639:

I... yeah, [crosstalk 00:10:40]-

Dr. Miles:

... [crosstalk 00:10:40] 49. But-

639:

It was literally the last day. But, like, I... like, I w- we were going into phase, and I had a lot of friends in 49. A lot of them are through now.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

So that w- and that class ended up securing 54, I believe. And my other two classes secured 13 or 12.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

So 49 would've been the class, for sure. Um, but, you know, [inaudible 00:11:00] can't curse what... stuff happens.

Dr. Miles:

Y- you don't know. I mean, you know, hindsight's 20/20, right?

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

I mean, you don't know that.

639:

I didn't know that was gonna happen to my father, so-

Dr. Miles:

Right.

639:

... gotta go home.

Dr. Miles:

Is it... was this your father or your stepfather?

639:

So it was my stepfather. My biological father's al-

Dr. Miles:

The guy who raised you, really?

639:

Yes. W- my biological father's also dead, too, [inaudible 00:11:15], yeah.

Dr. Miles:

But you're-

639:

But didn't really know him.

Dr. Miles:

You're less [inaudible 00:11:19]-

639:

Exactly.

Dr. Miles:

... about the other one. That one made a big difference. Okay. And then growing up, did you play any sports?

639:

Uh, yeah. Um, th- football. Um, played football really in high school and college. Um, ran track, played lacrosse in high school as well. Um, I grew up playing baseball and hockey my whole childhood. Any sport.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

If there was a sport, I played it. Like, I was just-

Dr. Miles:

Being active. Yeah, [crosstalk 00:11:42].

639:

Yeah, I love sports.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Okay. And then, um, did you, um, have any practices that you did to try and, try and help get you through things?

639:

Um, definitely breathing.

Dr. Miles:

Really?

639:

Oh, yeah. Like, when we had to do the 50, and like I was saying, I wasn't too comfortable in water, when you have to do the 50-meter underwater. And I, and I... it's funny, 'cause, like, I, I did it in 47, and then I was goo- and you do the 50-meter, and then [inaudible 00:12:09], you have to do the 35 before you can go to phase. And it still stresses everyone out. Like, [inaudible 00:12:15]. But you just sit there and, like, you try not to think about how cold you are or anything. You just, like, you hug the guy in front of you, and you lean back, and you just try and stay warm. And you control your breathing. And you just go, all right, it's gonna be fine, I'll be all right. If I pass out, I'm not gonna die.

Dr. Miles:

Right.

639:

They'll get me. So yeah, breathing for sure. Um, yeah, no, I mean, uh, stop being soft. That's [inaudible 00:12:41], like-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.

639:

You're sitting there in the water. Just be like, just, you know, just stop. You know, you can do it.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, just stop thinking about it and just-

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, it's surprising on breathing, how much that can help-

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... things, just-

639:

Oh, you know what? The be- here's, here's a good one for you. The, um, the two-mile ocean swims.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

639:

Um, I had a system. It's gonna sound crazy, but I had a system. I would count every 200 strokes, but I needed to mess up. And if I messed up a number, I'd make myself go back 10 numbers, 'cause it would take longer that way.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

So, like, it sounds nuts.

Dr. Miles:

No, no, it sounds great.

639:

And then I would... and then I'd sing a song in my head after the 200 strokes. And then I'd repeat the process. And I knew once I did that rou- like, roughly four to five sets of that, the swim was over, like, if I timed it out properly. So that helps. (laughs)

Dr. Miles:

That is a great thing.

639:

Yeah, that helps.

Dr. Miles:

I mean, that's a really cool... right, 'cause it gets your mind out of what you're doing.

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Otherwise it's so boring.

639:

Yeah, just, yeah, you gotta go mindless.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

You know, just count and sing.

Dr. Miles:

So you would count 200, and then if you messed up, you would go back-

639:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

... to 10 numbers before you-

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

And then you-

639:

It sounds nuts coming out of my mouth.

Dr. Miles:

No.

639:

But it did help. (laughs)

Dr. Miles:

No, it, it... anything to captivate your mind, concentrating on something other than what is sucking-

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... is really important.

639:

Oh, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

And, and that, that sounds great to me.

639:

Got me through the swims.

Dr. Miles:

I don't think I could've thought of all the words to a song, but, you know.

639:

So, and that's the thing, y- 'cause I wouldn't... 'cause you're swimming. So it's rea- you're trying to focus also on, you know, getting a good time, 'cause you need to-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

639:

... come in at a certain time. And I would forget words to songs I know and, like, I've sang a million times. And then I would have to just sit there. And, like, and then I'd go silent, and I'd have to think about it again, which also killed time, which was nice.

Dr. Miles:

W- and you couldn't really sing. You're singing it in your head-

639:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... 'cause your mouth's in the water, so you can't... yeah.

639:

Yep.

Dr. Miles:

That's a really... that's really cool. I like that. (laughs) Okay. And then, um, do you think this experience at BUD/S changed you as a person at all?

639:

Um, I guess maybe. Um, not as much as, like, one might think. Um, it, it was definitely an experience. But, I mean, growing up, like, playing sports and, and the way I grew up, like, it w- it was kind of no different. Like, it was get yelled at, and get told to do something, and go do it. And if you don't, then, then you pay... then there's consequences. You know, it was... I didn't... I de- I, I think I grew more from the fact that... like I was saying, maybe I should've waited a little longer. Maybe I should've matured more or grown up a little more.

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

639:

Fi- I mean, finished out playing ball and c- and got my degree. Um, 'cause now I'm playing catch-up with all that, and now it's... you know, you're a kid. And, uh, like, everyone's like, "Yeah, you should definitely finish your degree. And y- you're getting it for free, just do it. Don't worry about that Navy stuff. It's not going anywhere." And I was like, no, I know what, I know what's best for me. So, you know, hindsight's always 20/20.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. I'll... I'm gonna come back to that after.

639:

Hmm.

Dr. Miles:

But I, I, I don't, I don't, I don't think so.

639:

Yeah?

Dr. Miles:

I, I think you probably did the right thing. But, but you know, I mean, that's just my opinion. But okay. And then my last question is, um, what, what would you ask if you were sitting over here? Like, what, what is it that, that we should know about you guys that we're not asking, that we're missing the point? Like, we're trying to figure out how to make it... the session process better so that the people are more successful. Like, what could we be asking to get at that better?

639:

Um, uh, you can, you can, I guess, ask us how often we try to cheat the system.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

We do that quite often.

Dr. Miles:

How do you, how do you even cheat the system?

639:

Y- there... uh, anything. There's, uh... so, for example, in 51, my last class, we got [inaudible 00:16:21] in the morning. And we got out of the water, and it was cold, like, really, really cold. And our c- our uniforms were dry. And we were like, that's huge. We're gonna go to breakfast with dry uniforms. That never happens. So we... everyone's, like, throwing their stuff on. They're like, we need to get out of here before they come over the berm. And we start running.

Dr. Miles:

But wait a minute, you were in the surf. How could your uniforms be dry?

639:

We went in in our underwear, in our... yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Oh. (laughs)

639:

So yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. G- go ahead.

639:

So me and a group of, like, 30 other kids were like, no, we're getting out of here. So we just start running. And as we're running down the beach, we hear in the background, "Hit the surf," which we knew was coming. And we were, like, pretend you didn't hear it, just keep running. And we just kept running. Um, we did get caught.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs)

639:

And w- (laughs) and we did pay, pay real bad that day for that, 'cause we also had [inaudible 00:17:08]. Um, another way, swimmer inspection. Um, you, you have to get inspected before you go do these swims.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

If you fail the inspection, you drop down, do your pushups, and you just basically sit there [inaudible 00:17:19] and go get wet and sandy constantly. And it, it sucks. Um, so I got... I failed an inspection. But the instructor never told me to drop. So I-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

So I just told my buddy to just take a knee, and we're not gonna say anything. And that one, that one I got away with. (laughs)

Dr. Miles:

Oh. Well, there you go. What are they inspecting you for-

639:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

... for your swim?

639:

You have your UDT vest, your dive knife, your CO2, um, make sure your stencils are all properly... they wanna make sure your vest is on right, wanna make sure your actuator works properly, um, no rust on anything. It w- it's, it's, it's pretty... I mean, it, it's, it's passable. It's very passable if you spend the time on it. But, like I was saying, I, I went to sleep. I didn't-

Dr. Miles:

You didn't really worry about that.

639:

No, 'cause I could just-

Dr. Miles:

But aren't you just swimming, like, and breathing? Like, you're not... it's not underwater swimming, right? I mean, you're-

639:

No.

Dr. Miles:

... doing this, right?

639:

So you're doing, yeah, side, uh, combat sidestroke. Um-

Dr. Miles:

So why do you need CO2 and-

639:

So if y- if something happens, if you... let's say you pass out or-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

... let's say crazy situation that's never happened here, a, a shark gets you, and i- y- you gotta pull that CO2. And it's a, it's a vest. It... uh, it's, like, a life vest.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

It inflates.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

639:

Um, you have your dive knife on you just in case you get caught up in anything.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

639:

Um, or a shark, I guess. I don't know. Um-

Dr. Miles:

Just, just 'cause they can probably.

639:

Yeah. And then you got your l- oh, you got your, your smoke grenade. That's if, like, something really bad goes down. You gotta toss that. But no, I've never seen that happen.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right, right. But, you know, something to give you an inspection for.

639:

Yeah. Yep.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. So I'm gonna stop this.

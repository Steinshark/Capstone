Dr. Dixon:

All right, we'll go ahead and start if you don't mind. So what was your number?

601:

601.

Dr. Dixon:

And are you okay if I record this?

601:

That's fine.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay, great, super. As you know what commander Ledford said why we're here and I'm gonna just start off with some basic questions. So could you tell me a little bit about your childhood? Like, did you move around a lot? What brothers do you have, are your parents still married? Just basic stuff.

601:

Uh, yeah. Parents are married, still, uh, moved around like every three years. Uh, older brother and younger sister.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And, uh, what, where, where were you from? Like what state?

601:

Uh, I was born in Hawaii. Um, I moved like when I was two. I moved again, like, I guess I'm from California. I lived there the most.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. If you had to describe your personality in three traits, what would you describe it when other people look at you? What would they say?

601:

Um, calm, uh, disciplined. Hmm, maybe quiet.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. No, that, that works. Okay. And what have you done in the past five years prior to BUDS? Like, did you go to high school? Did you go to college, you know, kind of, what was your life like the past five years?

601:

Um, well, five years, I guess the first year would be senior, senior year of high school. Uh, and then four years of college.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And where'd you go to college?

601:

Uh, San Diego State University.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. So you are from right around here.

601:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Wow. And if you, would you say that prior to BUDS, did you have any life changing experiences that made a big impact on you?

601:

Uh, no.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Um, and then, uh, so nothing really, you had a pretty average childhood you'd say and life?

601:

Uh, well, I was a military brat, so, and I moved around a lot, so I'd, it's a little, a little different from most kids growing up, but other than that.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Okay. And then, so what was your background that led you to join the Navy?

601:

Oh, my dad's Navy. Uh, I just always, I wanted to do it since I was little.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And, uh, I was training for it most of my whole life and yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. So-

601:

I was always very passionate about it.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And what would you say motivates you on a daily basis?

601:

Uh, wanting to do something that, wanting to do something that I want to do that's, you know, I know it sounds kind of corny but just-

Dr. Dixon:

No, no, no.

601:

Be like a warrior, like to be-

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah.

601:

I don't know. Be very capable or capable than most people.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And you had that prior to BUDS and then you still have that now, right?

601:

Yeah absolutely.

Dr. Dixon:

So, um, describe your experience at BUDS. What would you say, you know, just tell me your story.

601:

Well, uh, the first week it went really well. Um, I knew it was gonna be hard going in, uh, and it met all expectations. Um, and I remember, you know, the first boat crew, I was the shortest guy of the giants. Uh, I was the shortest of the tall guys. Um, and so I'm about six, three. I was with guys that are like 6'5, 6'4. Um, and, uh, I remember being very eager, eager to prove myself. Um, but actually kind of that came kind of became my downfall later on while getting into that. But I, I remember always being in the end of the log, I was always in the two spot of the boat. Um, cause I just wanted to prove myself to my, my teammates, you know, I wanted to prove my worth and uh, you know, it went good the first week went great.

601:

It was really hard, but you know, I knew I was gonna get through it. I, I think it was gonna make me break. I felt in invincible. And, uh, and when I got done with that first week, you know, I saw my dad and, uh, yeah, that was really great. And I got breakfast with some of the guys that made it through with me that I went to bootcamp with, um, morale was very high. Uh, he is, I mean, we had the highest number of DORs of the first week. Than any BUDS class in history and-

Dr. Dixon:

Wow.

601:

You know, I realized was it, it would become very hard, uh, the pipeline, uh, and right there, you know, I was like, I was, I'm definitely gonna make it, you know, there's nothing that's gonna make me quit (laugh), you know, I was, I felt very strong about it, but the thing was, you know, both my knees were swollen up to the size of chickens by the end of the week. And, uh, I didn't think much of then, you know, I was, I just, what kind of got me by surprise is the second week and third week was just the degradation your body goes through. Um, and it doesn't matter, you know, how mentally on top of that, you could be, you know, it's, once you're unable to perform at that point, you know, you're in a very tough spot and that's a spot I really like didn't like being in, um, so the thing was the second week begins there.

601:

I, I catch VGE the first day of the second week. So that starts happening there, the first day, that Monday I was fine. Uh, then we had land portage that, that Tuesday, and, uh, I had been fine, you know, more than fine. The first few land portages, I mean it was horrible, but, you know, I did my job, I did it satisfactory. Uh, and I was running the two most of the time, uh, when we get to this land Portage and something, wasn't right. You know, I was, uh, I don't wanna get into details. It's pretty gross. But-

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah.

601:

You know, most of the calories I had eaten were-

Dr. Dixon:

Coming out.

601:

Coming out, you know.

Dr. Dixon:

I got it.

601:

Yeah. And, uh, you know, I get into that, that land portage trying to say, we get about my own and I start just having trouble and I'm falling out. I'm so weak that I can't even, you know, it gets to the point where I'm trying to run. I can't even get my back up. It's the weirdest thing, you know, it's something I never felt in my life, but you know, it's very frustrating. You train that long. And for some reason, you know, your body's not able to perform.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

Uh, anyways, it was, that was probably one of the hardest hour and a halfs, two hours of my life was those I was putting in everything, you know, everything I had, but the result was just absolutely mediocre, me- mediocre, sorry. And, uh, you know, I could hardly help my teammates out and, uh, yeah. Afterwards or so most of the guys, you know, they knew who I was, they knew how I performing past, and they're just like, "You had a bad day. I get it." You know? Um, so I kept, you know, I, I, I didn't even think quitting when I was in that state, you know, uh, I get through the second week, I also have trouble, you know, my knees are really starting to, to have, get even worse at this point. And, uh, I remember those logs.

601:

I can't remember which day it was the second week, but we're doing the lunges and we get to about the eightieth set and around there is when I start falling off and my legs, aren't, aren't able to keep up. And so that's just another time where I'm, you know, I'm very, I'm starting to, to fall off. And, uh, around this point, some of the guys in my boat crew, I had so much respect for they're, you know, they're might have been taking certain things or they're not, definitely not the best guys.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

They're starting to get on my ass and you know, they're like, "You gotta fucking quit," You know, sorry to curse, but I'm just.

Dr. Dixon:

No, no, believe me, I've heard everything. I was in the army for 22 years, so.

601:

Okay.

Dr. Dixon:

I got it.

601:

And, uh, you know, I knew it wasn't no matter how mean they were, whatever they, if they had a point, you know, it's, you have to be, uh, under that boat, you have to be, um, you're doing your job, but I just couldn't, I couldn't find that to be a good enough reason. You know, I just, uh, nothing, I didn't want to quit, you know, nothing was gonna need to quit. I didn't care if body was falling apart. I didn't care if you know this, if I wasn't doing a satisfactory job, like the instructors and even some of the guys in my boat group kept reminding me and, uh, got through that second week at this point, I know my body is just not looking good. And my dad actually was, my dad was a, I'm legacy. My dad was in the teams and, um.

Dr. Dixon:

He was.

601:

Yeah. And he is, he is shocked at like what it had become, you know, uh, compared to his experience 30 years ago. Um, but that was a hard weekend cause I was, I was with him and my mom and, um.

Dr. Dixon:

And that was the second weekend.

601:

Yes, that was after the second week. And uh, he basically looked at me and was like, dude, there's no way you're gonna, like, you have looked into getting rolled or something or, you know, fine. These, everything was swollen at this point. You know, my, my neck was swollen, my wrists. So I had lacerations everywhere. I had multiple infections. Uh, I was just getting around, you know, and he was, it was very upsetting to him. I don't know, you know, I, I was, I figured he'd be fine with it cause he, he's gone through before, but it's just such a different pipeline, figured out what he went through. And um, and I just like, you need to look into getting the rolled or something. I'm like, at that point it's like, I, I had to be in, in denial cause if I was like, if I had any doubt where I was like, "No, there's no way I get through this." Then you're definitely not getting through it.

Dr. Dixon:

Right.

601:

You know? So I was just like, now you're just full of shit. Like I could do it. Like I just pushed through. Um, because you have to be in denial. If that's, you know, where your mental, if your mind is, you know, you can't take it through. And so you know I actually go, I actually didn't, uh, you're supposed to stay like 30 few, so hours, so many miles around the base, you know how Liberty works and uh, you have to be there at nights. But at that point I'm mustered in the afternoon I was like, my dad was like, are we taking, taking you home for a bit? Which is more than that, you know, Liberty restriction is, uh, and I was like, I'm doing it, everyone's getting away, everyone, all the officers are going home. I'm going home. Like-

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

You know, I'm leaving base. And so I go home and they take care of me. It, it was, was good for that night and you know, but it's Sunday, Sunday morning, the next day I'm heading back there. Uh, and into another week of, of, uh, you know, just the same stuff. And, uh, we do the first three days, the first three days that week, one of those days was one of the hardest BUDS days. Uh, we actually had, and I actually felt like, you know, I absolutely sold my soul that third week to get through. Um, I feel like I did bounce back a little bit on land portage was a lot better than the one on week two, but I was still, you know, running, getting run out a few times in the sprints. Um, I, I was still was clear that I was one of the weaker ones in my boat crew. And, uh, even for logs though, I didn't, I directly fail on logs as I did the second week.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And I was coming back. But the thing was, I was given everything I had for that, that logs. I was given everything I had for that land portage. I was given everything that I had for that night evo on Tuesday, which was nighttime rock portage. And, uh, you know, I was basically just emptying the tank on that and what we had the fourth week was hell week. And I couldn't just go in there with the an empty tank. And so, you know, we, the last two days of that third week is mostly like gear issue. It's mostly prep for hell week. They're giving you your gear. You're getting, uh, a few like ethics, moral classes. I don't know. It was all kind of worship bullshit, but, uh, we did, uh, a few little workouts and one of the workouts was Friday. It was like a, a fun little pit, like a PTE. And it was like a, you have like four groups and then you do like a little like, so it's pushups here, then box jumps here, then pullups here.

601:

And I was just, I was the anchor of my group. You know, I was, I was so messed up at this point. I couldn't, you know, my lungs are starting to go at this point too. I had, uh, pneumonia, bronchitis, just all like blood and all like yellow stuff coming out of my lungs. You know, I felt like I was breathing on half lung. And so I was, I was basically, I was able to keep up almost, but I was still the last person getting done. And, um, so we did that. Our, our group came in last, uh, and then we had a, well, it was like a, a four mile or conditioning run, which is like eight, 730, eight minute pace, which is super easy.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah.

601:

You know, it's, I, you know, I ran much faster than that. Plenty of times, you know, I was one of the well faster run, one, like up in the highest, like 10% of runners in the class when we started out, I had no problem with that, but not, not the state I was in. You know, I started to run and, uh, immediately I started falling out, you know, I'm, I'm having trouble catching my breath and it wasn't, it wasn't, if it wasn't for the guys, the way the instructor said it is like, right, this is be a nice, easy run. Uh, but if people start falling out, we're gonna turn back right away and just start, it's gonna be a lot longer and a lot faster. Uh, and so it was in everyone's interest to not have anyone fall back.

601:

So, you know, I had guys, guys pushing me, you know, luckily through the run. Uh, and that was one of the hardest, you know, the hardest four mile run at eight minute pace I ever had to run in my life is, you know, I was so winded. I couldn't even get a full breath. Um, and I forced, my legs just destroyed this time. So I had two, two of those factors against me and I was just getting pushed the whole time. And, you know, I, I just felt like shit, cause you know, I wanna be the guy pushing guys, you know, helping the guys out, helping the team out except I'm opposite scenario. You know, I hated being in that, that scenario. I hated being that guy.

601:

Uh, but you know, I was to this point, I know, uh, it wasn't enough to make me quit. You know, I knew I was hurting other people. Uh, and so we, we finished that run and, uh, at this point too, uh, so I shouldn't have left this out, but the day, the night prior to this, uh, I had, I missed the afternoon muster. So I was, I was cleaning myself again because I kind of had another accident throughout the day.

Dr. Dixon:

From the VGE.

601:

Yeah. And, uh, I was in the upstairs shower. No one was, so I don't spread it to anyone. I was, you know, disinfecting my whole body disinfecting, all the cuts I had. Uh, and while I was, this was right after I got down with all my collaterals and uh, I realized, you know, I didn't get that muster and our LPO, who's a guy very much respected. Um, you know, I looked up to, he actually had gone through the pipeline before, got dropped after hell and he's back here again. And so he's, you know, been through the block and, uh, he was like, I'm not gonna tell you to quit or anything. You know, I'm not gonna, like, he was, you know, something that happened here, you know, if he was at this point, I was like in survival mode, you know, it like, it didn't matter. I just have to, I have to find some way to get better and some way to perform.

601:

And, uh, you know, when you do that, you're kind of your mindfulness kind of takes a, a step back. Uh, it's not as like the number one priority prior to him for one is getting through it and that's all it matters. Uh, and so he is like, what the heck man, you can't be missing a muster. Like you can't be doing stuff like that. And uh, he's like, you gotta get your head outta your ass. And like, you have to find some way to perform and get through this. Like, I really do like you and that right there was like, it was what I needed here, but it hurt more than it hurt hearing that more than any of the guys, any instructors like telling me to quit, like going up to me and be like, I'm a fuck you up. If you don't quit. Like those are guys in my boat too.

601:

Those aren't just the instructors. And, uh, that hurt more than any of that, you know, but it was something I had to hear. You know, I, I completely understood you. I came from our LTO and our OIC who I both respected, who are both really the only real leaders in our class. Because a lot of our officers, you know, I don't mean to shit talk a lot of them weren't doing, their doing their jobs and doing what they're meant to do. And, uh, so anyways, you know, hearing that was a huge thing. And then of course, the next day that run happens and I'm like, all right, well, you, I don't know if I'm gonna be able get to this, but I'm fucking try. So that weekend I went straight home, you know, we covered some more back home, this, you know it helped a lot.

Dr. Dixon:

Sure.

601:

To get me through the third week. So I went home, uh, yeah, I disinfected as much as I could eat, ate as much as I could and slept as much as I could, uh, came back there. Um, yeah, we sitting in the classroom, I'm scared shitless, you know, waiting that classroom. And I, uh, you know, I'm not at all religious at all, but I prayed for the first time in that room (laugh) uh, and, um, yeah, we started up, we, we started breakout and, you know, I wasn't, I wasn't scared or anything really when we were doing breakout, uh, you know, it was just calisthenics. I had no problem with calisthenics getting in the cold, getting wet. I had no problem with that. Um, you know, when we, then we start off the first logs, you know, after like a, after like a surf torture sesh or, you know, surf immersion sesh or that, and we started up and of course it's like the one thing I, I, I can't do this.

601:

Like, it's the one thing I, I'm not good at. I feel like, and I, like my condition doesn't make it easy to be, surv- like to survive it. And that's the, the logs with the lunges, you know what I mean, and we start that up and it's a long, long session and, uh, I'm just utterly failing at these lunges, you know, I'm like, I get to like the 30th set and I'm, you know, I'm collapsing and falling over, um, you know, we, I'm getting, I'm like dizzy and I'm, I'm having a hard time breathing. And, uh, but I'm just like, all right, well, I'm thinking to myself why we're doing this. It's like, this is the first thing, hell, this is the one of the first things at hell week, you know, this is the first of three log sets. All the, all the instructors are on me. All of them are just focused on me, you know.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

Uh, half of my [Inaudible], again, telling me to quit, you know, I'm like, I just can't even comprehend quitting. You know, I couldn't up until, until here, but I'm looking at the two guys I like in my log or the three guys that I like who I'm in the logs, in the logs with. I see how much of a hell I'm making their life for having to pick up my slack. And, uh, I see that I'm like, all right, well, if I do this, I'm not doing this, like in the middle of a, in the middle of a, um, Evo, you know, I was in a lot of pain to be like a factor in my overall decision. And so I'm like, "All right, well, let's just get through this and we'll reconvene and see what you know, options are." Uh, and so that whole access just horrible. I mean, I was dropping a log on my head. I was getting all dizzy and falling over and I, I was just getting torn into by everyone (laugh).

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

It was, you know, and I was just fucking destroyed (laughs). My body was destroyed. And, uh, we were the last log crew to secure. So everyone was off standing there. We were still getting beat and they were like, "All right, now go get your boat." And this is just us. So we get our boat. Now we're doing sprint to the boat. And, uh, and like everyone, this is like 15 to 20 minutes after the last group has been, you know, set. So there's, I can tell it's like, okay, I see what they're trying to do. They're trying to get me outta here as fast as they can. And, uh, then we get, they finally like, "All right, you'll have a snack and hydrate over with the rest of the guys." And so it's all the, the boat crews are lined up and we can finally get in there and we're eating. Uh, and then both those guys, one of them being officer comes right up to me.

601:

Like, "You have to get the fuck outta here." Like wouldn't mean that mean, but they were like, they're actually like, cause when they were like dicks about it, that's when I was like, "Fuck you. I'm not leaving." Like now they're actually like, they're, you know, I could see the writing on the wall. And uh, you know, I was see the whole point of this, I guess after the week two it was like, "All right, I'm gonna go until I get a role." You know, I don't know how easy that's gonna be, but they weren't rolling anyone in this class. You know, no one was getting roles. I think two enlisted guys in our class got rolled from hell week. Uh, but, uh, yeah, I was, that was my hope really, I think after week two was trying to get a role, um.

Dr. Dixon:

To get healthy.

601:

Yeah. But I think they, they hated me at so much to this point. I didn't think I was gonna, there was no way I was gonna get a role and uh, I mean, no one was getting rules. And, uh, at that point I was like, I decided I was like, I'm gonna talk to like, I, I just needed. I felt like I had to talk to someone, you know, so I thought I was like, "Hey, where's like, where's the LPO." Like, cause I, I've trusted him since the beginning. I, I know he is a good guy and I'm like, "Hey man, what do you think? You think? Like what you think my options are. I mean like what can I, what can I do?" And he's like, "Dude, I mean, like you're still young. You come back in a few years maybe." Uh, and so here that I was like, there's, there is that. Uh, and so I was like, well, I don't see them kind of like in a box right here. There's not much I could do. And so I, uh, I was like, yeah, it's time and went over to the instructors, thanked them, thanks. So thank you for the opportunity, went over to the bell and you know, they taught me the procedure and I rang out right there on the o-course.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And so that was, that was it.

Dr. Dixon:

Wow. Okay. Well thank you for sharing. I appreciate that. Um, so if I had to ask you, tell me a time when you had to make a difficult decision at BUDS and what went through your mind and could you gimme an example?

601:

Mm-hmm, I guess ringing out would be the most difficult decision I had to do.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

601:

And, uh, what was going through my head was, you know, like from the beginning, I was like, don't ever fucking betray yourself. You know, you have this goal, I'm this one time, the third day where were doing, uh, the first three days were really hard. And this was that, that Wednesday. And it was, we were doing a swimmer, like a, a boat PT kind of thing at the, uh, end of the day. And we also had screwed up earlier in the day and we had to have to make up for that. We had to, we were gonna do a surf torture at the end of this day, after the nighttime boat PT. And I was cold. I remember being cold as hell sitting. Like I had the boat on my head. I was sitting in the shore and the water was like up to here and I was freezing my ass off. And, uh, this is after like so many people have, have left, left this day. And this was the one time I started shaking a little bit. I was, I started to get scared and I was just like, we're fine.

601:

You know, I calmed all down and I was fine. That was the one moment, you know, I was like, I ain't comprehend quitting, but I, I, I got like, I almost let myself get afraid, you know, but I was able to stop it. And, um, I was like, thinking at this time on that on those logs in hell week. Uh, don't betray yourself. Like this is betraying yourself. Like I can't quit. I can't, I can't betray myself. But, you know, seeing what had become with me and what my options were at that point, you know, and at that point, like the rationality soft side of me was like, this isn't betraying yourself. This is just what has to be done. And, uh-

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

Like, this is your only option. There's like, I could go back in and suck some more and make the [inaudible], my boat crew, you know, hell more. And instructors would probably hate me even more. They get less likely for me to get rolled, uh, and just find some way to beat me or my boat crew some more until, you know, the, you know, the eventuality of it would happen, you know, or they may pull me.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. So is there anything that you would knowing what, you know now, is there anything you would've done differently during BUDS?

601:

Um, is this gonna go on the record. So, I mean, obviously, yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

But it's not connected to your name.

601:

Okay then. Uh, I would've looked into taking steroids. Some kind of, uh, SARS or HDH is a large percentage of the classes was on it. And I think if I would've been on that but my body would've held together more and, uh.

Dr. Dixon:

Hmm.

601:

It wouldn't, I, I'd have a better chance at scheming it.

Dr. Dixon:

How did you know that other people were doing that and, you know, that helped them? Did they tell you that or?

601:

Yeah, a lot of people told me.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And, uh, you could, you could obvious tell on certain people it's it's obvious. Um, yeah, I would have, a lot of guys, what happens is they get rolled back, they'll get rolled and, uh, just basically from their body breaking down. And, uh, they'll, I'm sorry.

Dr. Dixon:

That's okay.

601:

They'll decide that, you know, if this is what's keeping me, is my body, you know, it's because they'll, they'll have it, you know, they'll have the mental ability and the toughness and the grit to get through it. It's just is a factor of, is your body gonna stay, get to the point where you'd still perform. And, um, at that point, a lot of guys would just like, let's just take this. And, uh, uh, you know.

Dr. Dixon:

Do you think that actually helps or did that just hide, hide the symptoms?

601:

Um, well I think it does both. Some guys take stuff to, so they don't SIPE out. So I don't know if it's like the blood in the lungs.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And, uh, it's mostly just recovery time for a lot of the stuff it's, uh, it helps your body recovery more. It's not so much performance most guys already can perform to get there. It's just the battle of keeping your body from just being dilapidated after so little sleep or so much of calorie deficit and, uh.

Dr. Dixon:

Right.

601:

Just everything they do there. So I'd look at defining ways to keep my body from breaking down. If that was one of the ways I'd have to do it, I'd I, I would've done it.

Dr. Dixon:

So a lot of people that we have interviewed already that have graduated, this was two years ago before COVID we came and we talked to a bunch of different people who had just finished BUDS. And a lot, several of them had come to BUDS like two or years prior, and then for some reason didn't make it. And then they came back two or three years later. Do you think that, would you ever consider coming back?

601:

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

601:

Yeah. I mean, that was my, that's my number point plan so far. Um, hopefully I can do it in two or three years. I don't know if I would wanna do it in five. Uh, obviously knows what life conditions could change by then. Uh, so yeah, that's, I mean, that's a plan right now.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Uh, and then, um, what practices did you use to push through any challenges you have, like mental, physical, spiritual. Did you use anything while you were at BUDS?

601:

Well, I'm not the most spiritual person. Um, but certain things I did. I just try to keep, get my mind off of. Well, one thing is like, I never wanted to know what was gonna happen next. I always wanted to be surprised. I never like, like the, I'm one guy, you know, he is a good guy too. I mean, he got the first week with me. I got breakfast on that, that Saturday. Um, but he quit that next Monday, but he was always being like, okay, so we have this on, he's looking forward to like the second and third week. He's like, we have this on this day, this and that day. And I'm like, dude, you're gonna like, there's, I was not surprised when I heard he quit, because there's, you're gonna psych yourself out. If you try to look for that forward, you know, in time.

601:

And, um, yeah, just not, I didn't want to know what was gonna happen. I didn't wanna know how much time we had left. But one thing I did do was when we were out, uh, you know, in like in afternoon block, you know, between, [inaudible] I'd always look at the sun and be like, oh, the sun is so low in the sky, gotta be done soon, you know? (laughs) Um, and, uh, I guess when it got really bad, like our, I remember the first land portage of the, the first week we had two guys fall of the boat instantly. And we had five guys and I was the sole person in the middle of spot. And it was like that on the way down, it was absolute hell. And that was when I really broke a barrier between how, how much I thought I was capable of.

601:

I just remember thinking this is the worst thing ever you now. And that I remember, uh, uh, master chief Mags, um, he, one of the talks he gave us he was, like, yeah, one, one of the techniques he taught was count backwards from seven. I remember thinking at the time I was like, "That's stupid. I'm not gonna have to do that." (laugh) I was like, "Seven, six, five." (laughs). You know, four during this, you know, it, it was absolute hell. And, um, so that was one, but yeah, I, I just try to keep positive and it's really just the fear that's the worst, you know, anticipation.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And it's best to get your mind off of that. Uh, yeah. Find something to look forward, look forwards to the weekend.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah. So how do you think this experience changed you as a person?

601:

Um, um, it took away a lot of my doubts. It, uh, I remember like, cause you hear people about people quitting like the first few days and I was like, I would have this like irrational fear going into it. Cause I had a good friend of mine, um, who I trained with a lot and he quit a third day all of a sudden. And it was very surprising to me cause he was a very in shape guy and uh, he seemed very passionate about it. Um, so like that started this irrational fear. Like, "What if I'm that guy? What if I just can't hack it?" You know? But you know, going through it, it was like, there was plenty of times where there was so much going against me, but it didn't matter. I was pushed through. And um, I remember thinking like, you know, now I know, like I know what I'm native now.

601:

I know how my mind, my, my mind works now. It's I know like this is the type of work for me, uh, without a doubt. So it's definitely taken away a lot doubt. Uh, but you know, it's hard, it's hard failing. It sucks. Um, yeah, but also like failing is, it's taught me a lot, this experience now, even if I make it through, I, uh, I feel like I've learned more in those three weeks than I ever did four years in college, you know? Uh, so.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah, I sure. So what phase did you leave?

601:

It'd be first phase.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And then, um, how many weeks ago was it?

601:

Um, eight, eight weeks I think.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

601:

Eight and a half weeks.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Okay. So we're looking to write this, these articles about, um, you know, people being resilient and, and like we talked about before, is there anything I should have asked you about, like if somebody reads this before they go to BUDS, what advice would, what should I have asked you that you don't think that we probably got from all the questions that I asked you?

601:

Um, uh, you're pretty thorough. Uh, sorry I need a minute here to think about this one.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah, sure.

601:

Uh, I guess just try to know who you are a little bit before you go in, um, try to put yourself in a situation that's just got awful. Um, just know how you react to it. Uh, that's hard to do, you know, before going in, I, I had a good mentor up in LA that I would go to, and he, you know, he'd beat us down pretty good on the beach. Uh, he definitely, he got us, there's some moments where it was pretty, pretty bad, nothing like after [inaudible] pipeline, but, um, that was a help for sure. Um, and just know you want to do the job, there is no other job is gonna suck too. You know, it's not like you get through the pipeline that all, all's good. It's, you know, it's, it's a lifestyle of dealing with circumstances. And uh, if you're not about that, then you know, it's probably not for you.

601:

Um, but yeah, just try to avoid being in that situation where you, you feel like you only have one option where you do only have one option. Um, cause it sucks. You know, you always want to be like, I guess looking back on it, when that first week I was so obsessed with being that guy who gets, you know, who carries that extra weight and gets you through that? When I was always in that end log spot, I was always in that two spot. I didn't realize, but I was degrading my body fast. And some of these other guys, and maybe I should have been a little more selfish, you know, like not selfish, but like, you know, I only take in my fair share of weight and only.

Dr. Dixon:

Not always being the number one guy that took it.

601:

Yeah. Don't worry about being the number one guy, just get through those first few days or that first week, and just have more of that mindset of it's about preservation to some extent of your body. You know, you gotta get to my, my buddy actually made it through, uh, went, he was a year before me, um, told me, get to hell week healthy, you know, just get to hell week healthy. And you're good, unless some freak accident happens, you know, anything can happen. Uh, but he actually, he got rolled his, his first time, second week of phase, uh, for pneumonia. And then he, and he got rolled and got a second chance and uh, and he made it through. And so that's what he said, you know, he was just get to hell week healthy. And, uh, I was not healthy when I got to hell week (laugh) and uh, now I know, I know what he is talking about, but at that point my options were very limited, so.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative) cause they weren't rolling people.

601:

Yeah. No one was getting to roll.

Dr. Dixon:

And was your family okay with it?

601:

Uh, my dad was kind of pissed. I mean, I'll be honest. He was, uh, you know, he was big in the community. He was, he only got out two or three years ago, so he is, you know, fairly known and um, he, you know, he just, he couldn't understand how much BUDS had changed since his day. And when he, when he saw me come, come like, come back on the first week or he saw me the first week, you know, I was up at this breakfast place and uh, but he saw my body. He was like, "Dude, I only looked that bad after my hell week." And this was after my first week. And, uh, I was so excited though. I, he, he was so concerned, but I, I didn't even pick up on it cause I was just so excited so to make it through the first week.

601:

Uh, cause I nothing, you know, I haven't, I haven't felt full effects of my body breaking down on me yet. You know, it was a whole new level. Like I had never, uh, you know, you never work out so hard that, you know, you're, you know, you're infected and-

Dr. Dixon:

Right.

601:

Coughing up gunk and your knees are swollen, like double their size, you know, cause you're never gonna do that, no human urge to do that for themselves just on their own, without some alternate goal, you know of, you know making this pipeline.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

And uh, so I'd never experienced such a how bad your body you could get. I, so I, I didn't see, I didn't see it from where I was at that point. So I didn't see his, the main threat. Uh.

Dr. Dixon:

But maybe he saw it a little bit.

601:

Yeah. Maybe he, he's, you know, he's older, he's had two hip, two new hips at this point. He's known like, you know, how bad it could get. And so seeing like now looking back on how hard it is, it makes complete sense. And I got it after the second week (laugh).

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative).

601:

Yeah, so.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. All right. Well that's all I have. Unless you have anything else you want to talk about?

601:

Uh, no.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

601:

About it.

Dr. Dixon:

Thank you.

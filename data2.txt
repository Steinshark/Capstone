OKAY, AND WHAT’S YOUR PARTICIPANT IDS?
WHEN DID YOU START BUDS AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST CLASS?

THIS IS MY FOURTH CLASS. I STARTED DECEMBER OF 2018 WITH UH 335.

OKAY A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND. HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE AND
WHAT’S THEIR BIRTH ORDER LIKE YOUNGER SISTER, OLDER BROTHER?

I HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER WHO IS 30 AND A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO IS 8.

WERE YOU PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

UH, THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED.

AND THEN WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THEM?

UH, WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP. WITH BOTH OF THEM AND THEY ARE
FRIENDLY WITH EACH OTHER. MOST OF THE TIME HAHAH

DO YOU HAVE ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU PRIOR TO BUDS
AND WHATEVER YOU THINK LIFE CHANGING IS THAT’S WHAT I’M ASKING ABOUT? IF
YOU DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING THAT’S FINE TOO.

UM, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I ALMOST DIED IN A WHITE WATER RAFTING TRIP. EVER
SINCE THEN, I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING MORE.

HOW OLD WERE YOU?

I WAS 10. I THINK.

OKAY. BUT YOU STILL OBVIOUSLY LIKE THE WATER.

YEAH, IT WAS A VERY COLD, TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. MADE ME APPRECIATE COLD
WATER HAHAH

HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S?

UM, IT JUST SHOWED THERE’S WORSE THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. LIKE
THINKING ABOUT MY LITTLE BROTHER GOING THROUGH STUFF LIKE THAT AS WELL.
I DON’T KNOW I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE LIKE A PROTECTOR I GUESS.

HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR GETTING THROUGH
BUD/S? ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT’D YOU SAY OH YEAH THIS IS

YEAH, I’M JUST KIND OF LIKE, UH, A LITTLE BIT MORE CARELESS I GUESS.

AND DID THAT HELP YOU?

YES, CERTAINLY.

WHY?

I WAS SORT OF ABLE TO PUSH THINGS AWAY LIKE WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT
NEGATIVE STUFF

OKAY THAT HELPS.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND THAT EVEN LED YOU TO BECOME A SEAL. LIKE
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE IN THE MILITARY? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT WAS A SEAL?

YEAH, MY GRANDPA WAS IN VIETNAM. UH, AND MY BROTHER IS ARMY SPECIAL
FORCES. HE HAD A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON ME.

BUT YOU DIDN’T WANT TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING HE DID?

NO, HE DIDN’T LIKE IT. HE JUST GOT OUT. HE WAS NEVER GOOD IN THE WATER.
I WAS A SWIMMER AND I WAS PRETTY GOOD IN THE WATER. SO, I WANTED TO DO
THAT.

SO TELL ME ABOUT HOW YOUR PARENTS DISCIPLINED YOU AS A CHILD? DID THEY
SPANK YOU? GIVE YOU A TIMEOUT? DO THEY MAKE YOU RUN? WHAT WAS THE MOST?

I GOT SPANKED REALLY EARLY, BUT IT WAS MOSTLY LIKE AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME YOU KNOW IT WOULD GET TO ME. I NEVER WANTED TO DISAPPOINT THEM.

DID YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT AS A KID?

NO.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? DID YOU HAVE TEAM SPORTS THERE THAT
YOU DID OR WITH A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY?

YEAH, I WAS ON THE SWIM TEAM AND THE GOLF TEAM. I DIDN’T REALLY FIT IN
WITH THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE I WASN’T REALLY AS SMART AS THEM I GUESS.
THOSE WERE KIND OF THE SMARTER SPORTS LIKE VERSUS LIKE FOOTBALL OR
WRESTLING. BUT UH I REALLY ENJOYED BEING AROUND THOSE PEOPLE SO.

AND THAT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL? COLLEGE?

HIGH SCHOOL. I DIDN’T GO TO COLLEGE.

YOU HAVEN’T YET

YES.

WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S? LIKE
DID YOU GO STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

NOPE, I WAS WORKING A LOT. MY DAD OWNS A CONTRACTING COMPANY. HE BUILDS
HOUSES AND STORES AND STUFF. I GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE FROM THAT. I KNEW
IF I JOINED AT 18 I WASN’T MATURE ENOUGH YA KNOW. I DON’T THINK I WOULD
HAVE MADE IT THEN.

THAT’S MATURE. WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE LIKE DO YOU HAVE
TATTOOS OR DO YOU MAKE IMPULSIVE DECISIONS? DO YOU THINK?

UH SOMETIMES. I HAVE MY MOMENTS, YEAH. I HAVE A COUPLE TATTOOS.

CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE?

I GUESS ITS MOSTLY LIKE BUYING STUFF.

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? THINK ABOUT YOUR
HARDEST DAY, WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET THROUGH AND DO YOU THINK THE TEAM
HELPED YOU GET THROUGH?

MY WORST MOMENT WAS HELL WEEK. MONDAY NIGHT AND I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT MY
FAMILY AND I DIDN’T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN OR LET MYSELF DOWN. THAT WAS
REALLY ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT. BEING A GOOD ROLE MODEL TO MY LITTLE
BROTHER.

DID YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL PRACTICES THAT HELPED YOU
GET THROUGH?

NO, I MEAN I HAD IDEAS BUT ONCE YOU REALLY HIT THAT POINT THAT YOU WANT
TO QUIT THOSE DON’T REALLY MATTER.

WHAT HELPED YOU GET OVER AN IDEA? I MEAN I WOULD THINK EVERYONE IN THIS
PROGRAM WANTS TO QUIT AT SOMETIME BUT THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU
DO TO GET THROUGH THAT

JUST TALK TO YOURSELF. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. JUST POSITIVE MENTAL
ATTITUDE.

DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE DURING BUDS?
LIKE, YOU, A CLASSMATE CHEATING OR WHATEVER AND WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR
MIND? IF YOU HAD SOMETHING.

WE HAD A GUY THAT WAS LYING TO THE INSTRUCTORS ABOUT UH I GUESS HE HAD
DRUGS IN HIS TRUCK. IS WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE. WE HAD A CAR SEARCH AND
HE DIDN’T LIKE TELL THEM THAT HE HAD A VEHICLE. HE WAS IN MY BOAT CREW
AND HE WAS A REALLY GOOD GUY WE THOUGHT AND WE HAD TO TURN HIM IN AND HE
GOT DROPPED. THAT WAS PRETTY TOUGH TO SEE.

WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO DECIDE IF YOU WERE
GOING TO TURN HIM IN OR NOT?

I THOUGHT ABOUT LIKE HOW HARD HE PUT OUT AND UM LIKE WHAT HE DID FOR ME
DURING HELL WEEK. THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT WORKING WITH HIM IN THE FUTURE
AND DECISIONS LIKE THAT AND UH

AND JEOPARDIZING OTHERS

YUP. IT WAS PRETTY SELFISH OF HIM.

IF YOU HAD TO THINK ONE THING THAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS?

LIKE IN THE PIPELINE OR?

NO, JUST HERE AT BUDS.

UM, UH, I DONT KNOW.

LET ME ASK YOU A DIFFERENT WAY. WHAT SEPARATES YOU FROM THE PEOPLE THAT
QUIT. WHAT DID THE PEOPLE THAT QUIT, WHAT DID THEY NOT HAVE?

I GUESS CONFIDENCE MAYBE. OR OVERTHINKING. IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

OKAY. I DON'T KNOW. I BEG TO DIFFER. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE
CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? ARE YOU THE SAME GUY WHO WHEN YOU GRADUATE? YOU
ARE THE SAME GUY BUT WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE DECEMBER 2018?

I’M MORE DISCIPLINED DEFINITELY. BUT I HAVE UH A MORE CARELESS ATTITUDE
I GUESS. ITS WEIRD LIKE.

OR MAYBE. YOURE SAYING CARELESS. DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU DON'T TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY?

YES, I DON'T TAKE THINGS AS SERIOUSLY, BUT I AM DEFINITELY MORE
DISCIPLINED. IT SOUNDS CONTRADICTORY BUT I DON'T KNOW.

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU THAT WILL HELP THE
NAVY BETTER PICK PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN BUDS?

I DON’T THINK SO. NO.

OKAY. AWESOME.

AND THEN COULD YOU TELL ME YOUR PARTICIPANT ID

109

AND I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO RECORD

YES YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO RECORD

OK, LET ME START WITH HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

I HAVE FIVE SIBLINGS

FIVE

FIVE SIBLINGS

PLUS YOU

PLUS ME

OK SO CAN YOU GIVE ME THE ORDER AND AGES AND BROTHERS OR SISTERS

YA MY OLDEST SISTER IS 36

OK

NEXT IS 32

SISTER

SISTER 32

OK

I’M 25, UH YOUNGER BROTHERS 23, UH NEXT SISTER IS 21 NEXT SISTER IS
18, 19

OK, AND ALL FROM THE SAME PARENTS

NO MY TWO OLDER SISTERS ARE STEP SISTERS

OK BUT DID YOU LIVE WITH THEM AT ALL

YES WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THEY LIVED WITH US UNTIL I WAS LIKE TEN
YEARS OLD

OK AND THEN YOU LIVED WITH YOUR MOTHER

YES AND THEN I LIVED WITH THE REST OF MY

OK UM UNTIL TEN, OK IF YOU THINK OF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES, CHILDHOOD,
TEENAGE YEARS, WHAT MIGHT YOU DESCRIBE AS YOUR CRUCIBLE OR LIFE CHANGING
EXPERIENCES

LETS SEE SO I MOVED UH WHEN I WAS TEN WE MOVED TO RENO SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA AND THEN UH I’D SAY THE BIGGEST ONE WAS WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN IT
WAS ABOUT 2008 I BELIEVE BOTH MY PARENTS LOST THEIR JOBS AND WE HAD TO
MOVE IN WITH UH RELATIVES BACK DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

YA

SO THAT WAS PROBABLY THE CRAZIEST THING THAT HAPPENED

OK

YA I WAS PRETTY I WAS PRETTY FORTUNATE UNTIL ABOUT THEN I WAS ABOUT
13 YEARS OLD OR 14 15, I WAS PRETTY PRIVILEGED UNTIL I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS
OLD

YA, HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCES AT BUDS?

WELL I LEARNED A LOT FROM MY PARENTS MY PARENTS KINDA FOUND WORK
MULTIPLE JOBS KINDA FOUND DIFFERENT WAYS FOR US TO KINDA BE ABLE TO DO
THE THINGS THAT OUR FRIENDS WERE DOING LIKE PLAYING BASEBALL GOING ON
TRIPS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THEY KINDA SACRIFICED A LOT SO WE COULD A
HAVE THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED

OK

AND THEN UH IT WAS FOR MY SIBLINGS IT WAS A LITTLE HARDER THEM TO
SEE BUT FOR ME I KINDA SAW WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEHIND THE SCENES, STUFF
LIKE THAT UM, SO YA I’D DEFINITELY SAY A LITTLE I GOT MOST OF KINDA THAT
EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO IS BIGGER THAN YOU I GOT THAT FROM MY PARENTS

OK

AND THEY NEVER MADE AN EXCUSE THEY NEVER COMPLAINED THEY KINDA JUST
UHH THEY KINDA JUST WORKED AND WORKED MULTIPLE JOBS AND DIDN’T SLEEP AND
DIDN’T EAT JUST FOR US AND THAT WAS REALLY INSPIRING AND THAT KINDA
CONTINUED KINDA STILL LIKE TODAY KINDA THE SAME WAY BT

YA, HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR PROGRESSION
THROUGH BUDS

I GUESS I’M MORE KIND OF A QUIET AND I KINDA JUST WANT TO I’M ALSO
COMPETITIVE AND DEFINITELY THROUGH BUDS IT'S KINDA IT’S KINDA THE THING
WHERE UH YOU ARE ALWAYS YOU DON’T YOU WANNA DO BETTER THAN THE GUY NEXT
TO YOU LIKE ESPECIALLY WITH A LOT OF LIKE THE GUYS HERE LIKE SOME OF THE
GUYS I’VE GONE STRAIGHT THROUGH WITH IT’S KINDA LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I’M
NOT GONNA LET YOU MAKE IF I’M NOT GONNA MAKE IT WE STARTED KINDA
ATTITUDE AND YOU KINDA STARTED DEVELOPING THAT IN BOOT CAMP, THE SAME
GUYS I HUNG OUT WITH IN BOOT CAMP ARE THE SAME GUYS I HANG OUT WITH NOW
AND IT’S FUNNY HOW THAT WORKED OUT

YA

CAUSE THERES A BUNCH OF LITTLE CLICKS WHEN YOU FIRST GET THERE AND
YOU KINDA SEE UM YOU KNOW THOSE SAME PEOPLE AND CLICKS AND I DON’T KNOW
HOW THAT

SO GOING BACK TO BEING THIS ON YOUR PERSONALITY

OH YA

IS IT A LOYALTY TO FRIENDS

YA LOYALTY IT’S DEFINITELY A LOYALTY FOR ME

CAUSE I’M GONNA ASK ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOUR FRIENDS HERE IN A
SECOND, DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND IN BECOMING PART OF THE UH SEAL
COMMUNITY

SO I PLAYED SPORTS MY WHOLE LIKE, I PLAYED BASKETBALL IN COLLEGE,
UH

AT DIV UH

IT WAS A DIVISION TWO UNIVERSITY

OK

UH ALWAYS HAD YOU KNOW THAT WANT TO COMPETE AND I’VE ALWAYS BEEN
PASSIONATE ABOUT SERVING MY COUNTRY

OK

AND UH OBVIOUSLY THE SEAL COMMUNITY IS KINDA THAT TIER ONE
COMMUNITY THAT YOU WANT TO BE APART IN THE MILITARY AND IT’S SOMETHING
THAT THAT I JUST WANTED TO BE APART OF

OK CAN YOU TELL ME A BIT ABOUT AND YOU DID TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT
YOUR CHILDHOOD AND YOUR MOVING BUT IM INTERESTED IN YOUR LIKE FAMILY’S
PARENTING STYLE, PARTICULARLY DISCIPLINE, SO

OK

SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF KIDS UH YOU KNOW SPANKING

YA SPANKING

OK

SPANKING, IT WAS DEFINITELY MORE OF TOUGH LOVE

OK

LEARN QUICKLY HOW TO NOT GET CAUGHT DOING THINGS

OK UM SO IS THIS HAND ON BUTT OR BELT, IS THIS PADDLE IS THIS

AH THIS IS WOODEN SPOON YA THE WOODEN SPOON

OK WOODEN SPOON, HOW ABOUT SOAP IN THE MOUTH

UH YA THEY USED TO MOUTH I NEVER GOT IT BUT THEY DEFINITELY DID GET
SOAP IN THE MOUTH

OK UM AND THEN LIKE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN UP TO BEFORE BUDS, AND WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE

YES YA I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF IMPULSIVE DEFINITELY

OK UM

THE FACT THAT I ENLISTED IN THE MILITARY WAS A VERY IMPULSIVE
DECISION

OK

YA IT WAS SOMETHING I HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLANNING ON DOING BUYT

OK

THE DECISION DEFINITELY WASN’T CALCULATED, IT WAS JUST ONE DAY I
WALKED INTO THE OFFICE AND ENLISTED

OK DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS

NO

OK HOW ABOUT SPEEDING TICKETS

NO SPEEDING TICKETS

OK UM SO THE DECISION TO ENLIST WAS KINDA A BIG IMPULSIVE

YES

CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF BEING IMPULSIVE

UHHHHH LETS SEE SO UH I HAD BEEN OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS TO GO PLAY
BASKETBALL AND UH I GUESS THE DAY THAT I SIGNED TO GO TO THE SCHOOL THAT
I WENT TO I KINDA JUST SICK OF WAITING AROUND AND I JUST WANTED TO SIGN
SO I JUST SIGNED, I WANTED TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA IT WASN’T NECESSARILY
AS GOOD OF A SCHOOL IT WASN’T A DIVISION ONE SCHOOL THAT I WANTED BUT I
JUST MADE THE DECISION TO SIGN AND NOT WAIT TO TRY AND GET SOMETHING
BETTER SO THAT WAS KINDA AN IMPULSIVE DECISION.

WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

UM WELL SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY YOU NOW UH GRAD GETTING TO A SEAL
TEAM AND DEPLOYING IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL YOU KNOW BUD;S AT FIRST NOW IT’S
NOT ONLY GETTING TO A SEAL TEAM BUT BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING
IN A POSITIVE WAY ONCE YOU GET TO A SEAL TEAM

SO BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE

YA IT’S MORE THAN JUST GETTING THERE BEING AN ASSET

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S, THIS IS A HOLISTIC
QUESTION SO THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT UM WHAT WAS THE MOST
CHALLENGING

I GUESS THE MOST THE MOST CHALLENGING THING IS PROBABLY WHEN UH I
GUESS IT WAS KINDA LOSE FOCUS AND LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE INSTEAD OF
FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUAL TASKS THAT YOU WERE DOING, LIKE DURING HELL WEEK
IF IT WAS SUNDAY NIGHT OF HELL WEEK YOU WERE LIKE JESUS I HAVE FIVE MORE
DAYS OF THIS I DON’T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT, THAT’S WHEN YOU HAVE TO
RECOGNIZE THAT NEGATIVE SMALL TALK AND SORT OF LOOK AT THE SMALL PICTURE
FOR ME I GUESS DURING HELL WEEK I CAN KINDA REMEMBER UM FOCUSING ON UH
YOU KNOW ONE STEP AT A TIME RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE AND
EVEN WHEN YOU FINISH HELL WEEK AND THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE
TO DO IT’S STILL KINDA OVERWHELMING IT'S KINDA JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME
GETTING THROUGH OC8, GETTING THROUGH YOUR PISTOL QUAL, GETTING THROUGH
YOUR RIFLE QUAL

YA

SO

ITS ALL THAT COMPARTMENTALIZATION

YA

WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH HELL WEEK IN
PARTICULAR

YA MY BUDDY, I DIDN’T WANT HIM TO GET THROUGH AND I DIDN’T GET
THROUGH I DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL MY FAMILY THAT I QUIT

OK

UM THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MAIN THING WAS EMBARRASSING MY FAMILY MOST
OF ALL AND HAVING TO PUT MY HELMET ON THE GRINDER

OK

AND HAVING MY NAME OUT THERE

SO WHEN YOU YOUR BUDDY IS IT COMPETITION WITH THE BUDDY

YA IT’S COMPETITION

OK

THAT’S KINDA MORE OF A THE THAT'S PART OF IT DEFINITELY

DO YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP IS THERE ENCOURAGEMENT

YA DEFINITELY DEFINITELY

OK UHHH IS THERE ANY OTHER PRACTICES WHETHER ITS PHYSICAL MENTAL OR
SPIRITUAL THAT YOU USE TO GET YOU THROUGH CHALLENGING TIMES, PRAYER,
MEDITATION, STRETCHING

YES I DO PRAY

YOU DO PRAY

UM STRETCHING NOT SO MUCH

SOME ATHLETES WILL DO A PREGAME RITUAL

SO LIKE YA I GUESS THIS WAS MORE OF A SECOND DIVING THING BUT
VISUALIZATION

OK

DEFINITELY IS HUGE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

OK

YA UM VISUALIZATION

WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION

UM LET’S SEE UH HOW IS IT GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE AROUND ME SO IS
THAT IS THIS MORE LIKE A TACTICAL DECISION

UH DID YOU CAN YOU RECALL CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A TOUGH
DECISION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF BUD/S AND KINDA TALK ME THROUGH IT

YA SO BUD/S YOU ARE MOSTLY TOLD WHAT TO DO

RIGHT

AND YOU KINDA DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD IT’S KINDA ONCE YOU GET OUT TO
THE ISLAND YOU START MAKING DECISIONS LIKE ON YOUR OWN LIKE I MEAN
DECISIONS PUTTING OBVIOUSLY BUT DECISIONS THE DECISIONS TO CUT CORNERS
RIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT INSTEAD OF THE
DECISION TO DO SOMETHING WHERE YOU COULD CUT A CORNER IT’S MORE OF LIKE
IS THIS GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S DAY HARDER I GUESS I MEAN THAT;S
PROBABLY WHAT MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY HERE THAT THEY HOLD THEY HOLD THEIR
CLASSMATES IN VERY HIGH REGARD AND THEY DON’T WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO UH
KINDA HAVE THESE GUYS LOOK DOWN ON YOU I MEAN THEY SAY YOU ARE
CONSTANTLY BEING EVALUATED EVEN IF THE INSTRUCTORS AREN’T THERE

RIGHT YA

WE’RE EVALUATING EACH OTHER ON SOMETHING

ALRIGHT UMMM WHY DO YOU THINK IN COMPLETING BUD/S AND WHY DO YOU
THINK OTHERS WERE NOT

MATURITY I THINK I I I UH LIVED ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS 18 MOVED OUT
WENT TO COLLEGE GRADUATED GOT MY OWN PLACE PAYING BILLS STUFF LIKE THAT
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME YOUNG GUYS HERE BUT THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO GET OUT ON THEIR OWN THEY DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE
CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON’T IF YOU DON’T I MEAN I KNEW I
KNEW THAT MAKING IT THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND HAVING TO GO OUT TO THE
FLEET I KNEW THAT HOW BAD THAT COULD BE AND

OK

AND UH I DON’T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OR WHAT
CAN HAPPEN IF YOU DON’T WORK HARD OR YOU KNOW APPLY YOURSELF AND FINISH
WHAT YOU START

DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DIDN;T MAKE IT WHAT DID
THEY HAVE IN COMMON

UMMM SELFISH I THINK I THINK THEY CARED MORE ABOUT THEMSELVES THEN
THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM

OK

UMM WHEN THINGS GOT BAD THINGS GOT SCARY THEY FELT SORRY FOR
THEMSELVES THEY DIDN’T REALLY CARE HOW ANYONE ELSE WAS FEELING OR YA

YA

I THINK THEY DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE

OK (LONG PAUSE) HOW DID YOU CHANGE AS A PERSON

UMM CONFIDENCE WISE I AM MORE CONFIDENT NOW DEFINITELY UM KINDA
LEARN THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT EVERYTHING YOU CAN DEVELOP
THAT SKILL DEVELOP UM WAYS TO GET OVER OBSTACLES AND STUFF LIKE THAT UMM
IT YOU KNOW IS WEIRD THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HOW LIKE UNSURE
YOU WERE OF LIKE LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN GOING TO BOOT CAMP LIKE SHOULD I BE
HERE YOU HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS OBVIOUSLY THAT GO THROUGH YOUR HEAD BUT
THEN EVERY TIME YOU UH GET OVER THAT NEXT TEST OR NEXT OBSTACLE YOU’RE
LIKE I’VE DONE THIS BEFORE I CAN DO IT AGAIN EASIER SAID THAN DONE
PEOPLE SAY THAT TO YOU BEFORE BUT UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IT

WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT I DIDN’T COVER UH THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

NO YOU PRETTY MUCH HIT EVERYTHING

OK OK GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH

AWESOME

Um Yep and I’ll hit Record here. And then Uh Do I have your permission
to Record

Of Course

Ok and can you tell me participant ID numbers and why you have two of
them there?

Um the first one is 10 and second one is 3049 that’s because I got
rolled out of a previous class.

Ok and when did you start your BUD/S Class? Your First BUD/S Class?

June 10^(th) 2019.

And is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yes

Um so let’s talk about your family uh are you…do you have siblings?

I’m one of five.

Ok and can you tell me where you fall in the birth order and if its
brothers and sisters?

My oldest is an older brother and then there’s me and then a younger
sister, younger brother, younger sister.

Big Family?

Yeah.

These are all one set of parents..?

Yes

…No stepsisters or brothers. Were your parents married?

Yes.

Ok and uh how long have they been married?

[pause]…twenty years…

How’s your relationship with them?

Great, I’m really close with both of them.

And relationship with your siblings?

Really close with them as well.

Ok good, any life changing events that happened prior to coming to
BUD/S?

Umm my senior year of High School, my best friend killed himself. Umm
other than that no.

Im sorry.

Its ok.

That sounds really hard. Um do you think that factors into your
experience at BUD/S? How often do you think about him?

Um I mean I definitely think about him for sure….um….it definitely keeps
me going in the mindset of like I don’t wanna grow up and not be
anything I wanna be a good man like he was so…I don’t know…I look up to
him because he was a really great guy and so….I don’t wanna go down a
rabbit hole and not be anything with my life.

So you feel this obligation to honor his legacy?

Right.

Ok….What was his name?

John

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression after
BUD/S?

I think it worked out pretty well because…Im not much of a downer so it
worked out.

So you have a overall positive mental…

Yes

Attitude. Ok anything else in terms of…?

I just don’t want to quit [laughs] I don’t know

Ok so you have a tenacity?

Yes. Headstrong.

Describe your background that lead you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL community. So do you have any SEALs that are family of friends?

No no. I don’t know anyone in the teams other than the instructors that
are here.

Anyone in your family military at all?

My brother joined just before I did to go to the Air Force to be in the
Military Police. Other than that no. We were the first two.

So what gave you the idea?

Um growing my dad had always talked about how he wished he would have
joined because it would have set him up for his life for his family and
so that was my idea. I wanted to join so I had a good base to start off
of.

So he encouraged to join the military in general?

Right.

So why SEALs?

Um they offered it to me at MEPS and I went with it.

And you thought why not?

Pretty much yeah.

So lets some more about your childhood and how you were disciplined, so
what was your parents parenting style?

I had very, very good parents, they were strict but they also let me
learn. So like [pause] anytime anything happened they were like ok if
you’re going to do that its going to suck. Like…that’s how it was. Um
very, very good parenting.

Were you spanked when you were younger?

Yes.

And as you get older how was the discipline? Was it like take away your
video games or take away your phone?

Take away phone and car and [pause]

Privileges?

Yes.

But there was also this sort of go out and make mistakes in a sort of
safe environment…

Right.

..and learn from it?

Right.

Did you move around during your childhood?

No. I moved like three different house but it was all…

Same Area?

Yeah.

So you didn’t have to move schools..

No

…or friend groups?

No. Same school entire childhood.

And then in your teenage years did you do sports or activities?

Yes. I played football, ran cross country, um wrestled and played
baseball.

A lot sports.

Yeah.

Any…what would you say was your dominant sport?

Wrestling for sure.

How many years?

Um 3

And then in the five years before BUD/S can you tell me what you were
doing?

Going to high school and working.

What were you working?

Ummm landscaping.

Ok. Like out in the projects?

No we had our…its…called Pawn Pro Shop, its like professional built
ponds like we would go to people’s backyards and build a pond swan. And
I ran, we had 14 different ponds and with all sorts of different koi
fish and stuff like that inside of them. And I just ran the entire yard
and kept it clean and pretty.

Well…any college?

No

And then you…what was the inspiration to then enlist. Your dad said
military service would be a good opportunity?

He talks about it would be a good way to start out your life, like a
good base, to start off of and so I ran with it.

Ok, would you consider yourself impulsive?

No, for the most part I think things over before I do it.

Do you have any tattoos that you got on a whim?

I have one tattoo but that was because my buddy John died. That was in
memory of him, so I guess that was a little bit impulsive. But that’s
the only thing.

Yeah but you didn’t have some drinks and then…

No.

Speeding tickets?

No

Uh…uh…big purchases. You see a car and you want to buy it?

No

What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? So it could have been
a day, an event. Could have been a theme like water or logs?

Um for me it was the pressure chamber. I just had a hard time clearing
my ears.

So it was physically uncomfortable?

Yeah…physically, trying, they just wouldn’t clear. That’s what I got
rolled for. Just couldn’t clear my ears.

So how was that experience of getting rolled? Was that challenging? Sort
of having to realize you were going to have to redo some of the…?

I didn’t really have to redo anything and it was kind of nice, because I
got a break and time to heal and then just trying to get ready to go
back into it… so it worked out for me.

So that doesn’t really sound like a challenge…I mean your thing…what was
really hard for you?

I just literally couldn’t clear my ears that was the only hard thing.

In the whole experience of BUD/S, that’s it?

That’s it.

Ok

Yeah, I didn’t really have a problem with anything else.

Ok, what motivates you? What gets you through hard things? When things
are challenging?

[Pause] I don’t know. I just don’t want to quit. I was raised right and
then like [pause] I feel like I have a good family name back home, like
a lot of people know my dad, and my dad’s dad and all that. I don’t want
to disrespect the name.

Ok. Do you have a practice? Like a physical, mental, or spiritual thing
that you use to push through challenges? So some guys talk about prayer
or mantra or like meditation or like visualization exercise? Do you do
anything like that.

No

So you just show up and perform?

That’s it [both laugh] Simple dude.

What are you thinking about when you’re under the log or in the boat,
you know the grind?

Just thinking about my share of the weight so nobody else does.

When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through
your mind when you made that decision? Can you give me an example of a
decision that you really struggled with? For example running classmates
out?

Um one of the hard ones is during PREP I got close with a guy that I
came out here with and I ended up having to run him out of the boat
because he just wasn’t carrying his weight, he was dragging everyone
else down. He was just a liability at that point. So it was rough but
after 2 days of it I had enough, so I just told everyone I’m don’t and
[sic] and I ran him out twice.

So whyd you make that decision?

Because I was looking around and I knew how my body felt and I knew it
wasn’t just because the circumstances, this was hell week, I knew that
he was dragging the boat down he was not carrying his weight he was just
hurting the other guys from the boat crew.

So you did what was best for the boat crew?

Yeah and it sucked because I knew him, good dude.

Why do you think you were successful at BUD/S

Just do what the instructors say, then it won’t be as bad.

Ok what did you notice about guys that did make it?

Good group of dudes, good attitude. They know whats right and whats
wrong and don’t quit. Everybody else that end up not making it, the
turds, they try to get away with stuff and cheat through, nobody here
does that. Good group of dudes.

Do you think this experience has changed you?

I think so. It definitely makes me appreciate more things.

Anything else that I didn’t ask that you think would be insightful for
us? Trying to figure out what makes a successful candidate.

I feel like a lot of it has to do with childhood and how they were
raised. Cause if you were raised in a really shitty
situation…you…you…theres nothing to fall back on. And whenever I look
back I have my family name that I want to live up to. Um I just want to
make a good imprint on that name. I got a great family behind me if I
ever need them. I don’t ever…I would never want to tell my dad, hey I
failed, I didn’t make it. And so if you don’t have somebody to look
back, look up to like that then I can see how it would be hard for them.

Ok great. Good stuff

 (SIO): DO YOU HAVE ANY SIBLINGS?

YES.

HOW MANY, AND CAN YOU GIVE ME LIKE THE BIRTH ORDER, AGES, BROTHER,
SISTERS…

OKAY, SO, ALL OF THEM ARE HALF SISTERS

OK

AND THEN ALAYNA IS 27 (THIS PHRASE WAS LONG AND DRAWN OUT, SOUNDING
UNSURE)

OK, AND DID YOU LIVE WITH ANY OR ALL OF THEM WHEN YOU WERE GROWING
UP?

I LIVED WITH ALAYNA, MY UH

OK GOT IT, GOT IT

I SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID THREE OLDER SISTERS SHOULDN’T I?

NO, SO WE’RE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS FAMILY DYNAMIC

OH

UM, BUT I’LL STOP WITH THAT THERE SO IF YOU THINK OF YOUR LIFE
EXPERIENCES WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS YOUR CRUCIBLE OR LIFE SHAPING
EXPERIENCES? (SLIGHT PAUSE) HAVE YOU HAD ANY?

HMM,

SHAPED, SHAPE ME A LITTLE BIT, YES

OK

IT WAS DIFFICULT AT FIRST, IT KINDA YOU KNOW GIVES YOU, HELPS YOU
FIGURE OUT TIME MANAGEMENT, STUFF LIKE THAT

YA

SO THAT, WOULD THAT HELP SHAPE A LOT OF THINGS

OK, SO WHEN I, THE NEXT QUESTION,

 HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S?

WOULD YOU SAY TIME MANAGEMENT…

I’D SAY, SO THE FIRST SEMESTER I SHOW UP TO COLLEGE I HAD NO IDEA
WHATS GOING ON, I’M LIKE OH THIS IS NOT FOR ME, THIS IS JUST

OK

CHAOTIC, AND THEN IT GOT, THEN YOU’D FIGURE IT OUT, YOU’D FIGURE OUT
A SCHEDULE AND THEN YOU’RE FINE AND THEN THE NEXT SEMESTER ITS LIKE OH
HEY I’M FREAKIN OUT AGAIN CAUSE I DON’T KNOW ALL THE TIME MANAGEMENT
STUFF

YA

BUT THE SECOND TIME YOU KNOW YOU’RE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT CAUSE YOU
ALREADY DID IT ONCE SO AND THEN EVERY SEMESTER FROM THEN ON IS JUST
EASIER AND EASIER AND EASIER

SO WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT

SO, I DON’T KNOW, YOU HAVE A WORD FOR IT BUT I DON’T THINK I DO.

AH LIKE CONFIDENCE

YA YOU START TO BUILD CONFIDENCE

OK

AND YOUR ABILITIES TO DEAL WITH THINGS

OK

SO UM YA, THAT THAT DIRECTLY TRANSLATES OVER INTO BUD/S BECAUSE YOU
SHOW UP TO BUD/S AND YOU’RE JUST BOMBARDED

YA

BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU’LL FIII, III ITS LIKE BEING AT BUD/S IS GONNA
STAY HARD BUT IT WILL GET EASIER CAUSE YOU’LL UNDERSTAND YOU’LL YA KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

YEP. SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU’LL FIGURE IT OUT

YA I MEAN YOU YOUR EITHER GOING TO OR YOUR NOT AND

OK

GOING THROUGH THOSE EXPERIENCES

YA

NOW YOU KNOW THAT WHAT I’M CAPABLE SO ITS KINDA JUST A CHOICE

YHOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UMM, (SHORT PAUSE) WELL I HAVE, I I I I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF
HUMOR

OK

AND THAT IS, THAT WAS

SELF DECLARED?

I MEAN I I I HAVE MOST OF THE TIME JUST YA KNOW KIND OF KEEPING
MYSELF ENTERTAINED

OK

SOOO I DON’T KNOW, THEY THEY HATE IT BUT

OK

ITS ITS HOW I DEAL WITH THINGS

OK, ANYTHING ELSE?

UM (SHORT PAUSE) UM LIKE PRETTY

SO PERSONALITY UM, IT IS YOUR PERSONAL TRAITS RIGHT, THAT WOULD
PREDICT YOUR BEHAVIOR FOR YOURSELF, RIGHT, KIND OF TALKING ABOUT, UH YOU
KNOW, I KNOW THAT I’LL FIGURE THIS OUT CAUSE I KNOW WHAT I’VE DONE
BEFORE

RIGHT

AND AS ALSO AN EXTERNAL VIEW HOW DO OTHERS ANTICIPATE WHAT YOU’RE
GONNA DO RIGHT?

OK

SO

USUALLY THEY CAN’T ANTICIPATE WHAT I’M GONNA DO BUT I MEAN I’M
FAIRLY CONFIDENT

OK

UM SO THAT’S HUGE

YA

AND IF YOU YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF BUT I’M ALSO NOT LIKE COCKY
BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA, YOU KNOW THIS IS LIKE A 50 50 IN A WAY

YA

FOR FOR ME ITS ITS LIKE OH WE’LL SEE, HOPEFULLY I MAKE IT, YOU KNOW
SO

RIGHT

I DON’T HOW TO PUT IN ANY OTHER TRAITS (WHAT I THINK HE SAID, WORDS
HARD TO UNDERSTAND)

UM, NOT TO GIVE YOU A LECTURE ON IT BUT DID WE HAVE OPENNESS, UHH,
AGREEABLENESS, CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, EXTROVERSION, AND NEUROTICISM

EXTROVERSION

YOU’RE EXTROVERTED

YA I’D SAY SO

OK, THAT’S WHERE YOU GET YOUR ENERGY FROM OTHER PEOPLE

YA

YOU SEEK OTHER PEOPLE OUT AND WANT TO BE IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS

YES

OK

I GUESS I DO SOMETIMES

GREAT, UM,

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING A PART OF
THE SEAL COMMUNITY.

SO DID YOU COME FROM A MILITARY FAMILY, DID YOU COME FROM

NO I, I WOULDN’T CALL IT A MILITARY FAMILY, I’VE HAD PEOPLE IN MY
FAMILY THAT WERE IN THE MILITARY BUT MY DAD WASN’T IN THE MILITARY, MY
MOM WASN’T IN THE MILITARY, NOTHING LIKE THAT. MY DAD’S KINDA MORE LIKE
IF IT DOESN’T BOTHER HIM HE DOESN’T WANT TO MESS WITH IT YOU KNOW AND SO

SO IS THERE ANYTHING, LIKE WHY THE SEALS?

SO I MET SOME SEALS

OK

UM AND I HAVE JUST BEEN IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEALS IN
THEIR FAMILY, LIKE I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH A GUY WHOSE SON WAS A SEAL AND
THIS GUY WAS LIKE AN A TYPE PERSONALITY AND HE’D ALREADY HAD A CAREER,
RETIRED

OK

HE JUST WAS GOING BACK, HE WENT TO A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL FIRST SO HE
WAS LIKE JUST TRYING TO LEARN STUFF AND LIKE SEEING HIM AND TALKING TO
HIM ABOUT HIS SON AND ALL THAT STUFF IT REALLY OPENED UP IT OPENED UP
LIKE THIS OTHER WORLD THAT I DIDN’T KNOW EXISTED CASUE I’M LIKE FROM A
REALLY SMALL TOWN AND YOU PRETTY MUCH YOU GET A HOUSE, YOU GET A WIFE,
YOU GET TRUCK AND YOU GET A JOB AND YOU STAY THERE FOR THE REST OF YOUR
LIFE AND THAT’S IT SO TALKING TO HIM ABOUT POSSIBILITIES AND STUFF WAS
JUST HUGE AND THEN ALSO UH THERE WAS SOME SEALS THEY WERE UH DOING LIKE
TRAINING AT FORT KNOX IN KENTUCKY AND THEY ENDED UP BECOMING FRIENDS
WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS FATHERS AND THEY CAME AND HUNG OUT WITH US A LOT
ON THE WEEKENDS WHEN THEY HAD THE WEEKENDS OFF FROM TRAINING AND JUST
TALKING TO THEM, PICKING THEIR BRAIN AND I WAS LIKE OH, THESE, THESE ARE
THE GUYS, THE GUYS I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YA.

OK, YA

YA LETS DO IT.

OK

 TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. UM. I’M PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED IN YOUR FAMILY’S STYLE OF PARENTING AND DISCIPLINE. SO UH,
SPANKING, VERSUS TIMEOUT VERSUS SOAP

OK

IN THE MOUTH VERSUS TAKING AWAY UH YOU KNOW TOYS OR PLAYSTATIONS,
VIDEO GAMES, THINGS LIKE THAT.

OK, SO I WAS A PRETTY WILD KID UM AND I GOT IN, I GOT IN A LOT OF
TROUBLE BUT IT WASN’T LIKE LEGIT TROUBLE IT WAS JUST, I WAS ALWAYS JUST
DOING STUFF

OK

YOU KNOW, I WAS PRETTY HYPER SO I DON’T KNOW, I’D LIKE TO GIVE A
STATUS QUO

OK

LIKE IF THEY ARE TELLING ME TO GET IN LINE IN SCHOOL LIKE FOR NO
REASON THEN I’M LIKE

WAS THIS TO AN AUTHORITY

YA, IN A WAY

OK, TESTING BOUNDARIES?

YES IN WAY, NOT ANYMORE NOT ANYMORE

SO WERE YOU LOCKED UP IN JUVI OR ANYTHING

NO NO NO, IT WAS, LIKE I SAID, IT WASN’T EVER REAL TROUBLE

OK

IT WAS, I WAS A GOOD KID

OK, SO TIMEOUT AT HOME?

THEY LET ME, MY PARENTS LET ME MAKE MY MISTAKES

OK

AND SO LIKE I’VE BEEN SPANKED YES UM, I’VE BEEN YOU KNOW SMACKED
WHENEVER I MOUTH OFF YOU KNOW

UH HUH

ON THE PLAYGROUND

SO OCCASIONAL CORPORAL PUNISHMENT WE’LL SAY

YES BUT UM I I WAS NEVER LIKE LEGITIMATELY GROUNDED OR ANYTHING UM
BUT I I MEAN I ENDED UP BEING A GOOD KID, I NEVER HAD ANY OH BAD
INTENTIONS OR ANYTHING

SURE

I WAS NEVER LIKE LIKE JUVENILE LIKE NOTHING LIKE THAT

OK

THAT’S NEXT LEVEL, I NEVER GOT INTO LIKE DRUGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

OK

I JUST, WHENEVER I WAS YOUNGER JUST I WAS JUST HYPER

OK UM SO DID YOU GUYS MOVE AROUND DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN TEAM SPORTS
OR ANY ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HAVE A CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY

UM WE DID NOT, WE DID NOT MOVE AROUND, I’VE LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN
ALL MY LIFE UM I UH PLAYED BASEBALL IN THE SUMMERS WHEN I WAS A KID

OK

AND THEN I GOT INTO SOCCER AND SOCCER WAS WHERE I REALLY STARTED TO
LIKE THAT THAT CLICKED WITH ME, LIKE BASEBALL MEH

OK

NEVER CLICKED FOR ME

OK, DID YOU PLAY SOCCER AT HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE

YA HIGH SCHOOL

OK ANY SPORTS IN COLLEGE

I DID LIKE, I WENT TO A, THIS MAY BE LAUGHABLE BUT I WENT TO A
CROSSFIT GYM FOR AWHILE AND THE COMMUNITY THERE WAS OUTSTANDING, JUST
AWESOME, SUPER COMPETITIVE GREAT UM I DID TAE KWONDO FOR TWELVE YEARS SO
I WAS AROUND ALL THAT BUT THAT MORE THE INDIVIDUAL TYPE YOU KNOW

SO TWELVE YEARS

YA

OK, AWESOME, SO LIKE THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, PRIOR TO
COMING TO BUD/S UM WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO, WERE YOU GOING TO SCHOOL,
WERE YOU TRAVELING

YES I UH SO I WORKED IN A MACHINE SHOP THROUGHOUT

OK

THAT ENTIRE TIME I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE, I DID LIKE TWO YEARS AT A
SORT OF VOCATIONAL COLLEGE

OK

I HAVE TWO ASSOCIATES DEGREES, ONE IN PRECISION MACHINING, ONE IN
ADVANCED CNC MACHINING AND THEN FROM THERE I WENT AND GOT MY BACHELORS
FROM PURDUE IN INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY

OK

AND UM THROUGHOUT ALL THAT I WAS WORKING AND THEN I WAS, AFTER THAT
I WAS I TOOK LIKE A YEAR TO WHERE I WAS JUST WORKING AND TRAINING AND
THAT THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT AND THEN I SIGNED UP

OK WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE, DO YOU JUMP INTO THINGS,
LIKE THE DECISION TO ENLIST OR SIGN UP WAS THAT IMPULSIVE

I KNEW THAT I WAS GONNA, I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO BUT IF YOU DON’T
HAVE THAT IMPULSE LIKE SOME PEOPLE

OK

UM SO I THINK THE DECISION THE DECISION FOR ME TO JOIN AT THAT TIME
I I PLANNED ON JOING AT THAT TIME A WHILE BACK BUT

OK

THE DECISION WAS KIND OF IMPULSIVE IN WAY TOO SO IT WAS WEIRD

OK DO YOU UM HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

I HAVE ONE TATTOO

OK, WHEN DID YOU GET IT

I GOT IT WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

OK, WAS THAT IMPULSIVE

NO

UHH DO YOU HAVE ANY SPEEDING TICKETS OR OTHER SORT OF RECKLESS
BEHAVIOR

UH I HAVE ONE SPEEDING TICKET

UH OK, IS IT BAD

NO

OK

IT WAS JUST FUNNY

UM WHAT ABOUT, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS

(12 SECOND PAUSE) SO THERE ARE LIKE YOU KNOW CLICHE ANSWERS THAT ARE
STILL BASICALLY TRUE UM YOU KNOW COMING IN HERE AND BEING WITH THESE
GUYS ONCE I’M HERE IS HUGE LIKE IT’S YOU CAN’T BE UNMOTIVATED BEING
AROUND THIS CALIBER OF PERSON UM YOU NOW NOT NOT INCLUDING MYSELF THESE
GUYS ARE JUST INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW I AM VERY VERY UH ITS VERY HUMBLING TO
WORK WITH THEM UM BUT I WOULD SAY LEGITIMATELY JUST LIKE THE UH
PATRIOTISM AND LIKE THERE IS A CONFLICT OF GOOD AND EVIL IN THE WORLD
100% AND I THINK THE FACT LIKE IF IF YOU KNOW YOU DON’T DO ANYTHING WHEN
YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABLE AND ARE IN A POSITION UM ESPECIALLY BEING IN THIS
POSITION YOU’RE GONNA BE DIRECTLY TASKED WITH TAKING CARE OF SOME
SERIOUS ISSUES LIKE MITIGATING THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT EVIL CAN DO FOR
THIS WAY OF LIFE. SO THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFES VERY MOTIVATING TOO AND
SOME PEOPLE DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING AND ITS GREAT CAUSE YOU
WANT TO PRESERVE THAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. UM

YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF

100% BECAUSE YA BECAUSE I THINK HUMAN BEINGS, WELL I CAN’T SAY THAT
UM YA I FEEL LIKE, I I WAS PRETTY SELFISH FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW
BEING AROUND THESE GUYS REALLY, THERES NO ROOM FOR SELFISHNESS ITS
AWESOME, UM I FEEL LIKE I’M ENJOYING A LOT OF THE FREEDOMS THAT THE
AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE HAS TO OFFER AND IT’S DEFINITELY TIME FOR ME TO
SACRIFICE YOU KNOW FOR LIKE THATS ANOTHER PART OF MOTIVATING ME THATS
YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU LOOK DOWN ON YOURSELF FOR ANYTHING ITS LIKE HEY MAN
YOU’VE ENJOYED A LOT SO YOU KNOW YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS SO DO WHAT YOU
SIGNED UP TO DO UM AND DO IT TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY AND JUST THATS
JUST PRETTY MOTIVATING JUST TO GET THE MOST THAT YOU CAN OUT OF IT AND
THE MOST THAT YOU CAN INTO IT BECAUSE THOSE TWO ARE LIKE DIRECTLY
RELATED THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT AND ITS NOT
LIKE LIKE YOU’RE TAKING AWAY FROM THIS COMMUNITY SELFISHLY IT’S LIKE YOU
ARE JUST BENEFITING AS A YOU ARE BECOMING A BETTER PERSON BY BEING
EVOLVED IN THIS COMMUNITY ITS IT’S JUST PRETTY MOTIVATING LIKE THAT’S
MOTIVATING BUT THAT’S LIKE A ROUND ABOUT RABBIT HOLE ANSWER.

THAT WAS NOT CLICHE, I THINK IT’S GENUINE

OK, COOL

YA, UHH

I DON’T KNOW WHAT CLICHE MEANS

NO UHH YOU SAID ALL OF, YOU HIT ALL OF THE CLICHE BOXES

OK

BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

RIGHT

SORT OF BEING RIGHT AND BELIEVING IT

RIGHT AHH PATRIOTISM

YA

AHH

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S) SO WAS THERE
A HARDEST DAY OR HARDEST EVENT

(LONG PAUSE) HOLISTIC QUESTION, THINK ABOUT YOUR, HOLISTIC QUESTION,
WHAT’D YOU WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
OH UM SO LIKE THINKING OF YOUR ENTIRE BUD/S EXPERIENCE FROM START TO
FINISH WAS THERE A POINT THAT STANDS OUT AS LIKE HARD RIGHT, LIKE

YA UM

WAS THERE WAS THERE A POINT WHERE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT QUITTING WAS
THERE SOMETHING THAT REALLY PUSHED YOU TO THE LIMIT

YOU KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT UM SO THE CS
GAS ON THE ISLAND SUCKED, THAT WAS TERRIBLE

OK

UM THAT LIKE THAT THAT’S JUST TERRIBLE

OK

THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE

OK SO WHAT GOT YOU THROUGH IT, WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET THROUGH THAT

SO WHAT’D YOU YA MEAN YOU’RE IN THIRD PHASE ON THE ISLAND AND YOU
KNOW YOU’RE GONNA TAKE IT, THAT’S JUST THE WAY IT IS, IT’S THERES

THERE’S NO ALTERNATIVE

NO ALTERNATIVE

OKAY AND DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP

100% I ACTUALLY FELT HELD DOWN BY A COUPLE OF MY BUDDIES LIKE JUST
CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GOT YOUR ARMS STUCK TOGETHER

OK

THAT WAS THAT WAS ROUGH UM FRIDAY MORNING, ERR EARLY FRIDAY MORNING
AT LIKE FOUR FIVE A.M. OF HELL WEEK WAS LIKE I WAS COLD I WAS LIKE I WAS

I’M SORRY WHAT DAY OF HELL WEEK WAS IT

FRIDAY

EARLY FRIDAY LIKE FIVE O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING, WHEN THE SUNS ABOUT
TO COME UP BUT IT’S STILL NOT UP, IT’S JUST LIKE YOU’VE BEEN AT IT ALL
WEEK AND I WAS JUST LIKE THERE WAS I WAS JUST QUITTING WASN’T EVEN ON
THE TABLE, IT WAS JUST LIKE JUST WAS YOU’RE LIKE I DON’T KNOW YOUR BODY
JUST, THEY TOLD US TO HIT THE SURF AND I WAS JUST SO INFURIATED BECAUSE
WE’RE ALREADY SO LIKE WHATEVER ANYWAYS YOU HIT THE SURF AND IT’S
FREEZING AND I CAME UP AND I’M LIKE, YOU EVER SEEN THE SCENE IN LIKE
WOLVERINE JUST LIKE GRRRRRR THAT’S HOW I WAS, I WAS JUST PISSED LIKE
THAT SUCKED BUT IT WAS ALSO FUNNY EVERY EVERYTHING IS AWESOME HINDSIGHT,
ONCE IT’S ALL DONE IT’S ALL FUN AND FUNNY AND IT’S GREAT BUT I REMEMBER
LIKE LOOKING AT MY BUDDY AND I’M LIKE ON A BOAT AND HE’S ON A BOAT AND
I’M LOOKING AT HIM AND WE’RE SARCASTICALLY DOING IT BUT WE’RE LIKE
ACTING LIKE CAUSE IT’S FRIDAY OF HELL WEEK YOU KNOW AND NOBODIES GONNA
QUIT

YA

THAT SUCKED

ARE THERE ANY PRACTICES, PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL THAT YOU USE TO
PUSH THROUGH CHALLENGES SO YOU MENTIONED BAPTISM DO YOU PRAY DO YOU
MEDITATE DO YOU HAVE LIKE A STRETCHING ROUTINE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING
PHYSICAL

YA I PRACTICE (UNINTELLIGIBLE) UH VISUALIZATION IS HUGE

OK

VISUALIZATION IF YOU LIKE THAT HELPED ME SO MUCH JUST JUST GOING
THROUGH THE EVENT LIKE WHATEVER WE WERE DOING IN MY BRAIN FIRST AND YOU
KNOW IT ALSO ENSURED THAT YOU ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE
IF YOU ARE LIKE VISUALIZING SOMETHING AND THEN YOU’RE LIKE HEY WHAT’S
THIS LIKE YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS SO YOU CAN STUDY UP ON IT MORE
AND THEN COME BACK VISUALIZE VISUALIZE AND JUST DO RUNS LIKE THAT CAUSE
THERE WAS TIMES ON THE ISLAND WHERE WE WERE DOING RUNS WITH WEAPONS AND
IT’S LIKE I DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE HELL’S GOING ON AND THEN YOU
VISUALIZE VISUALIZE VISUALIZE IT AND YOUR STILL LIKE OH I DON’T KNOW
WHAT’S HAPPENING AND THEN THEIR LIKE GO AND THEN YOU JUST DO EXACTLY
WHAT YOU JUST VISUALIZED, IT’S JUST CRAZY AND PER PER AS WELL FOR SURE

OK

WHENEVER WHENEVER IT’S SOMETHING CAUSE YOU KNOW THOSE TIMES WHERE
YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED 100% AND IT’S LIKE HEY MAN AH YOU KNOW YOU PUT THIS
ON MY HEART TO DO THIS SO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO HAPPEN, THAT’S COOL YOU
KNOW WHATEVER YOUR WILL IS THAT’S GREAT AND HE’S HE’S BEEN SUPER
SUPPORTIVE THE WHOLE TIME

OK

I THINK HE’S REALLY BEEN HELPING A LOT

WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE,
CAN YOU RECALL A MOMENT OF AH MAKING A DECISION THAT WAS TOUGH, I KNOW
YOU DON’T MAKE VERY MANY DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF WHEN YOU’RE IN BUD/S
RIGHT? MOST OF IT’S KIND OF STRUCTURED FOR YOU

RIGHT

BUT CAN YOU RECALL A TIME WHEN YOU HAD TO MAKE A DECISION AND YOU
WHAT YOU ANNN AND WHA WHAT WHAT YOU FELT?

WELL I GUESS WHEN YOU SAID WITH ANY DECISION YOU MAKE YOU’RE
THINKING ABOUT HOW IT’S GONNA RELATE TO ALL THE OTHER GUYS UM HOW IT’S
GONNA AFFECT OTHERS

IS THERE A PARTICULAR UH EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE

YA LIKE IF YOU KNOW YOU’RE TRYING TO, LIKE LET’S SAY YOU’RE GETTIN
BEAT THEY TELL YOU TO SHUTUP DON’T SAY A WORD JUST TAKE OK THAT’S GREAT
BUT IN MY MIND I’M ALWAYS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF I START YELLING LIKE WHAT
HAPPENS IF LIKE INSTEAD OF KEEPING QUIET I’M JUST GONNA START COUNTING
LOUD CAUSE WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO YOU KNOW YOU’RE JUST GETTING THE BOYS
FIRED UP IT MAKES EVERYTHING WAY EASIER AND THEY DON’T LIKE YOU BEING
MOTIVATED AT THE END OF IT THEY JUST BEAT US MORE BUT WE’RE IT’S GONNA
BE EVEN EASIER. SO LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT, I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT UHH
SHOULD I SHOULD I AND THEN I ALWAYS DO, YOU KNOW SO WHATEVER

HAHA, OK, OK

YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT HOW IT LIKE AFFECTS OTHERS, THEN IT’S LIKE
HOPEFULLY THE GUYS UNDERSTAND IF THAT’S NOT WHAT THE INSTRUCTORS
ACTUALLY WANT

OK

HOPEFULLY THEY GET IT BUT

OK, ITS WHAT THEY WANT

WHAT

IT’S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU KNOW

YA OF COURSE

OK

IF THEY DON’T THEN WE GET THE BLAME ANYWAY

WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S RIGHT, AND
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO DIDN’T COMPLETE, LIKE WHAT’S THE
DIFFERENCE, WHAT’D YOU HAVE THAT THEY DIDN’T

UM I’M PRETTY, I’M AVERAGE JOE PHYSICALLY, UM

OK

SO SOMEHOW MY BRAIN LIKES LEARNING NEW STUFF

OK

AND LIKE THAT’S JUST WHAT I LIKE SO

WOULD YOU SAY CURIOUS

YA YA I’D SAY THAT, I GENUINELY ENJOYED TAKING LIKE ON THE NEW STUFF
CAUSE

YA

IT’S LIKE HEY THIS SOMETHING I’VE NEVER DONE, THIS IS THIS SHOULD BE
FASCINATING UM ALSO LIKE HAVING HAVING FAMILY YOU KNOW I CAN CALL FAMILY
ANYTIME, ANYTIME I WAS HAVING TROUBLES JUST TALK TO THEM YOU KNOW TALK
TO TALK TO MY MY GIRLFRIEND WHO IS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY STRONG PERSON

OK

SO TALKING TO MY DAD MY MOM

A STRONG NETWORK OF SUPPORT

ABSOLUTELY AND THEN ALSO ONE THING FOR ME WHICH WAS ALSO I GUESS
I’LL TIE INTO THE WALL IS LIKE YOU KNOW ME LIKE BELIEVING IN GOD
BELIEVING IN LIKE THE GOSPEL AND STUFF, LIKE HAVING THAT NETWORK OF
SUPPORT, I MEAN IT’S AMAZING TO GET THE PEOPLE THAT COME THROUGH HERE

YA

THAT THAT DON’T HAVE THAT FAITH, IT’S LIKE YOU ARE A VERY VERY VERY
STRONG PERSON YOU KNOW IT’S IT’S I NOBODY’S RIGHT OR WRONG I DON’T YOU
KNOW IT’S BELIEVE IN WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE IN IS FINE IT’S JUST LIKE WOW
YOU YOUR THE STRONGEST I I HAVE TO I HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW
IT’S JUST THE WAY THAT MY BRAIN WORKS AND WHAT I BELIEVE SO I DON’T KNOW

OK SO FOR THOSE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS THEIR, DID
YOU RECOGNIZE ANYTHING A TREND FOR PEOPLE WHO DROPPED OR WERE DROPPED?

YA PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERLY SELFISH AND UH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
PHYSICALLY READY

OK

AND UM

SO YOU CAN GET THROUGH IF YOU ARE PHYSICALLY AVERAGE BUT IF YOUR YOU
DON’T MEET THAT STANDARD THAT MINIMUM STANDARD

YA YA I MEAN THAT THERE IS A STANDARD I NEVER I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
MEETING THE STANDARD UM IT’S YOU KNOW SOME STUFF I DID WELL REALLY WELL
AT PHYSICALLY SOME STUFF WAS A LITTLE BIT HARDER BUT STILL YOU GOTTA
MEET THE STANDARD UM BUT YA THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONAL ATHLETES HERE,
THAT’S WHY I AM AVERAGE

OK

UM

ANYTHING ELSE FOR OTHERS THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT SO IF WE WERE TO PUT IN
A SCREENING TOOL SAY

YOU KNOW THEY THEY SOME GUYS COME IN AND AN THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF IT
BUT THEY NEVER NEVER HAVE ANY INTENTION OF COMPLETING IT FOR LIKE
ACTUALLY COMPLETING IT, IT’S SUPER WEIRD YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME LIKE
THIS GUY HAS NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS AND HE JUST WANTED A TASTE, IT’S JUST
SUPER STRANGE

OK, UM SO LIKE A DISTORTED IDEA OF THE REALITY OF IT

YA AND ALSO I I WAS VERY VERY FORTUNATE THATS I WAS SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE I WAS SUPER FORTUNATE THAT I DIDN’T HAVE INJURIES, SOME PEOPLE
HAD INJURIES AND LIKE THAT CAN REALLY TIE INTO THEIR DECISION MAKING
WITH YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT DIFFERENT EVOLUTION ARE SO I WAS SUPER SUPER
FORTUNATE

SO YOUR HEALTH

YES

AND OTHER SO WHEN YOU SAY FORTUNATE I THINK LUCK, DO DO YOU WANT TO
SAY THAT YOUR LUCKY OR

I MEAN I I WOULDN’T SAY THAT, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE ALL THE GUYS MADE
IT GREAT LIKE ALL THE GUYS, IT IT WAS JUST GOOD YA A GOOD SITUATION
GREAT SITUATION, I HAD A GREAT CLASS

OK

AND THAT THAT WAS WAS REALLY FORTUNATE YOU KNOW CAUSE SOME CLASSES
SUCK AND IT MAKES EVERYTHING A LOT HARDER

YA OK SO MAYBE UH OK SO HOW DID THIS SO FIRST, DID THIS EXPERIENCE
CHANGE YOU, GOING THROUGH BUD/S AND IF SO HOW?

IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED A LOT OF FLAWS THAT I YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT
LIKE THE TOWN I GREW UP IN I WAS SURROUNDED WITH PEOPLE I HAD KNOWN MY
ENTIRE LIFE SO YOU ARE NOT REALLY GONNA GET ANY NEW FEEDBACK LIKE
THEY’LL JUST ACCEPT YOU FOR THE WAY YOU ARE LIKE HERE IF THERE’S
SOMETHING THAT THAT THERE’S A CHARACTER TRAIT THAT YOU HAVE UM THAT’S
GONNA BE ADVERSE TO THE TEAM, THEIR GONNA LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SO YOU
CAN FIX IT

SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’VE GROWN

100% IN INTO SOMETHING THAT WILL BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR ME AND I
HAVE A LOT OF GROWING TO DO A TON OF GROWING TO DO, LEFT JUST LIKE

SO EVEN JUST AWARENESS THAT YOU NEED TO

ABSOLUTELY AWARENESS, AWARENESS THAT’S A GREAT WORD

HUGE UMM THIS IS THE FIRST STEP RIGHT

YES

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I DIDN’T COVER IN THE SURVEY THAT YOU THINK
THAT WE SHOULD ASK OR THAT YOU WANT TO TELL US UM CAUSE WE REALLY ARE
INTERESTED IN WHAT GETS SOMEBODY THROUGH

REALLY

YEP

HOW THE HECK CAN YOU QUANTIFY GRIT AND RESILIENCEY, HOW HOW CAN YOU
DO THAT

I’M HAPPY TO GIVE YOU SOME OF OUR UH UH BACKGROUND BEHIND IT, IS
THERE ANYTHING FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE FROM THIS THAT WE’RE NOT ASKING OR
IS THERE A TRAIT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU BROUGHT TO THE TABLE THAT, IF NOT
I CAN WE CAN CUT IT AND WE CAN

I’M OK

OK COOL

 OK, HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE

 UH TWO

 AND WHAT IS THE BIRTH ORDER

 UM I’M MY BROTHERS THE OLDEST, HES 30, I’M 29, I’M THE MIDDLE AND
MY LITTLE SISTERS 25

 OK IF YOU THINK OF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES WHAT MIGHT YOU DESCRIBE AS
YOUR CRUCIBLE OR LIFE SHAPING EXPERIENCES

 UM BESIDES BUDS

 YES

 UM YA I THINK BUDS BUDS IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST ONE

 OK

 I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT WILL UH BE EVERYONE'S ANSWER ON THAT
QUESTION

 BEFORE S

 BEFORE THAT

 CHILDHOOD TEENAGE

 OH THAT’S A GOOD QUESTION

 COLLEGE

 YA I MEAN COLLEGE I’M THINKING IF ANYTHING STOOD OUT AS
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT UM OVERALL KINDA PATTERNS CARRIED OUT I
WOULDN’T SAY THERE WAS ANY SORT OF

 HARDSHIP

 HARDSHIP GROWING UP THAT I HAD TO DO UM I DID GET MY PILOT’S
LICENSE UM THAT WAS PRETTY DIFFICULT

 YA

 SO THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THEM BUT THERE WAS NO GROWING UP
FAMILY HARDSHIP

 OK HOW DID GETTING YOUR PILOT'S LICENSE OR GOING THROUGH COLLEGE
FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCES GOING THROUGH BUDS

 UH PROBABLY THE SAME LESSONS YOU GET UM WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE OR
GETTING YOUR LICENSE IT’S APPLICABLE TO BUDS UM YOU LEARN ATTENTION TO
DETAIL UM YOU KNOW YOU LEARN TO BOTH THOSE BOTH COLLEGE AND PILOTS
LICENSE ARE JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU ACHIEVE OVERNIGHT SO IT IS PROBABLY
YOU GET OUT OF SURVEYS YOU ARE WORKING FOR A GOAL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF
TIME AND YOU CAN'T REALLY GIVE UP HALFWAY THROUGH THAT GOAL SIMILAR TO
BUDS SO YOU KINDA MAKE THE DECISION TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU FOLLOW
THROUGH IT UM SO YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY LEARNED A LITTLE BIT OF THAT UM
I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT OF THAT UM JUST GENTLY FROM WRITTEN TYPE STUFF
FROM HAVING TO ACHIEVE THOSE LONG TERM GOALS NOT JUST AN OVERNIGHT AN
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS

 RIGHT AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
PROGRESSION THROUGH BUDS

 I DON'T THINK MY PERSONALITY CHANGED I THINK I WAS THE SAME GUY
PERSONALITY WISE NOW

 YA SO TO CLARIFY, NOT HOW YOUR PERSONALITY CHANGED BUT HOW YOUR
PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR SUCCESS AT BUDS

 SURE SURE WELL I THINK A BIG IS JUST MY IM PRETTY LIGHT HEARTED
LIKE I I WAS LAUGHING FOR 95% OF BUDS EVEN WHEN IT SUCKED AND THAT'S
KINDA THE SAME WAY I'VE BEEN IN LIFE BUT LIKE KEEPING A SENSE OF HUMOR
WITH EVERYTHING YOUR GOING THROUGH EVERYONES IN THE SAME SITUATION

 YA

 WE’RE ALL MISERABLE TOGETHER SO THERES SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT
UMM I THINK VE ALWAYS BE JUST NOT I IT WOULDN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME IF I
QUIT UM EVERYTHING I'VE DONE I DID IN LIFE I’VE JUST WHETHER IT’S MY
OWN I DON’T WANT TO USE THE WORD EGO CAUSE THAT'S A NEGATIVE
CONNOTATION BUT FOR MYSELF YOU KNOW I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT
THROUGH THIS AND DID IT UMM DID NEVER GIVE UP

 OKAY NOT TO PUT WORDS INTO YOUR MOUTH BUT WOULD YOU SAY PRIDE?

 I WOULD SAY PRIDE

 YA

 YA I MORE PRIDE LESS LESS EGO I WOULD

 YA

 CAUSE EGO IS A BAD CONNOTATION AROUND HERE BUT UMM BUT YA MY OWN
SELF PRIDE AND SELF SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT

 OKAY DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO BECOME PART OF THE
SEAL COMMUNITY

 HMM MUM

 UM SO YOU COULD TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD

 MM YA SURE SO I I KINDA BOUNCED AROUND GROWING UP I LIVED IN A
BUNCH OF PLACES UMM I BORN IN ARIZONA THEN MOVED TO NEW JERSEY THEN
SALT LAKE CITY UTAH UMM

 WERE YOU FROM A MILITARY FAMILY

 I WAS NOT BUT MY DADS JOB MOVED AROUND QUITE A BIT

 OKAY

 SO WE MOVED AROUND QUITE A BIT AND THEN UMM ONE OF OUR THE ONE
PLACE THAT WAS CONSISTENT WAS CORONADO, WE HAVE A SUMMER HOUSE HERE,
STILL DO

 OKAY

 SO I’VE BEEN COMING TO CORONADO SINCE I WAS YOU KNOW ONE YEARS
OLD TWO YEARS OLD WHATEVER IT WAS SO EVEN THOUGH LIKE THIS HAS ALWAYS
FELT LIKE HOME TO ME

 OK

 I LEARNED ABOUT THE TEAMS EARLY WHEN I WAS YOUNG UMM IT WAS
SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BUT I NEVER REALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER
ON IT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I ENLISTED IN THE NAVY AT 29, 28

 OK

 SO IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO GET HERE

 YEP

 UMM BUT

 BUT THAT SEED WAS PLANTED YOUNG

 YA ID SAY SO AND THEN I WENT TO COLLEGE GOT OUT OF COLLEGE AND
STARTED WORKING SOME DESK JOBS UHH AND JUST FELT OVERALL UNSATISFIED
WITH WHAT I WAS DOING AND ID FIND EVERYDAY I'D BE ON YOUTUBE FINDING
VIDEOS ON SEAL TEAMS LEARNING EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT THE TEAMS SO
ONE DAY I SAID SCREW IT WHY AM I WASTING ALL THIS TIME WATCHING VIDEOS
WHY DONT WHY DON'T I UHH ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH MY DREAMS SO
KINDA QUIT EVERYTHING AND RAN OFF TO JOIN THE CIRCUS

 GREAT SO IF YOU COULD TELL ME GOING BACK TO CHILDHOOD UHH ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS YOUR FAMILIES PARENTING STYLE

 YA

 SO SPECIFICALLY WE ARE INTERESTED IN DISCIPLINE SO SPANKING VERSUS
TIMEOUT VERSUS WITHHOLDING TOYS OR VIDEO GAMES

 YA THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION MY PARENTS WERE STRICT THEY WEREN'T
LIKE BEAT ME STRICT IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS GETTING THE BELT OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BUT

 OK WAS THERE ANY CORPORAL PUNISHMENT SPANKING OR

 UHH NO

 RESTRAINT OR

 NO MAYBE LIKE NO MAYBE LIKE ONCE IN MY LIFE THEY WERE THEY WERE
GENTLE GENTLER GENTLER PUNISHERS I GUESS BUT THEY WERE DEFINITELY MORE
ON THE STRICT SIDE

 SO CURFEWS

 CURFEWS NO OBVIOUSLY NO DRINKING LIKE THAT GROWING UP

 OKAY

 THEY WERE VERY GOOD PARENTS YOU KNOW I’D HAD TO HAVE GOOD GRADES
IN SCHOOL GET INTO A GOOD COLLEGE DO ALL THAT

 OK AND THEN IN TEENAGE YEARS UHH YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR MOVING
AROUND DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A TEAM ACTIVITY OR A SPORT

 YA

 THAT WOULD HAVE A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY

 YA I I THINK ANY SPORTS TEAM THAT IS A TEAM SPORT HAS A TIGHT
KNIT COMMUNITY

 SO DID YOU PLAY ANY

 I PLAYED BASKETBALL UHH IN HIGH SCHOOL

 OKAY

 I PLAYED VOLLEYBALL AS WELL WHICH IN CALIFORNIA IS KINDA LAW I
WENT TO SCHOOL IN ARIZONA

 YA

 AND I ENDED UP PLAYING COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL AT USC IN LOS ANGELES

 SO HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE

 YEP FOR VOLLEYBALL

 WAS THAT D1

 YA THAT WAS D1 WE WERE NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR TWO YEARS

 THAT'S GREAT, CONGRATS

 I NEVER PLAYED I WAS A WALKON

 OKAY

 SO THAT PROBABLY HELPED A LOT TOO ACTUALLY LOOKING AT IT NOW JUST
CAUSE I HAD TO BE THE ONE FIRST ONE IN THE GYM LAST ONE TO LEAVE JUST
TO PROVE THAT I BELONGED ON THAT TEAM

 YA

 CAUSE THERE WAS MUCH BETTER TALENT THAT THEY HAD ON THE TEAM SO
THE ONE THING I COULD REALLY OFFER WAS HARD WORK AND A GOOD ATTITUDE
ABOUT IT

 YA OK GREAT, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS

 UHHH I I WOULD SAY JUST TRYING TO BETTER THAN THE PERSON I WAS
YESTERDAY I THINK I THINK UMM I THINK LIFES IN CONSTANT QUEST TO GET
BETTER AND IF I PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY I NEED TO MAKE SURE I DO
SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME BETTER THAN THE HUMAN I WAS YESTERDAY

 OK GREAT WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF BUD/S

 UM

 IT'S A HOLISTIC QUESTION THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY

 HARDEST DAY

 OR THE MOMENT WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT

 YAA

 UNINTELLIGIBLE

 MONDAY OF HELL WEEK

 MONDAY

 ABOUT 24 HOURS INTO HELL WEEK I WAS HAVING A PRETTY ROUGH GO I
WAS TIRED COLD AND HUNGRY I HADN’T QUITE GOT INTO THAT LIZARD BRAIN
STATE YET AND ONE OF MY BEST BUDDIES WHO ID SPENT THE LAST FOUR MONTHS
WITH I KNEW HIS FAMILY HIS GIRLFRIEND HE QUIT UHH THAT KINDA ROCKED ME
A LITTLE BIT UHH BUT THEN I REMEMBER WE DID A VERY SPECIFIC EVOLUTION
CALLED UHH BASE TOUR IT'S THIS SAVAGE LIKE LONG RUN WITH BOATS ON HEAD
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS OF BUDS. THAT ACTUALLY KINDA KICK
STARTED ME INTO FEELING I WAS DOWN IN THE DUMPS AND WE DID THAT
EVOLUTION AND I WAS LIKE HELL YEA LIKE THIS IS EXACTLY I DESERVE TO BE
HERE I BELONG HERE AND FOR THE REST OF HELL WEEK I KNEW I WAS GONNA
GET THROUGH IT, IT WAS JUST THAT ONE ONE CRAZY EVOLUTION THAT GOT ME
THROUGH THAT

 YA

 THAT PAIN AND THAT SUFFERING PUSHED ME INTO THAT PRIMAL STATE

 YA

 AND I WAS PUMPED ABOUT IT

 YA COOL UHH OKAY SO IS THAT;S ACTUALLY MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT
MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH SO YOU HIT PRIMAL

 YA

 AND THEN DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP

 I FELT LIKE IT WAS A JOURNEY THAT WE WERE ALL IN TOGETHER BUT AT
THE SAME TIME IT’S YOUR OWN PATH, THE HELL WEEK BATTLE IT'S IT’S A BIG
INTERNAL BATTLE WITH YOURSELF AS WELL. YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO RELY ON
THE SUPPORT OF THE GUYS AROUND YOU BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
INSIDE OF YOU THAT GETS THROUGH IT, YOU CONTROL YOUR FATE. I COULD'VE
CHOSEN ANYTIME TO QUIT OR I COULD'VE CHOSEN ANYTIME TO PUSH THROUGH
IT. YOU GOTTA CHOSE IT

 WHAT PRACTICES PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL DID YOU UTILIZE TO GET
THROUGH THE CHALLENGE, DO YOU PRAY MEDITATE DO YOU

 HONESTLY I DON’T DO MUCH OF THAT STUFF

 OK

 WE LEARNED A BUNCH OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS TECHNIQUES UHH FOR HELL
WEEK BUT I THINK UMM YA I MEAN THERE WAS A VISUALIZATION AND I USED A
LOT OF THAT FOR MORE TECHNICAL SKILL TYPE STUFF FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD
THIS STUFF IN PHASE TWO CALLED OC8. IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL TEST. I DID
A LOT OF VISUALIZATION AT HOME TO GET THE PROCEDURES DOWN RIGHT. BUT
AS FAR AS MENTAL TOUGHNESS YOU JUST KINDA ITS HARD TO PUT A FINGER ON
IT I JUST DIDN’T QUIT

 WOULD YOU CALL THIS CHAIR FLYING …. UNIT.

 YEA ITS LIKE CHAIR FLYING YOU KNOW THE WHOLE GOING TO YOUR HAPPY
PLACE AND STUFF LIKE THAT DIDN’T WORK FOR ME ID GO TO MY HAPPY PLACE
AND GET HIT BY A WAVE

 HAHA SURE

 AND GET KNOCKED OUT OF IT, IT DIDN’T DO MUCH

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING DURING AT BUDS,
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION AND CAN YOU
PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE, SO WERE YOU EVER IN A TOUGH PLACE WHERE YOU HAD TO
MAKE SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU AND YOU HAD THE AUTONOMY TO

 YA THE THING ABOUT BUD/S IS YOU DON’T HAVE A LOT OF AUTONOMY,
EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE IS PRETTY MUCH MADE FOR YOU ESPECIALLY
THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW FIRST PHASE DEFINITELY, SECOND PHASE THIRD PHASE A
LITTLE MORE AUTONOMY. I WOULD SAY LIKE A DIFFICULT DECISION IF YOU CAN
GO BACK TO HELL WEEK THAT MONDAY NIGHT IT WAS THE DECISION OF DO I
STAY DOING THIS BEING IN PAIN HURT AND TIRED THEN YOU KNOW FOR THE
FIRST AND ONLY TIME IN TRAINING THAT I HAD A SECOND WEIGHED OPTIONS
YOU KNOW I WAS LIKE SHIT IF I QUIT WHAT DO I TELL MY FAMILY AND THOSE
THOUGHTS HAD NEVER CROSSED MY MIND IN THIS PIPELINE AND IT WAS ONLY
TEN MINUTES AND I WAS I WAS CHALLENGED AND YOU KNOW YOU MAKE THE
DECISION THEN AND THERE I’M NOT GONNA LET THIS DECISION GET IN MY WAY
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA POWER THROUGH IT, THAT WAS REALLY THE ONLY DECISION
YOU MAKE AT BUD/S. YA I MEAN THERE IS SIMPLE LIKE YOU KNOW DO I GO TO
SAFETY ON A PIER BUT JUST BASIC DAY TO DAY DECISION BUT NOT LIKE BIG
LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS THAT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THEM

 YA GREAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN ASSISTED BY
INFINITE MOMENTS BUT YOU DIDN’T REALIZE OR DIDN’T RECOGNIZE IT WAS A
DECISION UNTIL THEN

 YA I MEAN YOU ALWAYS KNOW ITS IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD BUT IT WAS
A FULL FRONTAL HEAD ON COLLISION THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE THIS DECISION
RIGHT NOW KINDA THING

 OKAY SO THIS IS GONNA SOUND LIKE ANOTHER GENERAL QUESTION BUT WHY
DID YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUDS AND DID YOU
NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT RIGHT SO
LIKE WHY YOU

 YA WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ALOT WITH THE GUYS AROUND HERE AND OUR
FAMILIES SO I THINK ITS GONNA SOUND LIKE A TERRIBLE ANSWER BUT I THINK
A MASSIVE PART OF IT IS SELF DELUSION LIKE TRICKING YOURSELF INTO
THINKING YOU CAN DO ANYTHING

 THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO FAIL

 WHY PEOPLE NO NO NO WHY PEOPLE SUCCEED

 OHH

 RIGHT SO MY THEORY IS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE SO GOOD AT EVERYTHING
THROUGH THIS PIPELINE THAT YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO RUN BOATS FOR MILES ON
END THEN YOU GOTTA BE SMART ENOUGH TO DO DIVING STUFF AND THEN SAFE
ENOUGH TO DO GUN STUFF AND NO HUMAN SHOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO BE THAT
GOOD AT EVERY SINGLE FACET OF TRAINING RIGHT YOUR GONNA KINDA ROAD
BLOCK AT SOME POINT DURING TRAINING BUT IF YOU CAN TRICK YOURSELF INTO
TRAINING LIKE SCREW IT I CAN DIVING I CAN DO GUN STUFF I CAN DO FIRST
PHASE AND HELL WEEK AND YOU JUST TELLING YOURSELF THAT ABSOLUTELY LIKE
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND I'M GETTING THROUGH THIS EVEN IF SOMEWHERE ELSE
STATISTICS ARE AGAINST YOU AND IT'S GONNA SUCH AND YOU’RE GONNA GET
THROUGH IT BUT IF YOU CAN TRICK YOURSELF INTO SAYING YA I CAN DO THIS
YOU CAN DO IT, IT’S THAT OLD QUOTE OF THOSE WHO THINK THEY CAN AND
THOSE WHO THINK THEY CAN’T ARE IN BOTH RIGHT IT’S TRUE, BELIEVING IN
YOURSELF AND MAKING SURE YOURSELF OF MAKING THAT DECISION. DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE I KNOW ITS KINDA A WEIRD ANSWER

 NO IT DOES SO WE’RE TALKING ABOUT CONFIDENCE ABOUT UHH

 YA ITS CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF BUT AGAIN THE WHOLE LIKE ITS SELF
CONFIDENCE BUT A SMART PERSON SHOULD REALIZE THAT THAT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN GET THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF AND LEARN WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN
JUST IF YOU CAN TRICK YOURSELF INTO THINKING YOU CAN IT TENDS TO WORK
OUT I DON’T KNOW THAT WAS MY PROBLEM BUT PROBABLY NOT THE MOST UHH
POLITICAL ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW

 NO

 TRICKING MYSELF INTO THINKING THIS FROM THE BEGINNING INTO
GETTING THROUGH IT IS PROBABLY HOW I DID IT

 NO ITS NOT THE BEST BUT YOU DID IT PERSONALLY AND WE’RE LOOKING FOR
THOSE RAW REAL ANSWERS. SO WAS THERE WHAT WOULD PEOPLE DO THAT FAILED
OUT

 YA I THINK BAD ATTITUDES I THINK THEY WHEN THERE WAS PAIN AND
SUFFERING AND MAKING JOKES THEY WERE RELYING ON OTHER GUYS TO PICK
THEM UP I THINK THEY JUST LET THAT CONSUME THEM AND GOT BAD ATTITUDES
ABOUT I THINK UM OVERALL PHYSICAL FITNESS HAS A BIG PART IN IT YOU
KNOW I THINK THERE'S DUDES THAT JUST YA I ITS PHYSICAL FITNESS DOES
PLAY A ROLE IN IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU STILL HAVE TO CARRY A
BOAT A LONG WAY. SO YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO SOME LEVEL OF STRENGTH IN
ORDER TO DO THAT

 SO IT STARTS AT A LOW LEVEL

 YA THEY REALLY WEREN’T AS PHYSICALLY STRONG AS SOME GUYS

 OKAY

 IT'S TOUGH TRAINING YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO BE PHYSICALLY STRONG

 YA

 AND THE OTHER ONE IS ATTITUDE IS NOT UHH PHYSICAL MENTAL AND THEN
I JUST IT WAS UHH ….UNINTELLIGIBLE…..YA I CAN’T EXPRESS WHAT EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS I THINK ATTITUDE IS A BIG THING LIKE YOU CHOOSE IF YOU MAKE
IT THROUGH THE PROGRAM OR NOT LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON’T MAKE IT
THROUGH OR HAVE EXCUSES THEY THEIR HURT OR INJURED OR THE DAY IT WAS
COLD THAT DAY SO THAT'S WHY I DIDN’T RUN AS FAST THEY THROW OUT
BULLSHIT IN MY OPINION LIKE YOU ARE THE ONE THAT DECIDES IF YOU GET
THROUGH OR NOT AND YOU GUYS EVEN HIT ON IT IN YOUR SURVEYS THERE'S
LIKE 11 12 QUESTIONS IF I SEE A ROADBLOCK IN MY WAY WHO HAS CONTROL OF
THAT AND THE ANSWER FOR MOST THE GUYS HERE IS I HAVE CONTROL THE
EXAMPLE I USE IS IT STARTS ON THAT 20 PERCENT THAT MAKE IT THROUGH
TRAINING OR WHATEVER IT IS AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE OH THAT'S TERRIBLE HOW
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH ITS 20 PERCENT THE ODDS AREN'T 20% IT'S
NOT LIKE I GOT A FIVE SIDED COIN AND I GET LUCKY YOU LITERALLY CONTROL
WHETHER YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THIS OR NOT SO IN MY MIND YOU HAVE A 100
PERCENT CHANCE OF GETTING THROUGH CAUSE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DECIDES
THEY DON'T DECIDE FOR YOU. IF YOU PERFORM AND YOU DO WHAT THEY SAY AND
YOU JUST GET THROUGH IT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH AND ITS AS SIMPLE
AS THAT

 SO UMM

 BONUS QUESTION, EXTRA CREDIT WHAT IS THIS

 UM HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON, ARE YOU CHANGED
IS WHAT I SHOULD SO HOW

 YA I'M MORE PROUD OF THE GUY I AM NOW THAN WHEN I STARTED I WOULD
SAY I WOULDN’T SAY IT MADE ME TOUGHER I WOULDN’T SAY ANYTHING LIKE
THAT I FEEL LIKE IT BROUGHT OUT QUALITIES I HAD AND GAVE ME A CHANCE
TO TEST THOSE QUALITIES SENSE OF HUMOR STAYED THE SAME YOU KNOW AND
I’M JUST HAPPY, IM GENERALLY A HAPPY GUY I DON’T GET PISSED OFF A LOT
I’M JUST HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND MAKE SOME FRIENDS UHH DO SOME
REALLY COOL JOB

 DOES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TEST YOURSELF IMPROVE YOUR CONFIDENCE, DO
YOU THINK YOUR CONFIDENCE HAS GONE UP?

 UHH IT’S GOOD TO CONFIRM OBVIOUS LIKE YOU KNOW, IT’S GOOD TO
CONFIRM IT WOULD SAVE TIME I JUST I DON’T KNOW YA IT HELPED WITH
CONFIDENCE I GUESS BUT I KINDA I FELT LIKE I WAS TRYING TO GET THROUGH
THE TRAINING BEFORE I CAME IN HERE

 OKAY

 I DIDN’T COME IN SAYING OH I MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE I CAME IN
KNOWING I WAS GOING TO GET THROUGH WHETHER THAT WAS SELF DELUSION OR
WHAT IT WORKS

 ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD?

 NO THAT'S IT

 (SIO): WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S
  CLASS? IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE?

YES, SO I JOINED THE NAVY A WHILE AGO. BUT IT’S MY FIRST BUD/S CLASS 3…
I WAS ACTUALLY 338. BUT ITS MY FIRST TIME GOING THROUGH BUD/S YES.

 HOW MANY SIBLINGS DID YOU HAVE? WERE THEY OLDER, YOUNGER,
  GIRLS, BOYS?

I HAVE 2 SIBLINGS.

 ARE YOU THE OLDEST, THE YOUNGEST, CAN YOU GIVE ME BIRTH ORDER?

I’M IN THE MIDDLE. SO I HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER AND A YOUNGER SISTER.

 AND THEN CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DYNAMICS? ARE YOUR
  PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

YEAH SO I HAVE A REALLY CLOSE FAMILY. MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR
25 YEARS. GREW UP PRETTY MUCH SPENDING MY ENTIRE LIFE WITH MY FAMILY. I
THINK BEFORE I JOINED THE NAVY THE LONGEST WE’D BEEN APART WAS MAYBE A
WEEK. I JOINED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL SO.

 AND DO YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM?

YES! I TALK TO THEM ALMOST EVERY DAY, MAYBE A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK. THEY
LIVE CLOSE, AN HOUR, SO I SEE THEM ALL THE TIME TOO.

 ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DYNAMICS THAT YOU THINK WOULD
  BE RELEVANT TO WHAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF…

UMMM I GREW UP IN A PRETTY STABLE HOUSE HOLD. MY PARENTS MAKE GOOD
MONEY. SELF-EMPLOYED. UM. PRETTY MUCH WAS ABLE TO, NOT DO WHATEVER I
WANTED, BUT IF I REALLY WANTED TO GO DO SOMETHING MY PARENTS WERE
USUALLY ABLE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN SO I’M PRETTY FORTUNATE IN THAT WAY.
NEVER REALLY STRUGGLED FOR ANYTHING. UM. SO I THINK THAT’S INTERESTING
BECAUSE THERE’S ALSO PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD POLAR OPPOSITE EXPERIENCES IN
THIS COMMUNITY SO… YEAH.

 SO WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAVE HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR
  TO BUD/S?

OH OKAY! SO, THE BIGGEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE IS… I
ORIGINALLY ENLISTED IN THE NAVY, AND THEN I GOT PICKED UP FOR AN OFFICER
COMMISSIONING PROGRAM THROUGH SEAMAN TO ADMIRAL. UM AND IN MY LAST YEAR
OF STA-21 I ACTUALLY GOT ARRESTED FOR RUNNING FROM THE POLICE AND I LOST
MY COMMISSIONING, I LOST MY RATE, AND I WAS SENT TO THE FLEET WHICH
SPARKED MY ABILITY TO COME HERE.

 UHHH DO YOU WANT TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT INCIDENT?

UHH YEAH. I JOINED THE NAVY. I ENLISTED AS A NUKE. I WENT THROUGH NUKE
SCHOOL. AND I GOT PICKED UP SEAMAN TO ADMIRAL AS A NUKE, UMM… I WAS IN
ROTC AT UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. UHH I DID VERY WELL. UMM. I WAS SLOTTED
TO BE A NUCLEAR OFFICER. AND THEN I GOT INTO RIDING MOTORCYCLES. RODE
WITH SOME OF MY GOOD BUDDIES AND STUFF THERE. AND UH WE JUST KINDA SPENT
DAY TO DAY RIDING KINDA OBLIVIOUS TO THE LAW. WE KINDA DID WHATEVER,
WE’D SPEED WHEREVER, AND ONE DAY WE WERE OUT RIDING AND WE MADE AN
ILLEGAL PASS. UMM WE UHH, THIS POLICE OFFICER HAPPENED TO SEE US. HE
TURNED HIS LIGHTS ON BEHIND US AND WE JUST DECIDED WE WEREN’T GONNA PULL
OVER. WE WERE JUST GONNA LEAVE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE’D GET AWAY. UMM
LONG STORY SHORT I END UP GETTING AWAY, BUT MY BUDDY DIDN’T. THEY TOOK
HIS GOPRO AND THEN I GOT ARRESTED TWO WEEKS LATER. AND WENT TO ALL THE
COURT HEARINGS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. AND ENDED UP GETTING DROPPED
FROM STA-21. UHH, KICKED OUT OF THE PROGRAM, THEY TOOK MY COMMISSIONING,
UHHH TRIED TO SEND ME BACK AS A NUKE AND THEN UH I HAD SOME PAPERWORK
GET MESSED UP BY PSD AND I LOST MY SECURITY CLEARANCE. SO THEY SENT ME
TO THE FLEET AS A DC MAN. AND THEN AS SOON AS I GOT TO THE FLEET I
FIGURED THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE IN THE NAVY I WAS GONNA DO BESIDES COME
HERE SO HERE I AM.

 SO HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT
  BUD/S?

UMMM I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I LEARNED WAS… SO I SPENT A LONG TIME WHY
I MADE THE DECISIONS I MADE LIKE WHY I DID THAT. BECAUSE LITERALLY I’D
NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND THEN LIKE, I HAD SO MUCH TO
LOSE BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT I DIDN’T THINK ABOUT THE THINGS I HAD
TO LOSE, I DIDN’T THINK ABOUT THE REST OF MY LIFE, IN THAT MOMENT I JUST
AUTOMATICALLY MADE A DECISION. I WAS LIKE I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHY I DID
THAT. AND WHAT I FIGURED OUT WAS THAT THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE ON A DAILY
BASIS, LIKE LITTLE TINY DECISIONS KIND OF TRAIN YOU TO MAKE DECISIONS IN
THE MOMENT. SO LIKE THE TEAMS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW YOU FALL BACK ON
TRAINING, AND I FOUND THAT 100% IN REAL LIFE THOUGH. SO I REALIZED THAT
IN THAT SPLIT SECOND I WAS LIKE, “HEY DO I PULL OVER OR HEY DO I RUN?”
BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY SPENT WEEKS MAKING POOR DECISIONS AGAINST THE LAW
SO I HAD ALREADY MADE THAT DECISION BEFORE IT CAME UP. UM AND I FOUND
THAT SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES HERE. BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE THAT QUIT, A LOT
OF THE TIMES ITS NOT, THE PEOPLE DON’T THINK ABOUT THE REST OF THEIR
LIVES THEY DON’T THINK ABOUT LIKE “HEY, HOW IS ME QUITTING RIGHT NOW
GOING TO AFFECT ME DOWN THE ROAD?” A LOT OF TIMES ITS AN IN THE MOMENT
DECISION. AS MUCH AS THEY’VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT OR WHATEVER BUT I
THINK THAT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE QUIT ITS AN IN THE MOMENT
DECISION. I THINK THAT COMES DOWN TO LIKE… HOW HAVE YOU TRAINED YOURSELF
IN THE YEARS BEFORE? HOW HAVE YOU TRAINED YOURSELF YOUR WHOLE LIFE? DO
YOU MAKE THOSE SMALL DECISIONS? DO YOU GIVE UP ON LITTLE THINGS
THROUGHOUT? HAVE YOU EVER SPENT TIME COMPLETELY DEDICATED TO SOMETHING
AND TRAINING YOURSELF TO HAVE THAT DEDICATION? AND I THINK THOSE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE, WHEN THEY GET HERE, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE MOMENTS WHERE
YOU’RE LIKE I DON’T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE, YOU’VE ALREADY TRAINED
YOURSELF THAT IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU WANT. YOU’RE GOING TO STAY
DEDICATED TO WHATEVER YOU’RE DOING. I THINK THAT’S LIKE, WHAT I’VE
NOTICED FROM… IT’S HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT EXPERIENCE FROM MY LIFE AND I
THEN I SAW IT WHEN I GOT HERE. AND I THINK THAT, IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
DEFINING FACTORS IN MY OPINION OF WHAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO MOVE ON.

 SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CONSCIOUSLY TO THEN TRAIN YOURSELF WITH
  THOSE SMALL DECISIONS?

OKAY, SO I THINK FOR ME THE BIGGEST THING THAT GOT ME THROUGH HERE WAS
THAT I SPENT ABOUT 3 OR 4 YEARS DOING BODYBUILDING AND STUFF. AND
THROUGH THAT PRACTICE, YOU HAVE TO BE 100 PERCENT DEDICATED, SO LIKE
EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN YOU’RE LIKE HEY I WANT TO EAT THIS YOU HAVE TO
LIKE MAKE THAT CONSCIOUS EFFORT NOT TO. AND THEN IT BECOMES KIND OF LIKE
SECOND NATURE. IF YOU’VE EVER BEEN ON A DIET YOU KIND OF NOTICE THAT ITS
HARD AT THE BEGINNING BUT THEN YOU LIKE FALL INTO THE TRACK AND ITS EASY
TO MAKE THOSE GOOD DECISIONS. SO I THINK HAVING THAT ABILITY TO
DISCIPLINE MYSELF IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS FOR THAT. UHH AND THEN
WHEN I WAS TRAINING TO COME HERE I DID THE SAME THING WITH MY TRAINING.
I WOULD BE LIKE OH ITS RAINING OUTSIDE AND ITS COLD, I DON’T WANT TO GO
OUTSIDE AND TRAIN. BUT LIKE NO, THESE ARE THOSE LITTLE DECISIONS THAT
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE LATER ON. SO DURING MY TRAINING I’D BE LIKE IF I
DIDN’T WANT TO I WOULD PUSH MYSELF AND BE LIKE, “HEY I NEED TO MAKE THIS
LITTLE DECISION IF I WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL LATER.” SO I MAKE THAT
DECISION AND THEN YA KNOW, IT TRANSLATES HERE. LIKE TO BE HONEST I NEVER
EVEN CONSIDERED QUITTING. IT WAS JUST KINDA LIKE… WHEN THINGS GOT REALLY
BAD MY MIND DIDN’T EVEN WANDER IN THAT DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT’S
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT… I THINK I WAS ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BEFORE
THEY EVEN BECAME A THOUGHT PROCESS.

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
  PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

YEAH UM… HONESTLY I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN AFFECT ITS HAD. I’M NOT A…
HONESTLY, I’M NOT THE MOST LIKED PERSON IN THE CLASS. I’M A LITTLE
SELFISH AT TIMES. WHICH I’M WORKING ON BECAUSE ITS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED
HERE. UMM HONESTLY, WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES I DON’T KNOW
IF I COULD SAY ONE TYPE OF PERSONALITY COULD BE ANY DIFFERENT, LIKE
COULD OFFER YOU ANYTHING ELSE THAN ANOTHER KIND OF PERSONALITY. SO, I
DON’T KNOW IF I REALLY HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. LIKE I KNOW PEOPLE IN
THIS CLASS WHO ARE DISLIKED BY THE ENTIRE CLASS, AND PEOPLE TRIED TO
TELL THEM TO QUIT BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T LIKE THEM AS A PERSON AND THEY’RE
STILL HERE. IT MAY MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER IF YOU’RE MORE LIKED.

 SO YEAH, THAT’S LIKE AN EXTERNAL VIEW OF PERSONALITY. WHAT
  OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDER TO BE TRAITS OF YOU THAT WOULD PREDICT
  BEHAVIOR. UHH AND THEN THERE’S KIND OF THE SELF-ASSESSMENT. WHICH
  YOU PROBABLY SAW ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU COMPLETED ON THE
  TABLET. UHH THE PERSONALITY FACTORS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODELS.
  MAYBE YOU’VE DONE MEYERS-BRIGGS TEST LIKE MBTI. OR THERE’S SOME THAT
  HAVE ANOTHER, A SORT OF 5^(TH) DIMENSION, UHH, ONE THAT WE REFER TO
  IS OPENNESS, HOW OPEN YOU ARE TO NEW IDEAS OR EXPERIENCES.
  CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, HOW ORGANIZED YOU ARE. EXTRAVERSION.
  INTROVERSION. ARE YOU A SHY PERSON? DO YOU SEEK OUT PARTIES AND
  PEOPLE? DO YOU GET YOUR ENERGY FROM OTHERS OR HAVING SOME ALONE
  TIME? AGREEABLENESS. THAT’S SORT OF HOW FRIENDLY YOU ARE. AND THEN
  NEUROTICISM. WHICH HAS A BAD CONNOTATION WHEN YOU SAY SOMEONE IS
  NEUROTIC BUT IT’S A SPECTRUM, BEING SORT OF CATATONIC LIKE A CHILL
  KINDA SURF BUM TO BEING A SORT OF NAIL BITER AND JUST REALLY NERVOUS
  ABOUT THINGS. SO UHH ARE ANY OF THOSE TRAITS, HAVE ANY OF THEM HELD
  YOU BACK MAYBE? I HEARD MAYBE IN YOUR WEIGHT LIFTING MAYBE A DEGREE
  OF CONSCIENTIOUSNESS? SORT OF DISCIPLINED AND ORGANIZED? PURSUIT OF
  A GOAL? DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE?

DEFINITELY. THAT’S LITERALLY IN MY OPINION WHAT IS GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO
MAKE IT THROUGH OR NOT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU’RE ABLE TO MAKE THE TOUGH
DECISIONS NOW AND SEE DOWN THE ROAD. UMM BUT A LOT OF THE OTHER ONES.
FOR ME PERSONALLY. I DON’T THINK SO. OTHER THAN MAYBE AGREEABLENESS. I’M
THE SORT OF PERSON THAT I LIKE BEING THE BEST AT EVERYTHING. AND I
DIDN’T LIKE NOT BEING THE MOST AGREEABLE PERSON IN THE CLASS. YOU KNOW
LIKE, A LOT OF GUYS DIDN’T LIKE ME, I WAS VERY POLARIZING. SO A LOT OF
GUYS LIKED ME AND A LOT DIDN’T. SO MAYBE IF I WAS MORE AGREEABLE IT
WOULD HAVE HELPED ME A LITTLE MORE BUT OVERALL I DON’T THINK, I DON’T
THINK PERSONALLY IT HELPED ME AT ALL AND I DON’T SEE A CONSISTENT ONE OF
ANY OF THE TRAITS ACROSS THE BOARD. YOU KNOW LIKE I DON’T SEE ONE OF
THOSE TRAITS BEING SOMETHING EVERYBODY HAS. LIKE WE HAVE THE FULL
SPECTRUM ON PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN MY OPINION.

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING A PART
  OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY. LIKE DO YOU HAVE ANY SEAL FAMILY, FRIENDS,
  MENTORS, COACHES, OR FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL?

SO THE ONLY THING THAT EVEN GUIDED ME TOWARDS THE TEAMS WAS WHEN I WAS
IN SCHOOL I WROTE A PAPER ABOUT ADMIRAL MCRAVEN’S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.
SO WHEN I WROTE A PAPER ON THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE TEAMS AND THEN I
READ HIS BOOK AND I FOUND OUT MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE
TEAMS. AND I THOUGHT HEY MAYBE SOME DAY IF I EVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT WOULD BE COOL. BUT BEING A NUKE I HAD NO WAY OUT OF THE COMMUNITY,
LIKE I HAD TO BE A NUKE. SO I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED COMING HERE.

 SO HOW DID YOU WATCH THE SPEECH ORIGINALLY?

IT WAS ON YOUTUBE. SO ACTUALLY I THINK IT POPPED UP ON FACEBOOK, YA
KNOW. AND I WATCHED IT IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN I HAD TO WRITE A PAPER IN
COLLEGE AND I THOUGHT OF THAT AND I WROTE IT FOR THAT. BUT UMM I THINK
ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I’M HERE IS THAT I LIKE TO BE THE BEST AT
ANYTHING AND I FELT LIKE BEING A SEAL WOULD PUT ME THERE FOR MOST THINGS
IN LIFE. SO THAT’S WHY I’M HERE.

 SO I’M GOING TO PUT COMPETITIVENESS UNDER THE PERSONALITY
  QUESTION. SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. LIKE HOW YOU
  WERE DISCIPLINED? YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR FAMILY WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A
  GREAT COHESIVE GROUP THERE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR PARENTS
  PARENTING STYLE? WERE YOU SPANKED, WERE YOU SENT TO TIMEOUT, WAS IT
  FREE RANGE PARENTING?

WHEN I WAS YOUNG WE WERE DISCIPLINED WHEN WE NEEDED TO BE, BUT I DON’T
THINK I’VE EVER BEEN GROUNDED IN MY LIFE. UMM MY PARENTS WEREN’T OVERLY
DEMANDING. MY DAD WOULD BE LIKE YOU CAN’T HAVE ANY C’S. SO LIKE MY
PARENTS, MY DAD WAS JUST LIKE YOU CAN’T HAVE ANY C’S BUT I DON’T REALLY
CARE OTHER THAN THAT. UMM I THINK THE BIGGEST THINK WAS THAT THEY
DEMONSTRATED BY EXAMPLE. SO LIKE I’D WANT TO BE LIKE MY FATHER SO HE
WOULD LIKE SHOW ME WHAT I WOULD WANT TO BE LIKE. BUT I WAS NEVER REALLY
HEAVILY DISCIPLINED I DON’T THINK. THEY WEREN’T VERY STRICT.

 OKAY, DID THEY TAKE AWAY YOUR VIDEO GAMES OR WHAT WERE THE
  CONSEQUENCES IF YOU BROUGHT A C HOME?

UMM I THINK IT WAS MORE LIKE DISAPPOINTMENT, AND I DIDN’T LIKE
DISAPPOINTING THEM. I DON’T THINK I… LIKE I SAID I DON’T REMEMBER EVER
BEING HEAVILY PUNISHED. IF ME AND MY BROTHER EVER GOT IN A FIGHT OR
WHATEVER WE’D GET THE BELT BUT NOTHING LIKE… WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. MY MOM
WOULD GET THE OLD WOODEN SPOON OUT. YEAH NEVER… I DON’T THINK THEY WERE
OVERLY DISCIPLINING PARENTS.

 DID YOU MOVE AROUND DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD OR TEENAGE YEARS?

I DID NOT. I MEAN I’M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE’D MOVE AROUND TO
DIFFERENT HOUSES JUST BECAUSE MY MOM GETS BORED BUT WE NEVER MOVED FAR,
WE WERE PRETTY MUCH IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA THE ENTIRE TIME.

 DID MOVING HOUSES REQUIRE YOU TO CHANGE SCHOOLS OR SOCIAL
  GROUPS AT ALL?

NO, I WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN, ACTUALLY PRE-SCHOOL
ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL 8^(TH) GRADE. SO I WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL WITH THE
SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE. UM AND THEN I WENT TO A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL, THE
SAME HIGH SCHOOL FOR 4 YEARS.

 SO, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A
  TEAM SPORT OR ACTIVITY WITH A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY LIKE THEATER OR…?

UMM NO I PLAYED FOOTBALL FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. I WASN’T REALLY
SUPER INTO IT UHH… I WASN’T REALLY SUPER INTO THE SPORTS OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. I WAS VERY INTO, SO WE DID LIKE A LOT OF OFF-ROADING. WE’D
RIDE MOTORCYCLES OR DRIVE CARS. I WAS A MECHANIC SO I WORKED ON STUFF
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

 SO, WAS THAT A CLUB?

NO, JUST FRIENDS AT HOME. MY DAD IS A MECHANICISH, DOES MECHANICAL
THINGS.

 WHERE DID YOU GET THIS COMPETITIVENESS? DID YOU COMPETE ON
  MOTOCROSS OR…?

I DON’T KNOW ACTUALLY. I’VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, WHERE IT CAME
FROM. LITERALLY MY ENTIRE LIFE I’VE ALWAYS STRIVED TO BE, LIKE I’M NEVER
OKAY BEING LIKE ANOTHER PERSON IN THE CROWD. I’VE ALWAYS STRIVED TO BE
DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. I’M USUALLY DIFFERENT IN THE WAY OF
TRYING TO BE ABOVE EVERYBODY. UM, I EVEN DO THAT HERE, UM. I DON’T KNOW
WHERE THAT CAME FROM TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

 SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE? I THINK
  YOU’VE COVERED IT BEFORE. YOU HAD ROTC…

SO I JOINED THE NAVY OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IN 2014. UMM AND THEN I WENT
THROUGH NUKE SCHOOL 2014 INTO THE END OF 2015. AND THEN I WENT SEAMAN TO
ADMIRAL, SO I DID THAT UNTIL I LEFT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF 2018. WENT
BACK TO NUKE SCHOOL FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS TRYING TO GET BACK IN. AND THEN I
GOT SENT TO SAN DIEGO TO A SHIP AT THE END OF 2018. AS SOON AS I GOT TO
THE SHIP I APPLIED TO COME HERE. I GOT LUCKY. THE SHIP WAS IN THE SHIP
YARDS, MY CO WAS AN OLD NUKE SO HE HAD SYMPATHY FOR ME, AND HE HELPED ME
GET HERE.

 YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING THOUGH, TO BREAKOUT, AND HAVE A
  SUCCESSFUL PACKAGE?

SO WELL I MEAN I GRADUATED LIKE TOP OF MY CLASS FROM NUKE SCHOOL, AND
THEN I WAS A VERY GOOD… AND HAD NEARLY A 4.0 IN COLLEGE SO THOSE… BOTH
OF THOSE HELPED ME, ESPECIALLY WITH MY CO. BUT AS SOON AS I GOT TO MY
SHIP LIKE I KNEW I WANTED TO COME HERE, I KNEW I COULDN’T JUST YOU KNOW,
GO TO THE SHIP AND BLOW THAT OFF AND TRY TO COME HERE. I KNEW THAT WOULD
IRK A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO BASICALLY, WHEN I GOT TO THE SHIP, AGAIN I WAS
JUST TRYING TO BE THE BEST PERSON AROUND. I LEARNED EVERYTHING AS FAST
AS I COULD, GOT QUALIFIED AS FAST AS I COULD. WITHIN 3 MONTHS I HAD MADE
A MARK AND EVERYONE KINDA KNEW WHO I WAS ALREADY, AND I SAID THAT I
WANTED TO COME DO THIS. SO, THEY KINDA KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO AND THE
PACKAGE SUBMISSION TIME CAME AND I THREW IT ALL TOGETHER AND LUCKILY
LIKE I HAD SOME PEOPLE IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND THAT WERE WILLING TO HELP
ME OUT THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH WHERE I HAD BEEN AND WHERE I WANTED TO GO.
I WAS ABLE TO SUBMIT AND THEN I GOT SELECTED, I HAD PRETTY GOOD PHYSICAL
SCORES AND THEN MY PRIOR SUCCESS IN THE NAVY, EVEN THOUGH I HAD ONE
PRETTY BIG DOWNFALL. THE LAST THING, OH MY YEAR GROUP. THE YEAR I JOINED
THE NAVY THEY REALLY NEEDED SEALS FROM THAT YEAR. SO, THOSE ARE THE BIG
3 THINGS THAT HELPED ME GET HERE.

 SO SOUNDS LIKE SOME WORK AND ALSO SOME LUCK. WOULD YOU CONSIDER
  YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS THAT YOU
  GOT ON A WHIM?

I THINK I’D BE THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF IMPULSIVE. I TEND TO THINK THROUGH
EVERYTHING. I’M THE TYPE OF GUY THAT IF I WANT TO GO BUY SOMETHING ON
AMAZON I LOOK AT 50 REVIEWS BEFORE I EVEN CHOOSE TO BUY IT. I’M USUALLY
NOT INFLUENCED BY COMMERCIALS OR YOU KNOW MARKETING.

 SO DO YOU THINK THAT INCIDENT, GETTING ARRESTED, I MEAN FOR ME
  THAT’S A RED FLAG OF LIKE AN IMPULSIVE DECISION TOO?

THAT’S WHERE I THINK… THAT’S WHAT I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHEN I LOOKED BACK
ON IT. DO I HAVE A CHARACTER PROBLEM, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME
THAT I IMPULSIVELY MADE THE WRONG DECISION? BUT THAT’S HOW I FIGURED OUT
THAT I THINK IT’S BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS BEFOREHAND THAT KIND OF
GUIDED ME INTO MAKING THAT DECISION. UMM…

 SO YOU’RE MORE OF AN ANALYTICAL THINKER?

100 PERCENT, YES.

 OKAY, GREAT. WE’RE GETTING THERE. WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING
  COMPONENT OF BUD/S? SO THIS IS LIKE A HOLISTIC QUESTION. UH IT COULD
  BE LIKE YOUR HARDEST DAY, IT COULD BE… IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE YOU HAD
  SOME PERSONALITY COMPLEX. (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT
  BUD/S)

MHMM, WELL I DIDN’T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY PERSONALITY COMPLEX UNTIL WE WERE
ALL STUCK ON AN ISLAND FOR 5 WEEKS. PEOPLE LIKE SAW ME AS A PERSON AT
ALL TIMES OF THE DAY. NORMALLY LIKE WHEN I WAS AT WORK I’D BE AT WORK,
AND THEN WHEN I WENT HOME I’D DO MY OWN THING. THE BIG THING FOR ME WAS
THAT I WENT TO BED EARLY A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN I WAS ON THE ISLAND, AND
PEOPLE DIDN’T LIKE THAT. I’M ALSO THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I DON’T
OPERATE UNLESS I HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SLEEP. WHICH IS, UHH, DIFFERENT
THAN SOME PEOPLE. THE HARDEST THING I THINK FOR ME WAS UHH JUST THE
WATER. UMM I WAS NEVER REALLY A WATER PERSON I WAS BORDERLINE LIKE
AFRAID OF WATER. EVERY TIME WE HAD A BIG WATER EVOLUTION I’D BE VERY
NERVOUS ABOUT IT. IT’S WHAT I GOT ROLLED OUT OF 38 FOR. SO I THINK
WATER, ANY TIME WE DID A WATER EVOLUTION IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME.

 WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH THAT, WHEN YOU HAD THAT FEAR OR
  LACK OF CONFIDENCE?

AGAIN, I JUST THINK THE DEDICATION. THE BEING ABLE TO SEE THE BIGGER
PICTURE. THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS LEAVING HERE EVEN IF IT WAS FOR WATER.

 DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

I THINK, I DON’T KNOW. I THINK EVERYONE KIND OF GETS IN THEIR OWN HEAD.
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 2^(ND) PHASE IS ALL WATER AND EVERYONE IS KIND OF ON
THEIR OWN. PEOPLE AREN’T… LIKE PEOPLE KIND OF CHEER EACH OTHER ON AND
ARE LIKE, “HEY, GOOD LUCK. YOU GOT THIS.” BUT I NEVER REALLY GOT MUCH
OUT OF THAT. I THINK IT’S MORE OF I PUT IN THE HOURS AND I KNEW I WAS
ABLE TO DO IT, YA NOW.

 YOU FELT LIKE A “GO GET IT, YOU GOT IT, GOOD JOB” WAS…

JUST PEOPLE BEING NICE TO EACH OTHER. I WAS CONFIDENT IN MY OWN
ABILITIES TO DO THINGS. THAT’S THE ONLY COMFORT I HAD IN MY OPINION.

 ARE THERE ANY PRACTICES LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, OR SPIRITUAL
  THAT YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES? SO HERE WE’RE ASKING
  DO YOU PRAY, DO YOU HAVE A MANTRA, DO YOU DO VISUALIZATION
  EXERCISES? OFTEN TIMES ATHLETES WILL HAVE A WARMUP ROUTINE YA KNOW…

ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT IN THE MOMENT OR JUST???

 YEAH SO MAYBE BEFORE A WATER THING OR BEFORE A TOUGH EVOLUTION
  WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU DID OR A HABIT YOU HAD OR A PRAYER.

PROBABLY NOT. I WOULD REALLY TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT AND JUST THINK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. MAYBE VISUALIZATION A LITTLE BIT. I NEVER REALLY
HAD ANYTHING SET IN STONE THOUGH. PROBABLY SOME TIMES WHEN THINGS ARE
REALLY STRESSFUL IT’S JUST LIKE ANIMAL BRAIN AND YOU JUST SHUT DOWN AND
JUST LET THE THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. LIKE DURING POOL
COMP I JUST TRUSTED THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

 SO, YOU’RE GOOD AT KIND OF NUMBING YOURSELF. OR WOULD YOU SAY…

I THINK, YEAH PROBABLY. I FEEL LIKE I’M PRETTY GOOD AT NOT OVERTHINKING
THINGS WHEN I’M STRESSED OUT. JUST GO STEP BY STEP I GUESS. I DON’T
REALLY HAVE A GREAT ANSWER FOR THAT.

 DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR THAT, KIND OF LIKE “BEING IN THE MOMENT”

I MEAN WE CALL IT FRONT SIGHT FOCUS. IT’S LIKE LOOK AT THE CLOSEST GOAL
AND THEN FOCUS ON THE NEXT ONE. UH AND THAT CAN BE EXPANDED OR
CONTRACTED BASED ON THE TIME FRAME.

 WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TERM?

UMMM, I THINK ITS JUST A TERM THAT’S BEEN THROWN AROUND THIS COMMUNITY.
UH I DON’T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. I KNOW MASTER CHIEF MAGERATI
HAS A LOT OF STUFF BUT I DON’T KNOW IF ANY OF THAT HELPED ME
PARTICULARLY, MAYBE IT HELPED OTHER PEOPLE.

 SO YOU LEARNED THAT HERE?

YES. YEAH I DID.

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
  WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? UH, FOR
  EXAMPLE: RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASS MATE.
  UH, HOW DID YOU PROCESS THAT?

I’M TRYING TO THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE I MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION.
BECAUSE I NEVER DID ANYTHING… I MEAN SPECIFICALLY I DON’T REMEMBER
SPECIFICALLY DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IF I HAD TO I WOULD PROBABLY TRY
TO THINK OF WHAT’S GOING TO BE BEST. SO, WHEN I THINK OF THINGS LIKE
THAT… I GUESS PEER EVALS, I HAD TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS ON THOSE. AND UH,
MY THING COMES DOWN TO “HEY WOULD I TRUST THIS PERSON TO… WOULD I TRUST
THIS PERSON WITH MY LIFE DOWN RANGE.” REALLY THAT’S WHAT IT COMES DOWN
TO. UM THERE MAY BE PEOPLE I DON’T LIKE, BUT IF I CAN TRUST THEM TO SAVE
MY LIFE THEN THEY’RE FINE. YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE WERE PEOPLE I LIKED THAT
I GAVE NEGATIVE REVIEWS BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW IF I COULD TRUST THEM TO
SAVE MY LIFE.

 WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BUD/S AS
  COMPARED TO SOMEBODY ELSE?

AGAIN, PROBABLY LIKE DISCIPLINE. I HAVE DEVELOPED THAT ABILITY TO MAKE
THE HARD DECISIONS, (PAUSE AS YELLING IN BACKGROUND TO LOCK IT UP) UH TO
MAKE THOSE HARD DECISIONS BEFORE WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK THROUGH IT ALL.

 IS THERE ANYTHING DIFFERENT YOU NOTICED ABOUT THOSE THAT
  DROPPED?

UMM PROBABLY YEAH THEY JUST DIDN’T HAVE THAT ABILITY… THE ENVIRONMENT
WAS STRONGER THAN THEIR MIND WAS ABLE TO THINK. UM THEY WERE OVERCOME BY
THEIR CURRENT SITUATION RATHER THAN THE LONG TERM.

 SO YOU THINK THEIR MIND WAS WEAK AND THEIR BODY WAS?

I DON’T THINK IT’S A PHYSICAL THING OR AN INHERENT THING. I THINK ITS
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TRAINED. AND MAYBE THEY JUST DIDN’T HAVE THAT. AND
THERE WAS A COUPLE OF GUYS THAT I WAS SURPRISED. ONE OF THEM WHO WAS A
WRESTLER WHO QUIT. USUALLY WRESTLERS ARE VERY GOOD AT THAT
SELF-DISCIPLINE BECAUSE WRESTLING REQUIRES A LOT OF SELF-DISCIPLINE. BUT
YOU KNOW MAYBE HE DIDN’T USE HIS TIME AS A WRESTLER. I DON’T KNOW HIS
STORY. BUT I THINK STATISTICALLY WRESTLERS TEND TO DO PRETTY WELL.
ESPECIALLY ONES THAT CAN RUN. UMM. AND I THINK IT’S BECAUSE THEY HAVE
THAT DEVELOPED SELF DISCIPLINE.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE, AGAIN HOLISTICALLY,
  CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

THE ONLY THING I’VE NOTICED DIFFERENTLY IS THAT I’M LESS OKAY SITTING
AROUND RELAXING. I USED TO BE OKAY JUST CHILLING SITTING BACK WITH MY
FAMILY WASTING TIME. NOW I CONSTANTLY AM WANTING TO BE GOING. AND I
DON’T KNOW IF THAT’S JUST BECAUSE I’M USED TO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I’M
CONSTANTLY GOING BUT THAT’S THE ONLY THING I’VE NOTICED PRETTY CLEARLY.
LIKE I’M NOT GOOD AT SITTING AROUND AND RELAXING ANYMORE. I AM ALWAYS
WANTING TO BE DOING SOMETHING. SO THAT’S THE ONLY THING I’VE NOTICED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU THAT HELPED OR
  HURT YOU ABOUT BUD/S? ANYTHING ELSE, ANY QUESTIONS WE DIDN’T COVER?
  ESPECIALLY WHEN WE’RE COVERING THIS TOPIC OF GRIT, HARDINESS,
  RESILIENCE, MINDFULNESS.

I THINK WHAT I’VE TALKED ABOUT WITH SELF-DISCIPLINE IS THE BIGGEST THING
THAT I’VE LEARNED FROM IT. THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I’VE NOTICED THAT I
THOUGHT WAS PECULIAR WAS THAT A LOT… SO LIKE NORMALLY WALKING AROUND
AMERICAN SOCIETY MOST PEOPLE HAVE A SPORTS TEAM OR THEY’RE REALLY
INVOLVED IN SPORTS. I WOULD SAY 70% OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS CLASS DON’T
REALLY CARE ABOUT SPORTS OR DON’T REALLY CARE ABOUT SPORTS ANYMORE. THEY
DON’T REALLY HAVE A TEAM AND LIKE I WAS ALWAYS THAT PERSON BUT PEOPLE
ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD FOR NOT WATCHING SPORTS. LIKE HERE, ITS
COMPLETELY NORMAL TO NOT BE SUPER INVOLVED IN SPORTS. THAT’S ANOTHER
THING I NOTICED THAT WAS KIND OF PECULIAR.

 YEAH THAT IS, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP.

 OKAY WHAT IS YOUR PARTICIPANT ID NUMBER, THIS NUMBER RIGHT HERE

 113

 OK AND DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO RECORD

 YES

 OK AWESOME. CAN I ASK YOU GROWING UP HOW MANY SIBLINGS DID YOU HAVE

STUFF. I’D ALWAYS TRY TO HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE BE BETTER THAN THEM AT
THAT AND THEY'D BE BETTER THAN ME AT THIS THING AND I’D TRY TO WORK
HARD AND BE BETTER THAN THAM AT THAT, BUT RIDE BMX WE’D SNOWBOARD

 UM WHEN YOU WERE YA WHEN YOU WERE DOING WRESTLING IN COLLEGE WAS
THAT A D

 JUST A D3 SCHOOL

 OKAY DID IT ALL FOUR YEARS

 I DID IT FOR TWO YEARS AND I ENDED UP NOT GOING BACK FOR THE TEAM

 OKAY, UM WAS IT DID YOU FIND IT WERE YOU DROPPING WEIGHT OR TRYING
TO STAY WITH IT

 YA SO I WRESTLED 184 WAS THE WEIGHT CLASS I WAS LOSING LIKE 10
POUNDS A WEEK WHICH IS PRETTY AVERAGE FOR THAT LEVEL UM MY COACH HE’S
KINDA AN OLD SCHOOL STYLE HE WOULD UH HE WOULD SET LIKE PERIMETERS FOR
US AND WE’D BE DIFFERENT THAN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL WE’D HAD CURFEWS LIKE
OUR OFF SEASON LIKE OVER THE SUMMER HE’D BE REALLY STRICT ON DRINKING

 THIS IS IN HIGHSCHOOL OR

 COLLEGE

 SO COACH WAS STRICT

 YA VERY STRICT VERY OLD SCHOOL MENTALITY HE WAS LIKE 75 76 YEARS
OLD

 OK

 UM BASICALLY I GOT TIRED OF IT UM HE WAS KINDA NAGGING ME WHEN
I’D GO TO A PARTY OR SOMETHING LIKE OUT OF SEASON AND I WAS 21 LIKE
TWO YEARS AGO AND WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PARTIES AND I DON’T KNOW. YOU
KNOW IT WAS KINDA MY FAULT I WAS KINDA A DUMMY I DON’T KNOW

 JUST NORMAL COLLEGE

 RIGHT, YOU KNOW UH

 OK SO VERY STRICT AND CONTROLLING

 VERY CONTROLLING AND VERY MICROMANAGING AND I SAID YOU KNOW I’M
NOT GONNA DO THIS ANYMORE IT’S NOT FOR ME. I’M GONNA FOCUS ON GOING TO
BUDS SO THAT’S WHAT I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO TO BEGIN WITH

 SO THEY LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO BUDS YOU WERE IN THE FLEET

 YES

 SO ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENING IN THAT TIME, THINGS YOU WOULD DO ON A
DOWN TIME, LEAVE OR TRAVEL

 I REALLY LIKE TO GO OUT AND HIKE LIKE GET A COUPLE BUDDIES
TOGETHER AND GO OUT TO THE SHENANDOAH MOUNTAINS JUST RELAX GO SHOOT GO
HIKE, CAMP STUFF LIKE THAT

 OK

 TAKE MY FRIENDS JEEP OFF ROAD, KINDA LIKE FUN THINGS TO DO

SOMEONE IS LIKE DO YOU WANT TO GO DO THIS RIGHT NOW I’M LIKE YA SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN OR YOU WANNA LIEK CAN YOU GO HELP ME WITH THIS OR
CAN YOU GO DO THIS FOR ME LIKE YA OR I WOULD PRETTY MUCH I WOULDN;T
THINK IT THROUGH

 SPONTANEOUS

 SPONTANEOUS, YA MAYBE NOT IMPULSIVE BUT

 UHH DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS

 YES I HAVE FOUR

 OK WERE ANY OF THOSE SPONTANEOUS

 UH THE ONE ON MY RIGHT SIDE WAS

 OK, ON WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF IT

 UM IT WAS FOUR OF MY FRIENDS WE WERE JUST TOGETHER, GOOFING
AROUND AND TALKING ABOUT LIKE EAST COAST VERSUS WEST COAST MENTALITY
WE HAD A COUPLE BUDDIES FROM THE WEST COAST WHO WERE THE SURFER KINDA
GUYS AND WE WERE ALL LIKE KINDA I WOULDN’T SAY LIKE JUST LIKE BACK
WOOD YOU KNOW I MEAN LIKE KINDA NOT REDNECK BUT COUNTRY TYPE OF STYLE
YOU KNOW WE WERE SNOOPING AROUND IN THE WOODS SO WE GOT AN EAST COAST

 OK DO YOU HAVE SPEEDING TICKETS OR ANY OTHER

 I HAVE LIKE MINOR ONE, I GOT ONE IN VIRGINIA BEACH 3 OR 4 YEARS
AGO IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IT WASN’T LIKE ANYTHING IT WAS JUST LIKE 35 IN A
25 OR A 30 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

 SO NOTHING ELSE LIKE RECKLESS LIKE THAT

 NO NO

 OK, SO WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS

 THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO I WANNA BE THE BEST AT
...UNINTELLIGIBLE… WEIGHT LIFTING OR RUNNING OR SWIMMING OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT SO THINKING THAT WAKING UP THEIR A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TO
WARM UP TEN MINUTES BEFORE TRYING TO DO THAT

 WHEN YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST IS THAT COMPARED TO OTHER
PEOPLE OR IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO BE BETTER YOUR BEST SELF BETTER THAN
YOU WERE YESTERDAY

 YES

 YES TO BOTH

 YA BOTH YA ACTUALLY SO ONE OF MY MENTORS HE KINDA TOLD ME ABOUT
THIS ONE PERCENT RULE AND I KINDA REALLY I DIDN’T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT MEANT AT FIRST BUT I IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIGURE IT
BASICALLY SAID MAKE YOURSELF ONE PERCENT BETTER EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN
YOUR DOING SO IF YOUR PULLING YOURSELF AND GO BACK IN TIME THE DAY
BEFORE WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY THAT YOU DIDN’T DO YESTERDAY SO TRY TO
BETTER YOURSELF ONE PERCENT EVERYDAY

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF BUDS SO THINKING OF THE
ENTIRE EXPERIENCE HOLISTICALLY WAS THERE AN EVENT OR ENTIRE DAY

 UHH I THINK THE WORST THING FOR ME WAS CHEST CARRYING THE LOG,
LOG PT

 YA

 I DON’T KNOW WHY UM ITS I THOUGHT I HAD A PRETTY GOOD FOUNDATION
IN STRENGTH BUT THAT CRUSHED ME EVERYTIME

 SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET THROUGH IT?

 UM ITS KINDA LOOKING OVER AND SEEING OTHER GUYS SUFFER TO AND
SEEING SOMEONE WHO IS 18 19 I’D SAY MAYBE 160 150 POUNDS AND THEIR
RIGHT THERE SUFFERING RIGHT NEXT TO ME AND TRY NOT TO REPEAT SIX YEARS
AGO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

 YA UMM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP

 I DID UM THE BOAT CREW THAT I HAD WAS FOR THE MOST PART SOLID WE
HAD GUYS IN AND OUT BUT WE ALWAYS TRIED TO WIN EVERYTHING SO YOU KNOW
BEING THE FASTEST IN THE BOAT BEING THE FASTED ON THE LOGS SO WE
DIDN’T HAVE TO DO THE EXTRA PT SOMETIMES WE WOULDN’T BE THE BEST WED
ALWAYS TRY OUR HARDEST BUT MOST OF THE TIME WE DID REALLY WELL SO THAT
THE UHH THE CREW THAT I HAD WOULD ROTATE GUYS OUT FRESH GUYS IN ALL
THE TIME

 OK UH WHAT PRACTICES, PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL

 UH SO I DO A LOT OF VISUALIZATION THAT’S A BIG THING FOR ME

 OK

 SOMETIMES IT DOESN;T WORK FOR PEOPLE

 WERE YOU TAUGHT THAT HERE OR DOES IT COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE

 YA I LEARNED THAT HERE

 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE, DO YOU PRAY OR MEDITATE

 UM I I DON’T PERSONALLY UM I PROBABLY SHOULD HONESTLY

 DO YOU DO ANYTHING BEFORE PHYSICAL LIKE STRETCHING ROUTINE FROM
WRESTLING THAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU

 UH FOR ANYTHING PHYSICAL I TRY TO DO UH DYNAMIC WARMUP

 OK, DOES THAT ALSO GET YOUR MIND RIGHT

YA EXACTLY

 AND UM WHEN YOU MADE, CAN YOU THINK OF A TIME WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH
BUDS YOU DON’T MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF, DID YOU MAKE ANY
TOUGH DECISIONS? CAN YOU THINK OF AN EXAMPLE OF ONE AND WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HAD TO MAKE A DECISION

 UMM SO YA THERE THERE’S A TOUGH ONE UM ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHEN I
WAS IN MY ORIGINAL CLASS HE WAS IN MY BOAT AND WE WERE IN HELL WEEK
AND HE WAS SUPER BEAT UP BASICALLY MORE BEAT UP THEN THE REST LIKE
PHYSICALLY BEAT UP AND WE WEREN’T AS FAST AS WE COULD HAVE BEEN AND WE
WERE KINDA HOLDING BACK FOR HIM AND I BASICALLY TOLD THE BOAT CREW
WE’RE NOT GONNA RUN HIM OUT JUST CAUSE A LOT OF THAT WAS ON ME AND I
DIDN’T WANT TO SEE THIS GUY THAT I WORKED WITH FOR SIX YEARS GET SENT
HOME FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY DOESN’T REALLY
MATTER YA YOU CAN I DON’T KNOW, HE’S PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF BEING AN
EXCELLENT OPERATOR BUT HE JUST HAD A BAD LUCK BAD DRAW CARD

 SO YOUR DECISION WAS TO HOLD BACK THE REST OF THE CREW

 RIGHT SO I BASICALLY MADE THE EXECUTIVE DECISION THAT WE WERE NOT
GONNA RUN THIS GUY OUT OF THE CREW

 HELD BACK TO SAVE UM ONE MEMBER

YA

 AND WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AND THEN THE BIG PICTURE

 THE BIG PICTURE WAS I’LL TAKE THE BEATINGS JUST AS LONG AS HE
DOESN’T LEAVE

 LOYALTY TO THIS INDIVIDUAL

 YA EXACTLY AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
FOR AND THE WHOLE BOAT CREW WAS ON BOARD AND THE WHOLE BOAT CREW
THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD GUY AND IT WAS THE END OF HELL WEEK IT WAS LIKE
THURSDAY MORNING OR THURSDAY AFTERNOON SO WE KNEW HE WASN’T GONNA QUIT
SO

 OK

 JUST GOTTA PULL THE REINS BACK A LITTLE BIT

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THEN WHY DO YOU THINK
OTHERS WEREN’T YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

YA YA

 LIKE WHY DID YOU MAKE IT THROUGH AND WHAT WAS THERE SOMETHING LIKE
A TREND OR IN THOSE THAT FAILED OUT

 UM I THINK A LOT OF IT IS LUCK UM IN HARD WORK LUCK, HARD WORK
AND JUST THE WILL TO LIKE NO MATTER WHAT AND JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE AT ANYTHING HERE AND YOU SET YOUR ENTIRE LIFE YOU
KNOW DEVOTED YOUR ENTIRE LIFE TO MAKE IT THROUGH AND THEIR GONNA HAVE
TO KILL YOU TO GET YOU OFF YA

 SO FOR THOSE THAT FAILED OUT DORD OR DROPPED UM

THEY MIGHT OF HAD STRAIGHT UP BAD LUCK THEY COULD HAVE WORKED
HARDER, LOST THAT FIGHT, LOST THAT FIRE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE BAD LUCK
WOULD BE BROKEN LEG INJURY OR SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT ISN’T YOUR
KINDA OUT OF YOUR HANDS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

 HOW HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON

 YES I THINK SO, HOW, I THINK I’VE BECOME MORE INTROVERTED THAN
EXTROVERTED FROM WHEN I STARTED

 OK

 MAYBE THE LAST SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS I DON’T KNOW WHY MAYBE THE
WHOLE QUIET PROFESSIONAL THING I’M STARTING TO FIGURE THAT OUT

 UMM SO YOUR LIKE INTERNALIZING THAT

 YES YES TRYING TO APPLY THAT

 ANYTHING ELSE?

 NO I THINK THAT’S IT YOU

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I DIN’T TALK ABOUT THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE
ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR GRIT
RESILIENCE

 UM THE BIGGEST THING I CAN THINK OF IS IT SOUNDS KINDA CLICHE BUT
IT’S ALWAYS GONNA END AT THE END OF THE DAY YOUR GONNA GO HOME AND
YOUR GONNA TAKE A SHOWER AND YOUR GONNA EAT CAUSE THEY HAVE TO FEED
YOU THAT'S IF YOU CAN JUST THINK OF THAT, IF I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
THE FIRST TIME I’M NOT SAYING I WOULDN’T HAVE QUIT I KINDA GO TIN MY
HEAD I WOULD HAVE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MORE, I’D PROBABLY BE IN A
DIFFERENT SPOT YA

 GREAT YA I’M GONNA STOP IT

OK, so what’s your number, and is it OK if I record?

Yes. 118.

So, 118? OK. So thank you for agreeing to do this. I
appreciate that, im gonna just hold these. Uh, first of all, can you
tell me, like, how many siblings you have? And, what’s the birth order?
And, if they’re brothers, sisters?

I have one younger brother.

Alright. And then, what, if you think about your life
experiences, what might you describe as your crucible and life shaping
experience you had?

I guess one is probably that I came through BUD/S a while ago with
class 304 and quit, so that threw a wrench in the life plan for quite a
while.

OK.

That’s probably the biggest one.

And so, how did that impact your experience that you had
with this one?

Uh, it helped because I knew a little bit of what to expect in
first phase, but beyond that it didn’t really help much.

Yeah.

And I knew how much I knew I didn’t want to go back to the fleet,
so that helped motivate me.

And then, do you think your personality contributed to you
getting through BUD/S?

Uh, I think so, I was, I mean, I had six years to grow up and
mature within the navy which helped a lot. So, I think that helped,
perspective wise.

So what made you want to come back?

Immediately after I quit, I really wanted to come back for a while
and then I lost interest, but towards the end of my, my re-enlistment
was coming up, and it was something that I never really didn’t want to
do. I always really wanted to do it, and then I just got motivated again
and decided it was now or never.

So you re-enlisted to do this?

I’m on like an extension right now, but after SQT I will have to
re-enlist.

OK. Great. And then describe your background that led you
to even wanting to be a SEAL. Like, for example, so tell me about your
childhood, and how would you describe your parents’ parenting style. For
example, if they had to discipline you, what did they do?

Uhm, they would, uh, relatively little, like time outs, uhm then I
got older and they made me write sentences so many times...

OK.

If I did something wrong. That’s pretty much it.

And then, how about your teenage years. Did you move
around? Were you in sports?

Uh, I swam from when I was little all the way through college. I
lived in the same house, my parents still live in the same house.

Sometimes swimming can be very individual, sometimes it can
be team oriented. What would you say your swimming experience was?

Uh, once it got to college it was very team oriented, but prior to
that it was far more individual.

OK. OK. So what have you done in the last 5 years of your
life prior to BUD/S? And then, so you sound like you were in the Navy.
And would you consider yourself impulsive, like some people have lots of
tattoos, or do you binge drink? Do you have an impulsive tendency, do
you say?

Probably, yes.

Why do you say that? What makes you say that?

The tattoos, well, all of those were planned out. Uh, but, if I
decide I want to go buy something or go do something, I’ll usually just
go buy it or do it.

And then, what about, did you get an enlistment bonus? To
sign up for BUD/S?

When I first came in, there was a bonus if I had made it through,
and then the job I got after I quit, there was a bonus for that, and
there will be a bonus when I re-enlist eventually, but I didn’t get
anything to come back.

OK. So did the bonus come into play as far as when you
decided you were going to re-enlist?

No.

No? OK. What do you think motivates you on a daily basis?

Uh, I mean in BUD/S it was like the guys in the class. I wanted to
like *_undecipherable_*.

And what particular way? Not wanting to let people down? Or
like?

Yeah, like not wanting to let people down. Not wanting to fail in
front of them. Sometimes within my control *_undecipherable_*.

What would you say is the most challenging component of
BUD/S? So think about your hardest day. What helped you make...what was
challenging for you?

Uh, I don’t think there was any one day, it was just the total
grind of all of it.

Uh, huh.

It kinda starts to wear on you, especially going to San Clemente.
But, it was never anything like the first time through. Where, like the
day I quit, I was like “I can’t do this anymore.” I never felt that this
time. There were definitely hard days, but nothing crazy.

OK. And then, what motivated you on those hard days? What
made you motivated to push through? Like what were you thinking about?

Uh, how much it sucked to tell people I quit the first time and
not wanting to do that again.

OK. Did you feel like you were supported by the group?

Like the class?

Yes.

Yes.

And then, what practices did you use to help you get
through? Did you do meditation? Anything mental, spiritual, or physical
to get through all your challenges?

Uh, I like, on long runs or rucks where it hurts like bad, I would
just count in my head, or like day dream during the swims, or stuff like
that. But other than that, not really.

OK. When you made a difficult decision during training,
what went through your mind as you made that decision? Any decision that
you could have made.

Uh…

Can you think of anything?

Not really. There were times where I thought I was feeling pretty
shitty and we had to do things that most guys don’t wanna do, and it
was, just, we have to do it.

Uh huh.

Other than that, not really.

So why overall, do you think you were successful this time?

Uh, better physically prepared for it, and mentally I think. For
sure had a better *_undecipherable_*.

So before you had come straight from bootcamp?

Yes. I finished college, and then I came in right about seven
months after graduation.

Did you know anything different about those that didn’t
make it? Like can you describe what made you make it and not somebody
else?

Some of them were surprising, like some guys that you thought were
gonna make it. And other ones that were just, especially in first phase
weren't physically strong enough. Just some of the younger kids.

And then, how would you say this experience changed you as
a person?

Uh, gives you like a perspective on how bad things can be. And,
how easy almost everything we do is.

Anything else I should have asked you that you think would
be important to know for people coming in?

Uh, not really, no.

OK.

Make sure you’re good at running in the sand, I guess.

So what’s interesting is you’re only my second guy, and
both of you had come back. I thought that there was no way you could
even come back.

There’s a lot more in this class than normal.

Really? That’s awesome. OK. Thanks so much, I really
appreciate it.

OKAY SO I HAVE A SERIES OF EIGHT QUESTIONS WITH SOME SUB PARTS.

OKAY

SEVERAL OF THEM UH WE GOT ABOUT 15 MINUTES TO TRY AND GET THROUGH ALL OF
THEM. SO YA KNOW IF YOU CAN UH TRY AND BE THROUGH, BUT ALSO SOMEWHAT
CONCISE.

SURE.

ALRIGHT, BUT IF WE DON’T GET THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT’S FINE TOO.

SO WHEN DID YOU START UH BUD/S?

SO I WENT TO BUD/S A LONG TIME AGO IN 2008 WITH CLASS 272, DIDN’T MAKE
IT THROUGH THAT TIME.

WERE YOU ROLLED OR?

NO, I WAS DROPPED FOR DISCIPLINARY REASONS AND THEN I CAME BACK IN MARCH
OF 2019 WITH CLASS 338 AND I GOT PERFORMANCE ROLLED DURING THAT CLASS
AND THAT’S WHAT BROUGHT ME TO 339.

OKAY UHH 2008. HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

I HAVE TWO, AN OLDER BROTHER AND A YOUNGER SISTER.

SO YOU HAVE A BROTHER, YOU AND SISTER. AND UH WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTAL
SITUATION? YOUR PARENTAL SITUATION GROWING UP?

THEY’RE STILL TOGETHER, STILL ALIVE.

MOM AND DAD?

YES.

UMM WHAT’S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM LIKE?

UH ITS PRETTY GOOD, I GUESS ITS LIKE HASN’T BEEN GREAT SINCE I’VE BEEN
IN THE MILITARY FOR AWHILE AND I’M NOT AS CLOSE AS I USED TO BE WITH
THEM AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS SO 2016 DIDN’T HELP, BUT WE
ARE IN GOOD STANDING UH SOLID RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

SO WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?

UH THERE WERE SEVERAL. NOT MAKING IT THROUGH BUD/S WAS PRETTY LIFE
CHANGING IN 2008. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER BEEN HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY ACTIONS. UMM 2009, I GOT DIVORCED WHICH WAS EMOTIONALLY STRESSFUL
AND THAT 2009 WAS A ROUGH YEAR, [LAUGHS] I GOT ROBBED THAT YEAR TOO. UM
OTHER CHALLENGES IN MY LIFE, I WENT TO COLLEGE IN 2013, FIRST OF MY
FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE SO THAT WAS THAT WAS A WHOLE ADVENTURE, ENDED UP
GOING REALLY WELL. AND ALSO, I USED TO BE A COMPETITIVE ENDURANCE
ATHLETE AND I’VE RAN SOME REALLY HARD ULTRAMARATHONS.

HOW DOES THAT STUFF ALL FACTOR IN TO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S IN TERMS
OF MAYBE HOW YOU DID?

ABSOLUTELY, SO JUST DEALING WITH THE EMOTIONAL STRESSFUL THINGS, I KNEW
BUD/S WOULDN’T BE AS EMOTIONALLY STRESSFUL AS GETTING DIVORCED OR
GETTING ROBBED OR, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THEN AS FAR AS PHYSICAL
CHALLENGES AND INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES I KNEW THAT THEY WOULD BE SIMILAR
TO ULTRA RUNNING AND COLLEGE SO, SO I PICKED THOSE THINGS TO PREPARE FOR
THIS TRAINING.

HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR PROGRESSION
THROUGH BUD/S

KIND OF WORKED OUT NICELY, I’M A WORKAHOLIC

THIS IS PARTICIPANT ID 119

IT, IT WORKED OUT NICELY, CAUSE I’M A WORKAHOLIC AND THIS, BUD/S, IS A,
NOT A 9 TO 5 JOB IT'S LIKE A 16 HOUR DAY TYPE OF THING. UM. CAN YOU
REPEAT THE QUESTION ONE MORE TIME PLEASE?

JUST HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR EXPERIENCE
HERE?

UM I, I DON’T LIKE THE, THE, I’M NOT ONE THAT LIKE THINKS ABOUT MYSELF
FIRST, I’M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, WHAT IS, WHAT CAN HELP WHO THE
BEST, AND IT TURNS OUT THAT’S INCREDIBLY APPLICABLE TO THIS TRAINING.
CAUSE IT KEEPS YOU DISTRACTED FROM YOUR OWN HARDSHIPS, AND IT HELPS THE
CLASS SUCCEED MORE, SO IT, SO MY PERSONALITY FIT PRETTY WELL FOR THIS
TRAINING.

SO, DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LEAD YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING A SEAL.
LIKE, DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS, OR ANY
MILITARY FRIENDS FAMILY, OR HOW DID YOU, WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO?

I HAD AN UNCLE WHO RETIRED FROM THE ARMY, HE’S A LIEUTENANT COLONEL.
THEN MY BROTHER, HE’S A GUNNERY SERGEANT IN THE MARINE CORPS. AND SO
SERVICE WAS ALWAYS LIKE A, IT WASN’T UNUSUAL IN THE FAMILY, BUT
ULTIMATELY I HATE TO SAY IT BUT, AT THE TIME LIKE, THE SEALS WERE IN THE
NEWS A LOT AND THERE WERE MOVIES AND VIDEO GAMES AND IT WAS, EVERYBODY
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE, AND EVERYBODY KNEW THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERED THE
BEST. SO THAT’S WHAT ORIGINALLY DREW ME TO IT AND, AND NOW IT'S MORE
LIKE I, I SEE THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS, AND NOW IT'S
MORE LIKE A, A DRAW TO SERVICE, AND HOW I CAN DO THE MOST WITH MY TIME
HERE.

SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR UH, WE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR
CHILDHOOD, GROWING UP, EVENTS, UM. HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD?

UM, GET SPANKED.

SPANKED?

YEP.

AND I ASSUME EVERYTHING ELSE, TO, LIKE GROUNDING?

UM, THEY REALLY DIDN’T GROUND ME A LOT BUT THEY WOULD TAKE ELECTRONICS
AWAY, THAT, THAT WAS ANOTHER THING.

DID YOU MOVE A LOT IN YOUR TEEN YEARS, CHILDHOOD, TEEN YEARS?

NO.

ANY?

ZERO. ZERO TO EIGHTEEN I WAS IN THE SAME HOUSE.

WHEN YOU WERE IN AH, JUNIOR HIGH, HIGH SCHOOL, DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN,
IN ANY UH TEAM SPORTS?

I DID AH-

OR IN ANY KIND OF TEAM ACTIVITIES?

YEAH, SO AH, FOOTBALL, WRESTLING, AND TRACK AND FIELD. I GUESS TRACK AND
FIELDS, RUNNING, I GUESS(UNINTELLIGIBLE) BUT FOOTBALL, YES.

UM, ANYTHING ELSE, UM?

TEAM ORIENTED, I, I GUESS.

ANYTHING ACADEMIC, UM, ORIENTED, TEAM-ORIENTED?

YES, IN IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS IN THE ORCHESTRA, PLAYED THE CELLO. I THINK
THAT’S IT REALLY.

OKAY. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR THE LAST, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF YOUR
LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S NOW?

UM, I, I FINISHED UP COLLEGE TWO-THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. AND, AFTER THAT I
WORKED FOR AN ENGINEERING FIRM IN NEW YORK CITY. I WAS A MARINE ENGINEER
DIVER.

SO YOU WORKED FOR A MARINE ENGINEERING FIRM IN NEW YORK CITY?

YES.

THEN-

AND I WAS A MARINE ENGINEER DIVER, SO I PICKED THAT JOB SPECIFICALLY
FOR, FOR THIS BUT, UM.

SO WHAT DID, WAS THAT A CIV-THAT WAS, IN THE MARINES?

NO

SO IT WAS JUST A CIVILIAN JOB

IT WAS JUST A CIVILIAN JOB. SO THE MARINE ENGINEERING PART WE DID
WATERFRONT ENGINEERING SO DOCKS, PIERS, SEAWALLS, WHARFS LIKE THE WHOLE
HARBOUR AREA OF NEW YORK WE'D WE WOULD, I HAD A COMMERCIAL DIVING
CERTIFICATE, UH LICENSE, UH YEAH CERTIFICATION EXCUSE ME AND SO WE WOULD
GO DIVE THE STRUCTURES AND SWIM BACK DOWN UH THEN WRITE A REPORT ON THEM
AND PUT REPAIRS RECOMMENDATIONS STUFF LIKE THAT

THAT WAS LIKE IN THE HUDSON OR THE EAST RIVER?

YES, BOTH, YUP... AND HE'S GIVING THEM THE PLAN OF THE DAY, BUT UM YEAH
IT WAS... (UNINTELLIGIBLE 38-41)... ON THAT WE WERE A FOUR OR FIVE
MAN DIVE TEAM FOR THOSE THINGS.

SO YOU WERE IN THE NAVY BEFORE…?

YES

SO YOU WENT TO BUD/S IN 2008?

YES

AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED AFTER BUD/S?

I WAS AN AIRCREWMAN. SO I, BUD/S DIDN'T WORK OUT I WENT TO AIRCREW
SCHOOL IN PENSACOLA FLORIDA. UH AFTER THAT I GOT STATIONED IN OKLAHOMA
UH I FLEW ON E-6B MERCURYS FOR THREE YEARS, GOT OUT IN 2012, WENT TO
COLLEGE FROM...

16?

YEAH 2016 WENT TO WORK FOR AN ENGINEERING FIRM FROM 2016 TO 2018 AND
THEN UH REJOINED THE NAVY AFTER THAT.

WHERE IN OKLAHOMA?

UH RIGHT NEAR OKLAHOMA STATE BASE CALLED TINKER AFB

I GREW UP IN TULSA SO.

OH REALLY? REALLY? I MISS THERE. I LOVE THAT TOWN. I LOVED IT.

I COULDN'T WAIT TO LEAVE

HAHA

I GREW UP THERE UH FROM UM FOURTH GRADE TO HIGHSCHOOL. UM WOULD YOU
CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

NO NO.

DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

NO

APPARENTLY A MEASURE OF IMPULSIVITY I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WHAT WAS THE
MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S?

UH FIRST PHASE, THE PHYSICAL GRIND OF IT ALL. I, I THOUGHT I TRAINED
WELL WITH ALL THE ULTRA RUNNING BUT THIS WAS MORE OF LIKE A WHOLE BODY
WEAR DOWN AND MAINTAINING JOINTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WAS THE THE
HARDEST PART FOR ME. ESPECIALLY CUZ I’M OLDER.

HUH?

ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I’M OLDER.

YEAH. SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH?

UH A COUPLE THINGS. KNOWING THAT I KINDA SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE TRYING TO
GET HERE WAS A BIG MOTIVATOR LIKE I DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE TIME. I DIDN'T
WANT TO WASTE ALL THAT TIME. MY MY WIFE UM SHE IS TOTALLY BOUGHT INTO
THE IDEA AND I DIDNT WANT TO LET HER DOWN AND UM THE COMRADERY, THE
COMRADERY.

WHAT KINDS OF PRACTICES DID YOU USE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL WHATEVER
UH TO GET THROUGH CHALLENGES?

FOR BUDS SPECIFICALLY ONE THING THAT REALLY HELPED ME WAS TELLING MYSELF
I HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS. IT WAS EITHER PROGRESS AND GET THROUGH OR EH
THERE WERE NO OTHER OPTIONS. I LITERALLY TOLD MYSELF EITHER THEY’RE
GONNA HAUL OUT ON AN AMBULANCE OR I'M GONNA GET THROUGH.

WHEN YOU MADE DIFFICULT DECISIONS DURING BUD/S UM WHAT WENT EVENTS OR
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND UH MAKING THE DECISION AND WHAT KIND OF
DECISIONS DID YOU STRUGGLE WITH UH THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY HAVE HERE ARE
RUNNING CLASSMATE OUT OR TURNING IN SOMEONE FOR CHEATING

WE, I’VE HAD A COUPLE OF, SO I THINK OF IT AS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
CONTEXTS, THE FIRST ONE WAS LIKE IF WE ALL MADE IT THROUGH AND WE’RE
WORKING TOGETHER CAN I TRUST THIS PERSON? THAT WAS THE MAJOR WAY THAT I
MADE DECISIONS OR THAT ANOTHER ONE WAS DID THIS PERSON UH COMPROMISE THE
CLASS WITH THEIR ACTIONS? SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WHAT WE HAD A GUY WHO STAYED
OUT TOO LATE DRINKING DIDN’T MAKE IT BACK FOR CURFEW LIKE I ENDED UP
TURNING HIM IN AND HE GOT IN TROUBLE WITH THE CLASS BECAUSE HE WAS A
LIABILITY TO THE CLASS AND LIKE SCREWING US OVER AND A FEW HAD GOTTEN
CAUGHT. SO THOSE WERE SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE

SO YOU THINK ABOUT NOT JUST HOW IT HURTS THEM BUT HOW KEEPING THEM IN
HURTS EVERYBODY ELSE

YEAH LIKE THE LONG TERM PICTURE, AND EVEN LIKE ON DEPLOYMENTS LIKE CAN I
TRUST THIS PERSON ETHICALLY BECAUSE THERE’S A MAGNIFYING GLASS ON THE
COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW, SO ALL THOSE THINGS FACTOR IN

SO WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S, I MEAN
YOU’VE ALREADY SORT OF GIVEN ME SOME OF THAT, BUT IS THERE ANYTHING
LIKE?

UH PREPARATION, THEN ANOTHER BIG THING IS UM I DON’T KNOW THIS MIGHT
SOUND WEIRD BUT LIKE HAVING PEOPLE LIKE YOU IS IS I MEAN IT’S IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THEY’RE LESS LIKELY TO WANNA RUN YOU OUT OF [UNINTELLIGIBLE] SO
BEING COOPERATIVE AND A TEAM PLAYER WERE BIG [UNINTELLIGIBLE] FOR THAT

DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT
THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HERE?

UM I’D I’D SAY FOR THE MOST PART ITS LIKE THE SERIOUSNESS FROM WHICH
THEY APPROACH TRAINING, YEAH THERE THERE ARE A FEW GUYS WHO ARE STILL
JOKESTERS WHO DON’T LIKE TAKE THIS TOO SERIOUSLY BUT FOR THE MOST PART
GUYS ARE MUCH MORE FOCUSED THAN THOSE WHO DIDN’T MAKE IT THROUGH

HAS THIS EXPERIENCE AND IF SO HAS IT CHANGED HOW HAS IT CHANGED YOU AS A
PERSON?

UH MUCH MORE AWARE OF STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. THIS TRAINING IS AMAZING
AT DETERMINING THOSE THINGS. UM AND CONFIDENCE LIKE IF YOU CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THIS YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING, ANYTHING

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD OF ASKED YOU, THAT UM HELPED YOU OR
HURT YOU IN GETTING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OR DID WE COVER EVERYTHING?

UM I GUESS I GUESS I FOUND THAT THAT AGE DID PLAY LIKE A BIG FACTOR

IT DID?

YES, YES, IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME FOR THE OLDER GUYS, LIKE A LOT OF
MAINTENANCE TIME VERSUS A LOT OF THE YOUNGER GUYS WHO ARE WHOSE BODIES
ARE MORE RESILIENT AND I I THINK THAT’S WHY THERE’S SO FEW GUYS THAT ARE
30 THAT MAKE IT THROUGH

I MEAN THE CAP IS WHAT 30, THE CAP MIGHT BE LIKE 30

IT UH IT IS, YOU HAVE TO GET AN AGE WAIVER AFTER 30, SO THERE THERE ARE
3 OF US WHO HAD TO GET THAT TO BE HERE SO IT’S DEFINITELY A YOUNG MAN’S
GAME

WELL BELIEVE ME IT JUST GETS WORSE

YEAH AND THE VERY LAST THING WHICH KINDA GOING BACK TO I THINK THE
SERIOUSNESS IN HOW SOME PEOPLE APPROACH TRAINING IS LIKE REFLECTIVE OF
THEIR LEVEL OF MATURITY, LIKE I WAS I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED BY HOW MATURE
MOST OF MY CLASSMATES ARE.

OKAY

I THINK THAT’S IT

WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT THROUGH

I APPRECIATE THAT

IS IT OK IF I RECORD?

YES.

AND WHAT IS YOUR PARTICIPANT ID?

120.

EASY QUESTIONS FIRST. WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S, IS 339 YOUR FIRST?

NO I ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH CLASS 335 UH GOT ROLLED IN FIRST PHASE IN
THE POOL, CLASSED BACK UP WITH 338 IN BO AND GOT ALL THE WAY TO THIRD
PHASE WITH 338 BEFORE GOING TO 339.

OK SO YOU GOT ALL THE WAY TO THIRD PHASE WITH 338 THEN TO 339?

YES.

SO THAT’S SOME PERSEVERANCE.

A LITTLE BIT.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THIRD PHASE DURING 338?

I WAS UH DOING LAND NAVIGATION AND SLIPPED OFF DOWN THE SLIDE OF A SLOPE
AND CHIPPED MY TOOTH.

OH GOSH, SO ANOTHER MEDICAL ROLLBACK?

YES ANOTHER MEDICAL ROLLBACK.

HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

I HAVE UH TWO SISTERS UH ONE IS JUST TURNED 18 A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND THE OTHER IS 10 YEARS OLD.

AND YOU’RE THE OLDEST THEN?

I AM.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PARENT SITUATION, DO YOU HAVE A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD?

I HAVE TWO PARENTS, MY MOM AND MY STEP DAD UH MY STEP DAD HAS BEEN
AROUND SINCE I WAS TWO HE’S MY DAD

DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH YOUR BIRTH DAD?

UM NO I HAVEN’T TALKED TO HIM.

WHAT’S THEIR SITUATION LIKE AT HOME? LOVING HOUSEHOLD?

ITS VERY DIFFERENT LAND OUT THERE!

VERY BARREN.

ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO COMING TO BUD/S?

UH SENIOR YEAR FOOTBALL, I GOT A HERNIA THE FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON AND
HAD TO GET SURGERY THE NEXT DAY AND COULDN’T PLAY FOOTBALL THE REST OF
THE SENIOR YEAR SEASON. VERY TRAUMATIC FOR ME I THOUGHT I HAD WORKED ALL
HIGH SCHOOL AND SENIOR YEAR WAS KINDA OVER RIGHT THERE.

DO YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU HAD TWO MEDICAL ROLLBACKS THAT HELPED YOU GET
THROUGH?

UH YA SO I KINDA CORRELATED IT A LOT ITS JUST ANOTHER ONE THING THAT
HAPPENED ITS LIKE MIGHT AS WELL PUSH ON WITH IT.

DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE OR ARE YOU COMING STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL I LOOKED INTO COLLEGES BUT UH WASN’T REALLY
FOCUSED ON THE SCHOOL ASPECT OF IT AND SAID YOU KNOW MIGHT AS WELL GO
FOR IT.

SO YOU WENT TO BOOT CAMP THEN CAME HERE?

YEAH SO I WENT TO BOOTCAMP IN JULY OF 2018 I WAS 17 AT THE TIME AND HAD
MY MOM SIGN A FORM.

WHEN DID 335 START?

WE GOT HERE DECEMBER 3RD OF 2018.

AND BEEN IN SAN DIEGO EVER SINCE?

YEP ITS BEEN A LITTLE WHILE NOW.

HOW DID ANY OF YOUR EXPERIENCES FROM CHILDHOOD FACTOR INTO YOUR
EXPERIENCES HERE AT BUD/S?

I WOULD MAINLY SAY THAT MY MOM WAS VERY STRICT SO IT CORRELATES VERY
EASILY WITH INSTRUCTORS BEING UP YOUR BUTT ALL THE TIME JUST LIKE MY
MOM, SHE ALSO NEVER LET ME HAVE AN EXCUSE AND WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO SO GET IT DONE. I CAME OUT HERE AND THEY TREAT ME JUST LIKE
MY MOTHER DID.

WHAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF HER STRICTNESS?

UM THERE WAS JUST NO ROOM FOR ERROR, SHE KNEW FROM A YOUNG AGE THAT I
WANTED TO COME OUT HERE AND DO THIS SO SHE ALWAYS HELD ME ACCOUNTABLE
AND JUST NEVER LET ME SLACK OFF. SIT ON THE COUCH TOO LONG AND SHE WOULD
MAKE YOU GO FIND SOMETHING TO DO.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY AND HOW THAT CONTRIBUTED TO GETTING THROUGH
BUD/S?

UH I WILL DEFINITELY SAY A LOT OF THESE GUYS WHO ARE OLDER AND OUT OF
COLLEGE ARE A LOT MORE MATURE THAN ME AND THEY HAVE TAUGHT ME A LOT. UM
AND I TALK A LOT JUMP AROUND A LOT BUT THEY WOULD HELP ME MOVE DOWN TO
UH MORE THEIR LEVEL … I’M JUST LIKE YOUNG, SMART, A LOT OF ENERGY.

ARE YOU LIGHTHEARTED OR MORE SERIOUS?

I WOULD SAY I’M MORE LIGHTHEARTED I TAKE SOME THINGS SERIOUSLY YOU KNOW.

DO YOU THINK THAT HELPED?

I THINK THAT DOES HELP BECAUSE THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE IN THE CLASS WHO
KEEPS THE MORALE UP AND THEN THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO GETS THEM WHERE
THEY NEED TO GO.

THAT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME I’VE HEARD THAT LIGHTHEARTEDNESS HELPS A LOT,
SO NOT A BAD THING. WHAT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND LED YOU TO WANT TO JOIN
THE SEAL COMMUNITY?

UM I WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD AT A FAMILY BARBEQUE AND UH I KNEW I
WANTED TO BE IN THE MILITARY FROM A YOUNG AGE AND MY UNCLE WAS LIKE THE
NAVY SEALS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST SO IF YOU WANT TO BE THE UH BEST
WARRIOR BE A NAVY SEAL AND I SAID OK AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY.

NOW WAS ANYBODY A SEAL IN YOUR FAMILY?

NOPE UH NOBODY WAS UH EXCEPT FOR MY GRANDFATHER HE WAS A MARINE IN WORLD
WAR II.

NO OTHER MILITARY?

NO.

BUT YOU FROM AN EARLY AGE WANTED TO BE IN THE MILITARY? WHAT MADE YOU
WANT TO BE IN THE MILITARY?

UH I WAS JUST I ALWAYS LIKED STRUCTURE LIKE UH I HAD LIKE AN INTERNAL
CLOCK LIKE AT THIS TIME I WANTED TO GET READY SO I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
SOMETHING STRUCTURED AND ALWAYS THOUGHT BEING A SOLIDER WAS COOL SO I
WANTED TO BE A SOLDIER AS A KID.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, WHAT WAS PARENTING STYLE AND DISCIPLINE?

SO UH MY MOM WAS DEFINITELY ALWAYS THE RULER OF THE HOUSEHOLD UH SHE
SAID SOMETHING EVERYONE GOES BY IT, MY DAD WAS ALWAYS MORE OF THE
SUPPORTIVE DAD. SUPPORTED WHAT SHE SAID OF COURSE BUT ALSO BEHIND HER
BACK HELPS US OUT UH HE COULD ALSO BE STRICT AT TIMES TOO ESPECIALLY FOR
ME TOO SINCE I’M THE OLDEST BOY.

WHAT WAS DISCIPLINE LIKE? SPANKING?

UH YOUNG AGE THERE WAS SPANKING AND THEN WHEN I GOT A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR
THAT THEY WOULD JUST MAKE ME SIT IN MY ROOM.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS?

UH TEENAGE YEARS I JUST UH DID A LOT OF SKIP SCHOOL AND TRY TO GO GET
MCDONALDS UH … OTHER THAN THAT JUST GO MESS AROUND IN THE DESERT ON THE
ROCKS YOU KNOW.

WOULD YOU SAY THAT IN SCHOOL, HOW FOCUSED WERE YOU?

UH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CLASS WAS I LIKED HISTORY I LIKED OF COURSE PE
BUT MATH I HATED MATH BUT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT VERY WELL SO I WAS ALWAYS
IN THE ACCELERATED MATH CLASSES BUT DIDN’T WANT TO SIT IN THE CLASS AND
DO IT SO I WOULD ALWAYS BE THE JOKER IN THE CLASS OR JUST SIT IN THE
CLASS AND DOODLE.

TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR SPORTS EXPERIENCE, FOOTBALL, WHAT YOU LIKED
ABOUT IT AND DIDN’T?

UH I LIKED THE TEAMWORK, JUST LIKE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF IT, OF COURSE
THE BIG STADIUM LIGHTS.

HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE PLAYED INTO IT?

UH DEFINITELY YOU HAVE TO WORK AS A TEAM HERE IF YOU CAN’T BE A TEAM
PLAYER THEN YOU HAVE LIKE RIPS AND TEARS. EVERYTHING WORKS BETTER AS A
TEAM OF COURSE THERE’S ALSO LIKE INDIVIDUAL WORK HERE JUST LIKE FOOTBALL
IF YOU’RE NOT GOING TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN AND WORKOUT ITS NOT GOING TO
CORRELATE LIKE SKILLSWISE … IT JUST HELPS YOU WITH LIKE YOU GOT TO WIN
THE BIG GAME ALL THE TIME.

WHAT ABOUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS BEFORE BUD/S? HIGHSCHOOL STRAIGHT TO
BOOTCAMP THEN BUD/S?

YES HIGH SCHOOL STRAIGHT TO BOOTCAMP AND THEN BUD/S.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UHM NO LOOKING BACK AT IT IT WAS LIKE REALLY SHORT WHEN I GRADUATED AND
JOINED THE NAVY BUT UH I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS PRIOR IT
WAS JUST FINALLY TIME TO BE SERIOUS.

WHAT ABOUT TATTOOS, IMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS LIKE SPEEDING TICKETS?

NO I DON’T HAVE ANY SPEEDING TICKETS. I WANT TO GET A TATTOO BUT YOU
KNOW, GOT TO WAIT.

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S?

UH JUST THE EVERY DAY YOU GOT TO WAKE UP AND YOU KNOW ITS NOT GOING TO
BE FUN BUT YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH IT BUT EVERYONE ELSE HAS GOT TO DO IT
TOO.

WHAT HELPED YOU GET THROUGH THAT? THAT’S A LONG TIME TO HAVE TO GET
THROUGH.

YOU FIND GUYS WHO YOU WORK WITH WHO ARE YOU KNOW YOUR SAME HEIGHT AND IN
THE SAME BOAT CREW WITH THEM AND THEY’RE GUYS WHO WANT TO BE HERE TOO
AND YOU JUST PUSH EACH OTHER AND JUST JOKE AROUND WHEN YOU CAN AND IT
JUST MAKES THE DAY GO BY A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

WHAT ABOUT FOR YOU? SINCE YOU’RE YOUNGER THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE, KIND OF
THE OUTLIER, WAS IT HARDER TO GET PEOPLE TO BE A PART OF YOUR SUPPORT
GROUP?

NO I WOULD SAY THAT I WAS KIND OF LIKE THE YOUNGER BROTHER WHO IS EASY
TO TALK TO, YOU KNOW THE OLDER GUYS CAN BE A LITTLE SCARY TO TALK TO BUT
I’M JUST EASY TO TALK TO AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN TOO SO THEY
JUST COME AND COACH AND TEACH TOO.

WHAT ABOUT ANYTHING YOU DID PHYSICAL, MENTAL, OR SPIRITUAL THAT HELPED
YOU GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS?

UM DIDN’T DO ANYTHING PHYSICALLY BESIDES JUST TRYING TO EAT MORE
CALORIES JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I DIDN’T DO GOOD AT WHAT I NEED TO
DO BETTER.

ANY SPIRITUAL COMPONENT FOR YOU?

UM SOMETIMES I WOULD PRAY A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE, BUT NOT ON A
REGULAR BASIS.

ANYTIME YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION HERE? ETHICAL OR MORAL OR
PERSONAL OR WATCHING SOMEONE ELSE DO SOMETHING?

UH IT WAS HARD, YOU THINK A LOT ABOUT IT AND THEN YOU ASK YOUR FRIEND
WHAT WOULD THEY DO. I CAN’T REALLY THINK OF ANYTHING THAT COMES TO MIND
THOUGH.

WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN BUD/S?

UH I’M STUBBORN.

TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.

UH IF I PUT MY MIND TO SOMETHING ITS GOING TO STAY THERE A WHILE AND …
ITS JUST LIKE … I DON’T WANT TO GET UP AND LEAVE AND THEN HAVE TO TRY
THIS LATER ITS JUST LIKE DO IT NOW AND IT SUCKS BUT WHATEVER YOU’LL
LIVE.

ANYTHING THAT YOU NOTICED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT VERSE THOSE WHO
QUIT? SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO QUIT?

UM I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THEY HAD LIKE SOMETHING ALWAYS LIKE LIMITING THEM
LIKE MENTALLY I’M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE UNCERTAIN OF THEIR CAPABILITIES
OR UH THEY JUST DIDN’T LIKE BEING HURT OR TRAINING BUT I COULD TELL GUYS
WHO MADE IT COULD SUCK IT UP OR THEY’LL FIND SOMETHING TO LAUGH ABOUT.

DOES LAUGHTER PLAY A BIG ROLE IN GETTING THROUGH THIS?

UH AT TIMES YEAH, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU GET THROUGH SOMETHING HARD IT
HELPS LIKE JUST RELIEVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF STRESS AND THEN GET FOCUSED
ON THE NEXT TASK.

HOW HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

I’VE DEFINITELY MATURED UH IT’S TAUGHT ME A LOT OF LIKE HOW HARD WORK
CAN GET YOU ANYWHERE YOU GOT TO GO I’VE NEVER REALLY EXPERIENCED THAT
BEFORE IN HIGH SCHOOL. JUST SHOWS LIKE IF YOU’RE WILLING YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING.

ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU THAT I DIDN’T?

NOPE.

WELL YOU’RE ALL DONE THEN, CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD LUCK.

THANK YOU.

Is it ok if I record this interview?

Yes.

And what is your particpant ID?

123.

Ok easy questions first, when did you start BUD/S?

I think we got here June 10 of 2019.

And you were in 338?

Yeah originally.
When did you get rolled into 339?

It was after Lifesaving in First Phase.

When that happens do you go back to the beginning of first phase?

No you jump in with the next class after Hell Week.

Well that’s good.
Yes yes.

How many siblings do you have?

Three.

And what’s the birth order?

I’m the oldest and then I have a 25 soon to be 26 year old sister, a 16
year old brother, and an 8 year old brother.

What’s your parent situation? Two parent household?

Uh yeah, divorced at I think I was like two so separate households from
then on and then … kinda bounced school districts in the middle of high
school like in 10th grade I went from living with my mom my whole life
to living with my dad so dealt with that whole move and then switching
of the schools and then unfortunately after college I was almost done
with college I moved to Philadelphia to do so and then I lost my father
… so then came after college moved in with my aunt and uncle while
looking for a job.

So where did you grow up?

In Pennsylvania.

And then you went to school in Philadelphia?

Yeah right outside of Philly it’s called Eastern University.

Ah I know the area.

Are you from there?

No I’m actually from Maryland but I know the area

So you grew up with your father starting midway through highschool and
then you don’t have to share but can I ask why you moved in midway
through high school?

Um yeah that’s fine my mom was going through another divorce and we had
to move out of that house into a town house and was going through the
typical teenage youth not really getting along at the moment so she
kicked me out and then I moved in with him.

Ok and then your sisters are they full sisters or half?

One sister is full sister and then the 16 year old is on my mom’s side
and 8 year old is on my dad’s side.

Any life changing experiences prior to BUD/S?

Um definitely my dad passing away.

Was that a surprise?

Kind of but not really … so he ended up being diagnosed with cancer,
fought it, won it. Healed and then took a huge blow and it just went
downhill fast. So I actually was in college, quite college and came back
to try to help out with that and then after went back to college.

And how long did you take off college?

A semester.
And then how do you think that factored into your experience here at
BUD/S?

Uh I just … anytime that it got hard you just think back on those
moments because that was the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through.
Because you think about your dad he’s your mentor … your huge dad he’s
like 6’1” 240 lbs just solid muscle, worked construction. Have him every
weekend and every week during the summer. That man who can lift cinder
blocks for days and then he can’t even get out of the tub. Just helping
him drive places and helping him get in and out of bed that just took
more of a toll than anything so anytime it got tough out here just
thinking that if I was in pain how was he doing what he went through.

Tell me about your personality and how you think it contributed to going
through BUD/S?

I mean the hard working aspect … I think the stubborness is number one
honestly that whole factor of when people tell you to quit or don’t
think you can do something the stubborn factor just outweighs everything
because now I definitely will just because you don’t think I can. … Uh
definitely humor you know I would say that’s a huge part of it … having
a good laugh whenever shit hits the fan because they try to get you down
all the time so just whenever you would find a way or find people to
make one thing funny to aleviate that stress or pain that’s happening so
yeah I think that’s huge that stubborness or finding humor in things.

What about your family background made you want to become a SEAL?

Always just trying to be the best in any aspect whether its growing up I
played a lot of sports so trying to be the best guy out there or the
competitiveness so trying to win everything so going through that and
growing up hearing different options of what you want to do and you hear
that they’re the best in the world it definitely peaks an interest
because where better to go than to be the best of the best.

What about any military in your family or friends that were SEALs?

No it was just my one buddy who would always talk about it with me in
wrestling in high school but unfortunately he didn’t end up going
through with me.

So what was your parents discipline style, spanking, time out, toys
taken away?

Um I would say a little bit of everything so like the wooden spoon
whenever something would happen … or getting sent to your room … I guess
that isn’t a punishment… but yeah it was the wooden spoon until one time
they hit me with it and it broke and I laughed and I guess that was the
end of that.

So we talked about your teenage years but tell me about activities you
did, sports etc.

So growing up it was sports all year round. It went from baseball in the
spring to wrestling in the winter and football in the fall so I didn’t
even have a break and sometimes I would miss the first couple practices
because that other season was still going on so it was just like day in
and day out … and that wasn’t like a punishment I liked that.

Was there a sport that you liked better than the other?

Um when I was young no whatever sport I was doing was my favorite of all
time but when I got older I had to give up football in high school
because there wasn’t enough time and then when I got to college I had to
give up wrestling just because baseball took over everything.

So you played baseball in college?

Yes.

So talk to me a little bit about the last 5 years before coming here. So
you leave college then what?

So in college in my senior year … I tore my shoulder apart, had surgery
on my rotator labrum and bicep tendon so that was part of the recovery.
I immediately came home and got a job working at a warehouse for Amazon
and while I was doing that just from playing sports growing up I was big
into weight lifting so that was a big part of my regiment then so I
would say it was probably about a year into working at Amazon I decided
that I just wasn’t … this was not for me I was not enjoying it I didn’t
like working behind a desk and if I was going to pursue this thing with
the Navy you know I was already twenty-six so time was already dwindling
down.

So then did you go to boot camp?

Yep so then boot camp and I had to jump through all these hoops because
of my shoulder but then yeah it was bootcamp for two months then Prep
for a month and then out here to start this process.

So what year did you graduate college?

2015.

Then you worked at Amazon for how long?

Up until I left so 2018 so about 3 years.

Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?

(laughing) I guess it depends on who you ask.

So for us I guess it would be any tattoos that you got on a whim.

No I mean I do have two tattoos but nothing too crazy.

Any speeding tickets or crazy purchases.

No I don’t think I have any speeding tickets. Purchases … no not really.
So I guess not … not for this aspect anyways.

What do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?

Oo... I would say just the grind. It didn’t really matter what Phase you
were in either. So like First Phase obviously you’re getting beaten down
just with the physical and metnal aspect of it but then even when that
day is done you know that day will end you have to go back and clean all
your gear for the next day and wake up super early and you know that
even though you are sore and tired you have to willingly wake up and
face these instructors that you know will destroy you again. So I think
it’s just that constant wake up, get destroyed, go to sleep, sore,
tired, wake up, and then it’s the same thing in Second Phase with
disciplinary actions so you’re still getting wet and sandy so even
though you made it past all that stuff in First Phase you think it would
start to get easier but it doesn’t. And now you’re diving so you still
have all that stuff but now you’re exhausted from diving. And then the
island obviously you’re out working every single day and even the
weekends you’re still waking up super early. So I guess its just the
mental grind.

So how do you get through that?

Uh practice maybe I guess it depends on growing up or how you grew up so
maybe people who weren’t exposed to sports or weren’t exposed to that
grinding aspect … I don’t know.

Is there anything that you did growing up that you think prepared you?

I mean I just worked my ass off every single day … and I mean I didn’t
have someone there so no one made me do it so I guess just the willing
to do it myself and I guess just like the I can do it myself. You know
with sports the coaches make you do it but it’s that off time I think
that’s where you make your money.

Did you feel like you were supported by the group here?

I think everyone is pretty much on the same page I mean you definitely
have your outcasts but I don’t think those people are here anymore and I
couldn’t tell you why they’re outcasts but pretty much everyone here is
similar I mean we’re all meatheads in the gym and we’re all pretty
stubborn when it comes to being told you’re not doing something so at
first I was a little nervous about that thinking there may be too many
cooks in the kitchen but I think it was the complete opposite you know
because I think everyone is so willing to help everyone out because
we’re all so similar minded and we all have the same goals and it’s not
like I want to be here and have to compete against you it’s more like
we’re all here so let’s help each other out and make each other better
and see how great we can become as a team?

What about any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that helped you
push through here?

Um… like religious factors?

Yeah if any at all.

I would say my number one go to whenever it got tough was dad. That was
number one every single time, no doubt that was on my mind.

Was there anytime you had to make a difficult decision, moral or ethical
whether it was personal or watching someone else?

Myself no but one of my good buddies did DOR during Hell Week and we met
in boot camp and they just kind of stole my best friend. But we had to
have a tough conversation in the middle of Hell Week during chow you
know me trying to convince him to not but then his reasons why and just
watch him ring the bell after and just that image and he talked about
those few months during boot camp and seeing that image that just wasn’t
very fun. But other than that no I don’t think that any of my decisions
were that tough.

So was that a conversation that you had to have with him and say that
wasn’t a good decision?

Yeah but other than that I don’t think I really had any of those tough
decisions … none that I remember.

Why do you think that you were successful in completing BUD/S?

Um I guess what I said before just the stubbornness you know the grind
from everything just being able to handle that and not get distressed
because people are yelling or anything like that so yeah I think just
the constant grind and being able to handle that.

Anything different about the people that made it compared to those that
quit?

Antying different… I mean I guess all the people that DOR they all had a
different personality than these guys a less humble factor. All of these
guys when you talk to them … well I guess you are making them talk about
themselves but when you don’t when people aren’t they usually don’t and
I think that that humbleness because all of those people that DOR they
were all talking about how great they are and they were talking about
how they can’t wait to do this next evolution even though everyone knows
that evolution sucks so I guess just a different attitude towards
things.
How has this experience changed you as a person?

Um I mean… I still think I’m still the same person that I was … I mean
any mental aspect or … I don’t think that … no I don’t think that it
really has changed me much I think I’m still the same person that I was
in every aspect.

Anything else that you think I should have asked to help our study?

No not that I can think of.
Ok well then thank you I’m all done with you, congratulations.

Thank you.

WHAT TIME IS IT?

UHH 45

OK I AM JUST GOING TO ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND YOU CAN ANSWER
THEM, YOU KNOW, AS WELL AS YOU CAN. UMM, WHEN DID YOU START BUDS?

UHH, I REPORTED TO BUDS IN MARCH OF 2019 AND I FINALLY GOT INTO A CLASS
IN JUNE. SO, AS OS WE ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE AN INTERIM BEFORE WE START
BEFORE ACTUALLY GETTING INTO A CLASS OF JUNE 2019.

UHH, IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUDS CLASS?

OK, IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUDS EXPERIENCE? YEAH, I GOT ROLLED FROM MY FIRST
CLASS, BUT YEAH, I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

 (SIO): HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

3, 2 SISTERS AND A BROTHER

 WHAT, UHH, WHAT’S THE ORDER?

UHH. THE OLDEST IS MY SISTER TEAGAN, THEN MYSELF, THEN MY YOUNGER SISTER
SIRI, AND THE YOUNGEST IS MY LITTLE BROTHER CYRUS.

UHH, WHAT WAS YOUR PARENTAL SITUATION GROWING UP?

MEANING?

2 PARENTS, 1 PARENT?

UMM, I HAD TWO PARENTS, THEY WERE NEVER TOGETHER THEIR WHOLE LIFE
THOUGH. SO I HAD LIKE A STEP MOM WITH MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER HAD
SEVERAL BOYFRIENDS AS I GREW UP.

SO YOU HAD A DAD, AND A STEPMOM, AND A MOM, AND PARTNERS.

YES

SO, WERE YOUR PARENTS DIVORCED?

THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED.

THEY WERE NEVER MARRIED.

YEP.OH, AND MY LITTLE BROTHER AND LITTLE SISTER ARE HALF BROTHER WITH MY
FATHER AND MY STEP MOM.

YOUR LITTLE BROTHER AND YOUR LITTLE SISTER?

YES.

WHAT’S YOUR RELATIONSHIP… WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PARENTS?

YEAH, SO, THEY WERE, MY WHOLE LIFE THEY WERE VERY AMICABLE. SO, UMM,
THERE WERE TIMES THAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS STRESS, ON UHH, STRESS ON
MYSELF AND MY OLDER SISTER. BUT, THAT WAS, MORE OFTEN IT WAS NOT THE
CASE. I MEAN, WE WOULD LIKE TO CHRISTMAS AND STUFF TOGETHER, SO.

 WHAT IS THE GENDER OF EACH SIBLING? (ALIGN WITH BIRTH ORDER)

 SO, WHAT LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCES HAVE HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE
    PRIOR TO BUDS?

UMM, WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THE MOST RECENT. I WOULD SAY, AFTER COLLEGE
I MOVED TO NEW YORK, CITY, UMM, I HAD TO NAVIGATE THAT. THAT WAS HUGE
CONFIDENCE BUILDING EXERCISE I WOULD SAY. UMM, AND ALSO, I GREW UP IN A
FARM TOWN, VERY SMALL, AND WHEN I MOVED TO COLLEGE, KINDA SEEING LARGER
TOWNS, LIKE STOP LIGHTS AND STUFF. THAT WAS, UHH, THAT WAS VERY
INTERESTING. UHH, YEAH, I GUESS, UHH, I WRESTLED MY WHOLE LIFE, SO THAT
HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON MY WHOLE LIFE, AND HOW I DO THINGS, HOW I APPROACH
THINGS.

WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?

MICHIGAN

MICHIGAN. SO, HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT,
MOVING TO NEW YORK, GROWING UP IN A FARM TOWN, EVENTUALLY GOING TO
COLLEGE IN A LARGER CITY

ANN ARBOR, YEAH

 OH, YOU WENT TO MICHIGAN, OK. UMM, HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE
    EVENTS FACTORED INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUDS?

A LOT OF THOSE ARE LIKE CONFIDENCE BUILDING, THE ONES THAT I CHOSE TO
SHARE WITH YOU, ARE CONFIDENCE BUILDING UMM EXPERIENCES. SO YOU KNOW I
CAME HERE KNOWING THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAD THIS, YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO
QUESTION THAT WHETHER, WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I KNEW
THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS
IN MY PATH. FINDING MY OWN WAY HERE, YOU KNOW THAT REALLY HELPED. THERE
WAS NO UNCERTAINTY IN MY MIND WHEN I GOT HERE. IT WAS IMPACTED ME WAS
THAT I KNEW I WAS GOING TO DO THE WORK THAT I HAD TO GET DONE. SO YOU
KNOW...

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUDS?

I THINK WELL, YOU KNOW, I CONSISTENTLY DO WELL ON LIKE PEER EVALS AND
THEY WAY THAT I CAN BUILD RELATIONSHIPS HERE. THAT JUST GOES A LOT
FARTHER THAN WHAT PEOPLE THINK. IF YOU ARE KINDA GOING AT THIS ALONE, IT
IS GOING TO BE MUCH HARDER VERSUS JUST LIKE BEING ABLE TO BUILD BONDS
WITH GUYS EARLY ON AND UMM, I THINK MY PERSONALITY, NOT JUST WORK ETHIC
ALONE, PERSONALITY DEFINITELY PLAYS INTO THAT, JUST BEING UHH, ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE WELL WITH OTHERS.

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LEAD YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING PART
    OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY. SO, WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS, DO YOU HAVE
    ANY SEALS AS FAMILY OR FRIENDS? UHH, OR ANY MILITARY FAMILY OR
    FRIENDS?

UHH, SO NO FAMILY, BUT UMM, I WRESTLED AT MICHIGAN AND I WAS INTERESTED
IN GOING INTO THE CIA. DURING ALUMNI WEEKEND, THERE WAS A FORMER
MICHIGAN WRESTLER WHO IS A SEAL TEAM 6 OFFICER, I THINK IN TOWN, I
WANTED TO MEET WITH HIM, TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET INTO INTELLIGENCE WORK OR
WHATEVER. WE ENDED UP JUST KIND OF TALKING ABOUT HIS CAREER AND UHH, AND
YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE TEAMS. AND UMM, YEAH FROM THERE, HE HAS
BEEN MY MENTOR, AND I WOULD, I WOULD SAY THAT IS THE ONE PERSON WHO HAS
INFLUENCED MY DECISION THEN.

 SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, UMM, HOW WERE
    DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? SPANKING? TIMEOUTS?

OH YEAH, MY MOM, I’D GET, I’D GET, MY MOM WAS PRETTY HARD ON ME. BUT YOU
KNOW, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT OUT OF LIKE, IMMATURITY OR
WHATEVER, OR LIKE HER. I THINK SHE HAD A WAY THAT SHE WANTED US TO
BEHAVE AND WHEN WE DIDN’T SHE WOULD COME DOWN ON US HARD.

FATHER?

UHH, MY DAD WAS, I - I DON’T KNOW, NOT THAT HE DIDN’T RESPECT MY MOM, I
JUST THINK THAT MY DAD, YOU KNOW, WOULD TELL ME TO DO SOMETHING AND I
WAS LIKE, OK, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO NEED TO BUMP UP AGAINST HIM. UMM, YOU
KNOW, I MEAN HE NEVER REALLY, HIT ME OR MY SISTER.

FOR ME IT WAS ALWAYS, JUST WAIT TILL YOUR DAD GETS HOME.

OH YEAH, SO I AM LUCKY THAT HE WAS A LOT MORE CALM THEN MY MOM. SHE
WOULD JUST FLY OFF.

 YEAH, HUH, MINE TOO. DID YOU MOVE, UHH, AROUND THROUGHOUT YOUR
    CHILDHOOD OR TEENAGE YEARS?

I MEAN WE, UHH, WE ALWAYS LIVE IN THE SAME … WE MOVED HOUSES OR
WHATEVER, BUT WE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE SAME SMALL TOWN OR THE SURROUNDING
FARMLANDS OF THAT TOWN I’D SAY.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A TEAM SPORT?
WRESTLING?

MY WHOLE LIFE, SINCE I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. UHH YOU KNOW, THROUGH COLLEGE,
AND THEN YOU KNOW I ALSO PLAYED FOOTBALL, BUT YOU KNOW, I WAS NOT VERY
UHH. I DIDN’T FIND ANY SUCCESS IN FOOTBALL.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE (PRIOR TO
    BUD/S TRAINING)? WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR
    EXAMPLE, DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

LET’S CHECK THEM TIME HERE. YOU KNOW WE ARE SUPPOSED TO KEEP IT TO 15
MINUTES. YOU KNOW I PLAYED FOOTBALL UNTIL EVERYBODY SPROUTED ABOVE ME.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS PRIOR TO BUDS?

UMM, I WAS WORKING IN MANHATTAN. FINANCE JOB, AND THEN I SPENT A YEAR IN
MICHIGAN AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. LET’S SEE, IT'S 2020, I GUESS I WOULD
HAVE JUST BEEN FINISHING UP COLLEGE FIVE YEARS AGO.

SO THEN YOU JOINED THE NAVY AFTER UHH

I’M SORRY?

YOU JOINED THE NAVY AFTER THEN OR?

SO, I - I WAS BACKTRACKING, I GRADUATED COLLEGE, WORKED AS A FINANCIAL
ADVISOR IN MICHIGAN, AND THEN WORKED FOR THREE YEARS IN MANHATTAN, AND
THEN JOINED THE NAVY. SORRY, I DID THAT KIND OF BACKWARDS.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UMMM, NO.

EXAMPLE THAT THEY ASK IS HERE IS UHH, WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS.

NO, BUT UHH, I MEAN I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TATTOOS AND THEY
THOUGHT A LONG TIME ABOUT IT.

SO YOU DON’T HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

I DON’T HAVE ANY TATTOOS

YOU KNOW, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING ONE FOR 20 YEARS. ALMOST GOT ONE
WHEN I FINISHED BASIC TRAINING IN THE ARMY. GLAD I DIDN’T. WHAT WAS THE
MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUDS?

UMMM, I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE JUST LIKE THE STRESS OF LIKE IF YOU MESS
SOMETHING UP, THEY’LL YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET SENT AWAY FOR MAKING LIKE A
SMALL MISTAKE.

 WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

UMM, I THINK IT WAS JUST LIKE I MADE MY DECISION THAT I WAS GOING TO
FINISH IT BEFORE I GOT HERE AND THERE WAS LIKE, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT
WAS GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND.

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
    QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S)

   WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH? DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE
        SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

   WHAT PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL) DID YOU
        UTILIZE TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

UMM, WELL, PHYSICAL, I LIKE THINK ITS JUST GRIT AND UMM, YEAH THERE IS
NO LIKE MANTRAS OR SECRETS OR ANYTHING. YOU JUST DEAL WITH THE PAIN AND
COMPARTMENTALIZE IT UHH AS BEST YOU CAN AND UHH I THINK THAT’S LIKE, SO
THE COMPARTMENTALIZING OF THE LIKE, THE UHH, TASKS AHEAD. I GOT PRETTY
GOOD FROM WRESTLING, JUST HAVING TO CUT WEIGHT AND KIND OF WORK THROUGH
A WHOLE SEASON, SO UMM, I’D SAY THOSE WERE THE BIGGEST ONES I USED.

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
    WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION?

YEAH, SO, UHH, WHEN I MADE DIFFICULT DECISIONS, I WOULD THINK ABOUT HOW
IT WOULD AFFECT THE GROUP OF GUYS AROUND ME AND NOT JUST LIKE
IMMEDIATELY BUT LIKE MOVING FORWARD. UMM, FOR INSTANCE, I GUY MADE A
MISTAKE, DOES IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO GO TELL THE INSTRUCTOR STAFF AND
KIND OF LOSE THE RESPECT AND TRUST OF THE CLASS AS A WHOLE? JUST GIVEN
THAT SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. NOT MANY DIFFICULT
DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE IN BUDS THOUGH, IT IS ALL PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHT
FORWARD AND EASY.

 CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE?

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

UMM, I JUST DIDN’T GIVE MYSELF ANY OTHER OPTION. LIKE, PEOPLE WOULD ASK
ME WHAT MY PLAN B IS AND LIKE THERE IS NO, THIS IS THE ONLY PLAN I HAVE
RIGHT NOW. ITS KINDA LIKE, SO I GOT ROLLED, AND THEN I ALMOST FAILED
ANOTHER POOL EVOLUTION AND I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF, IF I GET
DROPPED, IT WOULD BE SO MUCH WORSE THAN DYING. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE LIKE
THE END OF, I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHERE MY LIFE WOULD GO AFTER THAT.

SO I JUST THINK THAT LIKE CONVINCING YOURSELF THAT LIKE NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH, GIVING YOURSELF NO OTHER
OPTION, UMM, THAT'S WHY I THINK I DID WELL HERE.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE
    IT? IF SO, CAN YOU DESCRIBE THOSE DIFFERENCES?

NOPE

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON?

IT HASN’T. YEAH, SO UMM, I DO THINK THAT UHH, LIKE, KIND OF TOUCHED ON
FAMILY LIFE, AND I GREW UP IN A VERY UNSTABLE HOME. UMM, I MEAN, UHH,
BOTH PARENTS WERE FELONS. THERE WAS DRUG ABUSE IN ALL MY FAMILY AROUND
TOO. SO I THINK THAT THAT INDEPENDENCE THAT I HAD AT A VERY YOUNG AGE
CERTAINLY HELPED ME GET THROUGH UMM. AND LIKE THE STUDIES ABOUT GRIT AND
HEARINESS, I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING THAT SINCE I WAS A VERY YOUNG CHILD.
SO, UHH, THOSE, I WOULD SAY THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING. FROM LIKE A YOUNG
AGE, HAVING TO DEAL WITH, YOU KNOW, BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE AROUND
ME MAKING BAD DECISIONS AND CUTTING MY OWN PATH WAS THE BIGGEST FACTOR
OF WHY I AM HERE.

AND WHAT’S YOUR PARTICIPANT ID, THE NUMBER

YOU THINK WE SHOULD COVER

NOT REALLY

I’M GONNA HIT STOP

OK

Number 13 okay great. So, is this your uhm when did you
start BUDS and is this your first experience?

I started with class 338 and uhm that was back around July
and then got rolled after during Hell Week. And 339 now. First time at
BUD/s.

And how just a (lil) little (abouke) about your background,
how many siblings do you have and are they older younger boys girls?

I have one older brother.

Okay, were your parents married separated or divorced?

Married.

And what was your relationship, what is your relationship
with them?

I have a great relationship with my parents and brother.

Great. And what life changing events happened to you prior
to BUD/S? And what life changing means is anything you think it means,
it could be nothing it could be ya had one thing it could be ya had
three things?

Uhm, I don’t know. I wouldn’t say I had any like major
events that were super life changing it was more of uh just kind of a
gradual …

Okay, yeah.

shift in who I developed to be.

Great, uhm. How do you think your personality contributed
to your success in BUD/S?

Uh, I think, helped me just like more of a serious guy, uhm
kept things professional when I need to, but I was just kinda able to
keep some perspective and laugh about things at times. It kinda worked
as a balance for me.

And then tell me about your background that even wanted,
that made you wanna be a SEAL. Like did you have anybody that you knew
that was a seal? Was your family military? Did you read a book?

Uh, I actually met CDR Ledford at college, uh he was
getting his PHD when I was

there as an undergrad.

At Princeton?

Yes.

Okay.

And then, he was like the first person I ever talked to
about uhm being a SEAL. I, I had like that idea of military, like some
special operations, wasn’t sure. And he just kinda put a face to it and
then that just slowly developed while I was in college. And then
afterwards, uhm, decided to come out here and pursue this.

Okay, so tell me about, a little bit about your childhood
like how were you disciplined? Like did your parents spank you, make you
run, or do pushups or withhold toys or timeouts? What?

Yeah the, the, or they’re biggest way would be to just take
things away from us...

Okay.

Or just kinda, I, I was I wasn’t a super rebellious kid by
any means. Uh, my older brother kinda took the brunt of that, so I just
sat back and…

I had that too.

Saw that. (laughs)

And did you move around in, in college or in high school?
Sorry, ...

No

In your teenage years?

No, I grew up in New Jersey and stayed there all the way
through college, so comin’ out here was the first time I left.

Wow, okay. And then tell me about your teenage years. Did
you ha, were you on a team sport in...

Yep.

high school, college?

Yeah so I played soccer in high scool and college. So,
basically grew up playing sports and was always, always playin’.

So what position do you play in soccer?

Changed a lot, I ended as a forward.

Okay.

Uhm, that’s where like I finished played, but played
defense my first couple years so.

Were you recruited?

Uh, yes.

I’m just interested my son plays soccer.

Yeah so

So (laughing) It’s definitely all consuming. What’s your
favorite team and you premier league guy or do you follow.

Yeah, I like liverpool.

Tis.

I definitely haven’t been able to follow it much since

Of course.

Since the past year so.

They’re doing very well.

Yeah.

If ya haven’t seen it.

I haven’t (laughing), no.

He’s a liverpool fan, he plays for liverpool America.

Oh yeah?

And he’s obsessed with it. So they’re way ahead in the
premier league, but that’s way off track.

Yeah (laughing).

So sorry (laughing). So, what have you done in the last
five years of your life prior to BUD/S? Just went to college?

I was in ...

or did you?

Yeah, so I was in college and then put in the uh officer
candidate school package. So that is like a year long process in itself
to come out here. There’s a screener, so after college I put in my
application and I coached for a year while I was going through this
process to come out here.

At what level?

Uh, it was a youth club, so we were, we had teams between
like U-10 and U-18.

Okay, would you consider yourself impulsive? Like, do you
have any tattoos or do you make?

Definitely not.

Okay. And then what? Think about the most challenging day
that you’ve had at BUD/S or your hardest thing? What motivated you to
push through and did you feel like you were supported by your team?

Definitely supported by the team. Uhm, everybody’s gonna
have their, their days. I wouldn’t say one that stands out to me too
much, but just like I, I have a lot of memories and just like the guys
keeping you like in your perspective and just realizing where you are
and being lucky to have such great people around you.

So what was the hardest day? Or what are you thinking of?

Uhm.

Like Hell Week?

Yeah, Hell Week’s just, just a grind. There’s nothing that
stands out as like this one thing was impossible.

Okay.

But you just have your, your moments that are just like you
just kinda get through em.

And what practices did you have to help your push through
the challenges? Like emotional, spiritual, mental?

Uh.

Did you, can you think of anything?

It was just, just like a men, a mentality to just keep
going knowing that everything is going to end eventually. Uhm,
definitely seeing like just going through whatever we’re doing just take
care of that one step at a time.

That’s helpful. So did you have any difficult decisions
that you had to make at BUD/S? Like, uhm, running classmates out,
turning in someone who’s cheating? And if you did, what does, did you
struggle with that and what helped you get over that? And if you didn’t
that’s fine too.

Yeah we definitely had a couple decisions like that. Uh, in
terms of class leadership amongst the officers and the senior enlisted
guys we have. Uhm, and they always turned into, it wasn’t just me making
the decision or just our OIC making the decision it was always like a
group discussion about it, uhm, amongst those that have the leadership
roles and we always talked it through, so.

Can you give me an example?

Uhm, so one example is just a guy breaking curfew on our
first weekend.

Mhm.

Like going out drinking and comes back and he’s, he’s the
only guy that comes back late. So, talked about it with the class to
decide are you gonna turn him into the staff or are you gonna handle it
within the class. I’ve had a few, a few things like that come up.

Yep, no, sure. Uhm, What did you think about specifically
when you made that decision? I’m not talking about the group, I’m
talking about you personally, like, did you think about, uhm, what that
would do to him? The consequences or did you think about you as a team?

Uh, you definitely have to. We thought about both fors, uh,
I thought about both forsure. Cause if, if you turn this one guy in it’s
likely that you’re gonna put him in a really bad spot where if he has a
history of other mistakes he’s gonna get dropped from the program
likely. So, you definitely take that into consideration. But, uhm, what
we kind of saw as the more important thing is what, what the rest of the
class is doing and the guys who are doing the right thing. You need to
be able to stand up for the guys who are gonna do the right thing and,
and get rid of the people who are gonna be toxic to the class.

Mhm.

So.

Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?

Uhm, (laughing), I don’t know. It’s, it’s a tough question.

Well let me ask it this way, what do you think is different
about the people who didn’t make it?

(Unintelligible)I don’t know, maybe they just lost sight of
what they were here for. Uhm. Personally, like it was, it was a huge
decision for me to come out here and like my decision was made before I
was out here, so. It (unintelligible), it’s just kinda like a simple way
of explaining it, but that was really just how I felt about it.

Mhm. How do you think this whole decision changed you as a
person?

Like to come out here or?

The BUD/S experience.

It’s definitely given me great perspective on different
people, uhm. Just, a lot of different experiences that you go through. I
think the, one of the bigger lessons that I’ve learned though is to
just, you never know who, who you’re dealing with and kind of the deeper
levels of, of people and getting to know them better and giving guys a
second chance and being surprised who they, who they are who you thought
they were.

So the Army, er the Army, I’m Army, the Navy has asked us
to come in and do this to try to figure out before people get here what
makes someone successful at BUD/s?

Right.

Is there anything that I shoulda asked you that would help
us in this research endeavor? No?

I don’t know (Laughing). I guess that’s why you’re doing
this today, right?

(Laughing) kay. Well sometimes, yeah, sometimes people will
say yeah well I’ve noticed ya know that all the impulsive people quit or
whatever. Is there anything you think we missed and that we should’ve
asked? Like, oh if you ask this question that’ll separate the people who
make it.

No. I, I’ve just tried, I’ve just kinda realized that I
have no idea who’s, who’s gonna be, you never know who’s not gonna make
it, but I think there are some guys that just you can probably bet on by
being like well-thought out and like, yeah I guess less impulsive
(unintelligible) the guys that had to invest a lot more to get out here.

Okay.

That seems to be, uh, the ones who are just still here.

Okay thank you.

So, the recorders are on, can I record this interview?

Yes

This is participant 130. Sit really close, so I can catch
your voice. Easy questions first, how many siblings do you have?

I have two.

Two siblings. And what's the birth order, like where do you
fall?

I’m middle.

And what are the, what’s the gender of your siblings?

Male

All males?

Yeah

Your poor parents.

Yeah my poor mom.

Um so if you think about your life experiences what might
you describe as kinda your crucible or life shaping experiences other
than birth?

Uhmm, like as far as family goes or specific things that happened
to me?

Anything, yeah.

Uhh, I played football in highschool, kinda opened me up to uhh
the military kinda taught me what it meant to be a good teammate be-be
tough uhh had a really good coaching that kind of set the foundation for
me. Uhh leaving, leaving home and then going to the academy so kinda
just being on my own I guess. I didn’t know anyone when I went there and
didn’t like...I had no military family so it was all very new to me.

Yeah

Um, I guess having to make that adjustment.Umm, yeah.

So um, anything like that was like kind of super monumental
in your childhood umm that just I don’t know kinda changed the
trajectory of your life at all

Umm, honestly I think I did this project in like the 6th grade um
interviewed my grandparents about World War II and I kinda got hooked on
the idea and-and I told myself that I would look I‘d never close any
doors even like throughout highschool um so I'm not gonna close doors,
I'm gonna figure out what I want to do and kinda run with it and um
nothing really came to mind um like any other profession that I wanted
to do even when I was a kid I wanted to be a baseball player but like
every kid wants to be an astronaut or firefighter, or something-

Yeah

- so I didn’t think that was really significant but I-I-I think
kinda getting that sense of patriotism or learning a lot from my
grandparents at that time kinda what it meant to get through hard times
and stuff um yeah that kind of inspired me.

Now had they both been in WWII?

So my grandfather served on Okinawa uh he went after the campaign
like he was kind of an occupying force but umm I don’t know that was
just fascinating my grandmother was at home and just kind of gutting out
the time.

Yeah, um how do you think those experiences maybe factored
into your experiences here at BUD/s?

Umm, you have to be flexible you have to be like willing to adjust
to things-

Yeah

-and if you can’t then you’re kind of gunna go crazy and I think
throughout my life like whether it was-usually it was a new school but
um I didn't know anybody there and I always had to figure things out on
my own and kind of make things for myself I guess umm

Did you move around a lot as a child?

No, it was just um I think like 3rd grade to 4th grade went to a
new school didn't know anybody um restarting like making friends going
into highschool didn’t know anyone had to make friends going into the
academy didn't know anybody um honestly like this was kind of the first
place where like I knew people going into it which is weird that it
would be here but um I knew a lot of people that were coming into this
pipeline and um yeah I think being able to- to kind of be flexible and
adjust like I said is kind of what helped me be successful.

Yeah, um how would you describe your personality and how do
you think your personality contributed to you getting through BUD/s?

Umm, I think …I’m laid back um but when I need to get something
done I can- I can be super focused and um I guess the laid back nature
allows me to decompress after having these extensive um intense focus
umm yeah um

Um do you consider yourself kind of a calm person?

Calm?

A calm person.

Yeah, I would.

Have you always been that way?

Yes, yeah

Um, describe kind of your background that led you to want
to join the seal community.

Uhh, so my uncle in 2005 came back from Afghanistan and he was
shot 8 times and um just in a real weird spot medically and was done
with the military and umm didn't really know him before because he was
gone and then got to know that he was in Army SF and when I was in
highschool kinda got interested in the military more as far as making it
a profession and uh I went to him and-and-and he exposed me to the SOF
community, he told me about the SEALs , his experience with them and um
I kinda from there was just like yeah I’m gonna go for this thing.

Um, what about your early childhood so kind of
pre-highschool years what was that like?

Yeah, so I-I played baseball and basketball um my dad really...my
uh I think my dad worked really hard growing up. He-he had a rough
upbringing and um kind of instilled like some discipline in me and my
cousin at the time my uh- he was playing baseball he ended up getting
drafted into the MLB and tore his ACL and-and-and you know that fizzled
out but like was on track to be something special and um when he was in
highschool he was like doing these crazy workouts in my mind at the time
they were like these crazy workouts to be stronger and everything and at
a very young age I started training myself and I dont think its
necessarily anything that developed me later on uh physically perse but
the discipline that I started I guess at an early age I think made it
easier to continue that kind of life um as I got older just became like
a new normal um because I know like my teachers I was like kind of a
weird kid I guess in that sense because I wanted to be good at baseball
but I’m also this like fourth grader and my teachers like asked my
parents why I was doing pushups and situps at recess while the other
kids are like playing and looking back on it yeah thats incredibly
weird-

Yeah, yeah

-um but I guess it was just something I did because I wanted to be
at that level he was at for whatever reason I just thought it was
special.

What did uh your parents parenting style what was that
like?

Umm fair. Umm very loving but um (long pause). They were very
serious all the time because they were working, they were working all
the time and they didn't really have time it felt like to for them to I
guess do much with us. They didnt do a lot with us.

Yeah

Um yeah I guess one-if-maybe-like my earliest memories are like if
I’m-if I was interacting with my parents like I was getting in trouble.
Yeah-yeah um me and my brothers just like-.

Yeah. Um so, what about just how what was their discipline
approach? Did they spank you, did you have timeouts? Um, did they take
away toys?

Yeah it was-it was um physical discipline. It was- they would
ground us I guess it was more physical than the uh, the than like the
other stuff I guess-

Yeah

-but it wasn't anything that was like too aggressive or something
that's like worth fighting

Yeah. What about teenage years? Um well I may have asked
this before but did you move around at all in your childhood?

Um we spent a couple years um at my grandparents house because
our-we were getting our house worked on we decided to renovate it
instead of move out to the suburbs and uh so we stayed out there at
their house for a couple years um and that was interesting just being in
a different neighborhood but that was the only moving I'd ever done.

Where-where are you-

Chicago.

Chicago, okay. The city?

Yes.

Uh, what about sports? Did you participate in sports in your
teenage years, if so what sports?

So I got to highschool I did uh basketball, swimming, and football.

Okay. Um any other like team activities, not necessarily
sports, but something as a group?

Mm, no. Football dominated my life. That was-that was everything
so I guess that, I didn't really have anything outside of it.

Was anything else notable from your teenage years? I don't
know was kinda formative in that time frame?

No really it was- it was honestly just um like I had this interest
in the military from my uncle and then the football like thing my
coaches saw something in me um they thought I had a lot of potential as-
as far as uhh taking a role in leading the team and um they half of them
had a military background the others were like college athle- or they
played football in college um some at D1 schools and that immersion,
kinda like the discipline and and being that super athlete I think kinda
it was like really good timing both learning about the stuff with my
uncle and then and then being on this-on this team. But it was more
about like “are you a good teammate are you gonna be like a good man,
are you gonna do all these things, and um it was more- it wasn't as much
of like are you gonna perform on the field like that was very important
but the most important stuff was you know how you are as a man, how are
you developing as a person um yeah can you be a good teammate.

What about your last 5 years leading up to BUD/s, what were
they like? You said academy but did you go somewhere after that or
straight here?

Uh so I went to the prep school in rhode island for a year and then
I went to the academy for the next four.

Did you (indiscernible) at the academy?

No so I didn't do anything. Um I spent a couple years skydiving um
with the parachute team. I trained really hard to be on the triathlon
team that was something that I guess is notable is I trained super hard
um to be on the triathlon team and failed both times and kinda had this
moment when um I was at the academy you know I was like you want to be a
SEAL um and I- and I knew being on that team was going to push me in
that direction as far as like being -being the athlete that I wanted to
be and I was like “man if you can’t like make this team you know I kinda
had this moment of doubt um and it crushed me because I had never
trained for anything like that hard and I just kinda flipped a switch I
was just like lets keep pushing and see this thing through. And then it
brought me into skydiving and doing other stuff.

Um would you consider yourself impulsive at all?

Yes

And could you describe something that involves impulsive
behavior?

Sure, uh, so skydiving is kinda the first one. Uhhh, getting a
motorcycle was another one. Umm, my first tattoo was on impulse.

How many tattoos do you have?

Eight.

Wow, that’s a lot.

Yeah

So were they all impulsive like tattoos?

No no, it kind of developed from like wha-like an interest in it
kinda like honestly with everything else, I kinda had an interest in it
and then I got deeper into it whether it was jumping or building up to
like my own bike or -

Yeah

-kinda the artistic aspects to a tattoo

Yeah

more so than kind of the tough guy kind of approach to it um.
Ummm, yeah I guess probably just like small insignificant things I can
do on impulse but nothing that's like gonna take me off a straight path
like I'm going to do anything bad. I never feel like it's
uncontrollable.

What about um any like speeding tickets or-

No. Yeah, no I’ve never gotten a ticket.

What about what motivates you on a daily basis?

I think it's a combination of purpose and excitement

Yeah

Um like I want to feel something I wanna feel like uh yeah I'm
getting something out of what I'm doing.

Yeah

But then also know I'm doing it for the right reason?

And now kind of talking specifically about BUD/s if you
think about the most challenging component whether its a specific day or
event at BUD/s what was that?

My-my hardest day was I got SIPE for the second time and it was
way worse than I had had it before. And um I started throwing up blood
on the beach and I finished the evolution and we were like laying on the
surf and coughing up blood and then um we were about to go into a boat
race and we were getting into the height line and guys were telling me
“dude you have to go to medical like you can't keep going and um it
kinda felt like a tightrope quit I guess in a way-

Yeah

-because I wanted to stay but at the same time like I didn't want
to get guys hurt-

Yeah

-and it felt like a pretty big like moment of defeat for me and
then of course like getting made fun of by instructors

Yeah yeah

I think I ended up having like 80-82 percent - my O2 levels at 82
percent at the time and I was able to come back from it after the
weekend but um that was a moment where I was like wow like this is the
worst thing I've ever felt um and then the uh yeah another one would’ve
been like getting rolled my-my first time getting like emotionally or
not emotional - just getting invested in the class and then-and then
getting rolled from it that was tough. But definitely the - the throwing
up blood was like the shock factor of it like happening and then um the
stuff that I explained.

So what um what helped you push through that?

I don’t know. Yeah, I don't know just maybe its like a full
retard, I don’t-

Is there a group dynamic that you think helps with
(indiscernible)

Oh for sure yeah, no I mean uh even though like BUD/s has been the
hardest thing I’ve ever done its been I think it's absolutely hilarious
like it’s the - I’ve laughed so hard um going through every phase of
training and I think that helps like with it a lot. Especially with the
last class that I was in like going between the three classes it's just
like every day was hilarious. Every day was hard but the-the camaraderie
like just the boys made it, sweet. Made it a lot of fun.

(Indiscernible) physical mental spiritual to get through
BUD/s?

Uhh, spiritual Im catholic um so theres that. Mental umm yeah just
gut it out. There wasn’t like a specific thing I would think about. I
wanted to do it for my family. Thought about my family a lot.

When you say family is that like parents?

Yeah, yeah my parents, my brothers. Like I-I wanted to make them
proud.

When you had to make a difficult decision during training
at BUD/s, uh what went through your mind when you had to make that
decision? Can you give an example of -

Um, yeah we uh we had this guy in uh first phase who like cheated
on the o-course and everyone really liked him and stuff and we had it
was like right before our hell week party like everyones secured hell
week we’re gonna go have pizza and drink beers and we were about to tell
this guy like “hey we're telling the instructors that you cheated you're
gonna get kicked out right and like essentially um and it was gonna
affect the class because everyone was gonna find out and stuff so tried
to handle it super carefully. And there was like this part that was like
guys are coming up to me and like “this thing happened” like they saw it
and they didn’t really want something to happen.

Yeah

But like they had to address it and I was like thinking like do we
do something do we not do something, and then I was like you know if
everyon-if this bothers people then like how can you not address this
thing. It's not an insignificant thing that happened y’know especially
in BUD/s y’know for someone to cheat something is like a moral sin.
Nowadays, I don't think it was before but now guys will just like dude
thats not okay and um at this point in my career its like getting in a
room with some guys and deciding what to do like hey we are going to
turn this guy in if he doesn’t um that was that was tough. For someone
who’d gone to BUD/s before, had to come back, and then he was in the
spot like that sucked.

Um, why do you think you were successful at BUD/s?

Uh, I think building relationships with guys. Yeah. its I mean
yeah it's (indiscernible). Yeah I felt like I surrounded myself with
really good people not to like carry me through but everyone would
always work together and would work well and I tried to I tried my best
to uh to kind of foster that environment whenever I ended up being in
charge of and um I had a lot of fun doing it at the same time.

What about, did you notice anything different about the
people that you (indiscernible)

In-In-

(indiscernible)

Um, no because I di-I didn’t. Just kinda like people are there and
then they’re not.

Yeah

No matter what the phase like I dont think people ju- at least I
never put that much thought into it cus you kinda just live like a dog,
you're just in the moment.

Yeah

Um, no matter what level of training youre in. You’re just like
okay whos gone what's the next thing youre gonna worry about.

(too quiet)

I thought that would go away in first phase but it was like second
and third phase too.

(too quiet)

Yeah, yeah

A lot of people said that. How’d this experience change you
as a person?

Uh, definitely found out uh I’m way tougher than I thought I was.
Um, I thought also I was gonna be - I knew I wasn’t as good as the other
O’s physically that I was coming out here with like competing with the
enlisted guys at the evolutions, its incredibly humbling like wow these
guys are studs. Uh and I didnt expect - I knew they were gonna be like
really tough, and like really athletic but I got to a certain point like
look to my left and right and Im like wow these dudes are crushing me
right now and uh it was like super impressive and like I said humbling.

(too quiet)

Okay cool.

Thank you. Congratulations. Thanks for sitting down with me.

OK, can I get your number?

Yes. 133.

133. And is it OK if I record?

Yes.

OK. Great, awesome. I’m gonna start out with something
really easy. How many siblings do you have and what’s the birth order?

I’m the oldest and my brother is a year and a half younger than I
am.

And then, tell me about your life experiences. Do you have
something that you would describe as your crucible or something that was
really life shaping?

Uh, for me, I would have to say, probably uh, I’m Christian, so
giving myself over to Christ has been a huge part of what has gotten me
through.

OK, so how did that impact your life at BUD/S? Or your
experiences?

Well, being that Jesus is my rock, I relied heavily on him as far
as my confidence and my strength. And, I also have a phenomenal family
that is back home supporting me, a wife that has been nothing but
supportive and encouraging, so that all played into *undecipherable*.

And do you think your personality had anything to do with
or contribute to your progression through BUD/S?

Uhm, I would say a little bit, yeah. I am definitely, uhm,
somebody that, you know, I believe that, you know, when given the
opportunity to rise to something that is bigger than you, and the
opportunity has presented itself, then why short sell yourself on that?
You know, there's, I think it's one of those things where the pain, and
the discomfort, and the uh, the inconvenience of the situation, it will
end, so uh, it’s just seeing yourself until the end.

OK, I’m gonna ask you more, don’t worry.

That’s absolutely fine.

So, tell me about your background that led you even to
wanting to become a SEAL?

It’s funny, I actually did not want to be in the military when I
was younger. Uh, I always liked to play with the GI Joes and play you
know soldiers and stuff like that with my brother, with, you know,
plastic guns and stuff like that, but I never really saw myself in the
military. I actually liked art and drawing and all that stuff. I don't
know, I guess I started realizing that I had an aggressive side, I tried
out lacrosse when I was in middle school, then started developing a
desire to be in a sport that was a team competitive kind of thing. I
really enjoyed that. And uh, as time went along, I didn't do well in
college. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life. And I
didn't have purpose in life. And it was hard for me to get excited about
something. You know, I didn't really see what it was. And then I just
kinda started looking into the military through some family friends and
stuff like that. I remember watching the guardian and I thought I wanted
to be a rescue swimmer. I just wanted to help people. I just thought
that was awesome, putting other people’s needs before yourself. And,
uhm, that was kinda what led me into the military to begin with.

OK. So tell me a little about your childhood. Like if you
did something bad, how did your parents discipline you. Like if you did
something bad, did they spank you? Was it time-outs?

No, uh, no yeah we had a switch tree. We planted it there myself.
And I would go pick a switch and go hand it to my mom and yeah, that’s
the way it went.

OK. Uhm, and then what about your teenage years? Did you
stay in lacrosse?

Uhm, so yeah, stayed in lacrosse, but we did move. I grew up in
Kennesaw, Georgia and uh, stayed there until middle school. My dad got
an awesome new job as a nuclear engineer and uh he got a new job
inNorfolk, Virginia. And uh, that was actually the first time I ever
really had any exposure to the military. I never had any exposure to the
military when I was growing up in Georgia.

But isn’t there a, Kennesaw, Georgia, isn’t there a
military college?

But I mean, I had, that’s a little bit further. In uh,
Northeastern Georgia, so I had never really seen it or anything of it.

OK. So with lacrosse you were saying you got a lot out of
the team and you liked the teamwork?

I did. I did.

And then what have you done in the last 5 years of your
life prior to BUD/S that led you to this? So what was your sequence? So
you went to high school, then you went to college?

Yes. Uhm, well it was when I, uhm, started realizing that what the
demands of the job where you would have to put yourself in a situation
that, uh, could threaten your life and is already threatening the lives
of the people around you that I realized the kinda training that was
required would demand a, uncomfortable training method and I started
discipling myself really well. I actually, for a couple years, when I
would work out, I wouldn’t listen to music, uhm because I wanted to see
if I could find the drive within myself instead of being cheerled by
music so I wanted see if I could do the gut check and find out what the
hardest workout I could do to myself and do it without any motivations.

That's very...OK. Do you consider yourself impulsive? Do
you have any tattoos? Do you binge drink?

No, uhm. I do have a tattoo, I wouldn't consider myself impulsive
though. I’m actually the kind of person now, that, you know, if there’s
something that I want I’ll, if I find it online, i'll sit on that item
for a week or more, and if i'm still thinking about it then i'll buy it,
if not, then it wasn't worth the buy.

OK. And then, what motivates you on a daily basis?

Uhm, my faith, uhm, my wife, and uhm, this opportunity in general.
This is a community that should have pride in itself. It’s a clearly,
it’s earned a name, and I bet that's how a lot of guys find out about
it, because it had gotten some of an audience, but they, men coming
together, realizing that everybody has strengths and weaknesses, but
working together to accomplish objectives that other people in the world
will not have the opportunity to do, and they see the dangers that are
represented before them and still stay active. That’s what really drives
me as well.

OK. Think about your hardest day of BUD/S, or your most
challenging thing. What was that?

Uhm, one day that really sticks out in my mind. I struggled with
the O-course when I first got here. I was trying to muscle my way
through, I wasn't trying to use any finesse, or use the way it’s
supposed to be done. Which is, you know, you just can’t muscle through
the O-course. You have to find ways to navigate the technique to get
yourself through and become more efficient. And, uh, I was really slow
on it and I remember I thought I had passed, and thought I had finally
gotten my marker, and I remember being told that I failed by 3 seconds.
My instructor gave me a hard time about it, and then went right to logs.
Logs was one of my least favorite evolutions that we did in the first
phase and uhm, we uh, it was a real kick in the gut, but it was one of
those moments where, I prayed heavily in that moment and had to realize
that there was still a job to be done. I still had to support my buddies
on the log. And, that was definitely a hard moment.

Did you feel like the group supported you in that time?

I think it’s not so much about whether they...I don’t know if
everybody knew whether or not I had failed or not. It was more just, we
all needed each other. The log, the log sucks, and it isn’t gonna move
itself. I had a role to play and, uhm, I needed to do it to the best of
my abilities. If I was slightly out of it, I would have been a detriment
to them, and that would have been bad.

OK. And then what, what practices did you use to push you
through things? Like spiritual, mental, physical?

Sometimes I would try to break up certain things that you know,
use markers for my goal. Whatever I found, you know, if it was a
distance we had to go, OK, kinda found a way to break it up a little
bit. If not, if I wasn’t using the markers, just realizing whether they
were making us do 12 count body builders, I knew there was gonna be a
next thing. Like they’re not just gonna do that one thing for forever.
So, you just kinda had to realize this is temporary.

And then you said, about prayer?

Prayer, 100% yeah.

OK, did you have, can you think of a difficult decision
that you had to make during BUD/S? What went through your mind as you
had to make that decision?

Being, uhm, I’ve been LPO of four different classes, throughout my
time at BUD/S, And, uhm, you know, sometimes as an LPO, I can’t exactly
remember like a particular moment, but sometimes you have to pass on
news to guys that, they don’t want to hear. And I think that’s, I like,
everybody wants to be loved.Right, and you don’t want to be hated for
stuff you do and say, and sometimes you have to be the bad guy and
approach people in uncomfortable situations when they're not doing the
right thing. So, yeah those are always difficult moments to have to have
those heart to hearts, uhm. Especially when you think they’re a good
guy, but maybe they're just getting lax in a certain area, you have to
be the bad guy sometimes. And it stinks, but it’s required. You’re not
bettering them and you’re not bettering yourself by taking that path,
so. It’s tough.

So overall, why do you think you were successful in
completing BUD/S?

Uhm, I would say a lot of it is not necessarily on me. I would say
I've had men around me that have inspired me, and again, you know, added
the fact that I have a strong relationship with Jesus, but yeah, I think
it’s, like I remember moments when we’re like, under the boat with the
guys where they encouraged me when I was in a bad, you know, place. Like
during hellweek, I lost 20 pounds and I was in a really bad place
physically, and, uhm, my buddies really looked out for me when things
were getting, you know, when the body was really taking a physical toll.
So, uh, I would say definitely the guys have helped me but I would also
just say that preparation to get here, you know making sure I practiced
discipline and what not. Sometimes the easy thing is not the right
thing, and if you can just give yourself a moment where you do something
that makes you uncomfortable it’s gonna feed into the other things that
you do in life because you realize that you've done it before and you
can get your brain to a place that you can accept this is something that
I don’t want to do and I don't’ care to do at all, but it’s what is
required and I think that discipline definitely has helped.

Did you notice anything different in the people that quit?
Or those who didn’t make it? Can you describe the differences between
you and them?

Uhm, I would say in some of the guys that I know that did quit,
there was either a lack of confidence within themselves. Like, they
would ask a lot of questions about evolutions coming up, and stuff like
that. Like we all ask questions, and none of us are excited about
certain evolutions that would come up, but there was a fear that you
could sense, that would bring itself up. Then a lot of guys that, uh
quit, would be guys that would go to, or take sick days or stuff like
that. Like all the sudden, days when you would have boats, medical, guys
would be going to medical and stuff like that and it was almost like it
was escaping for them. Not to say that there weren’t some guys that
actually had stuff going on, it was just funny how on those days, all
the sudden there were a lot more dudes going to medical for whatever
reason, and also, uh, guys that were on the front of being the biggest
and the baddest, and guys that would do a lot of talk. I remember at
prep we had guys that you know, based upon the way they talked about the
way they were gonna get after it, it was like “OK, I guess you got this
in the bag, man.” And uh, you actually put them in the situation and
it’s, uhm, entirely different.

You’re not the first person to say that.

It’s a mask.

OK. And then, I have two more questions for you. How did
this experience change you as a person?

The resilience aspect of it has been incredible. You know your
patience for, uhm, inconvenience, really boosts, uh, but I also treasure
moments when there is downtime to a whole new extreme. I think that when
you're not doing something where you’re utilizing yourself to your full
potential, the moments where you have downtime just aren’t as
satisfying. When I have a moment just to sit with my wife and talk and
just watch TV, it’s like, I don’t want to say I've earned the right to
sit down on the couch, it’s like, you don’t feel guilty, like “I worked
hard today.” It’s good to kinda just sit and live in the moment. It’s
very satisfying.

OK. And then lastly, SOCOM is trying to figure out what
makes people get through this, you know. What should I have asked you
that might have given me a little bit of insight that I didn't ask you.
What do you think i should have asked?

What are your priorities?

To the student? To the student, to the…

To, to the student. What are, like, what are the priorities? I
think, I think we have a tendency in life to make things idols, and
while this is a job that you should work the utmost for, and it should
be something that, when, especially things that just don’t hold as much
weigh in life, this should be your focus. Like if you wanted to go out
with your buddies and stuff like that, but you knew you needed to sit
down and study for an upcoming test that you have, like you have to
devote that time. But, I’ll tell you my priority list is God, my wife,
then everything else. It’s just the way it is. This is definitely the
priority as far as what I’m working for, but I, I hold my faith and my
God up the highest, and my relationship to my wife is, uhm, a lot of the
instructors have said, “When you’re no longer in the teams, who do you
have?” And my wife is who I have. And we’re hoping we live a long life
together, so yeah, my family is going to be there. So that is, uhm,
yeah.

That’s a good thing to ask. “What are their priorities?”

Yeah, priorities, you know, something that’s too...sometimes we
have a tendency to place things as idols in our lives, it can end up
becoming more of a hindrance than, than anything else. I think that’s
the point I’m trying to make.

Awesome, thank you so much, that was really helpful.

It was a pleasure.
: QUINN BARBER

DATE: 16AUG20

PARTICIPANT : 555 AND 139

LENGTH OF THE INTERVIEW: 41

Can you tell me, is it Okay if I record you?

Yes.

And can you tell me what your numbers are?

Uh 555 and 139.

Okay and then when did you start BUD/S and is this your
first BUD/S experience?

Uhm, yes it’s my first BUD/S experience, uh but I started
BUD/S in December 2018. So it’s been a while.

With 337?

335

335. You’re my second guy that’s been 335.

(Laughter)

Okay so how many siblings do you have and what birth order
like an older sister, younger brother? What’s, what do you?

I have a younger sister and I am the oldest.

And were your parents married, separated, divorced?

They are married.

And then what’s your relationship with them?

Uh, it's very good, I talk to them pretty much everyday.
(chuckle)

Awesome, as a mom I like to hear that.

I couldn’t, I couldn’t have done it like without being able
to have that support system.

That’s great.

A lot has happened in the past year so it’s, being able to
have that to fall back on is, is really good.

Awesome, now what life change, changing events have
happened in your life prior to BUD/S and what that means is whatever you
think its means so if you have one thing that’s great, if you have
nothing that’s great, if you have five things that’s great.

Hmm. When I was 18, I uh I played football and I brOkaye my
leg and I have a, got metal uhm, in my tibia my fibula and they said I
would never run again and stuff and I had already planned on trying to
do this so that was I guess that was pretty life changing. And then uh.

Yeah, so how did that experience factor into this, your
BUD/S?

Not really at all, like that was like the first time I
think that I really had to like overcome something and do rehab and be
extremely disciplined and try an get to an end point.

So that was, you were a senior then right?

Yes, so I was trying to play baseball in the next, for the
next season. That’s all I cared about and then uhm divulged into this
cause I knew I was going to uh be in college but yeah.

Okay and how do you think your personality helped you, uh
contributed to your progression through BUD/S?

Uhm. I don’t know, uh, I would say like I’m pretty type A
but I’ve learned to really compartmentalize things pretty well and care
about what you need to care about and uh not let your mind wander and
think about the, like the bullshit stuff.

Mhm. Okay, so what in your background even led you into
becoming a SEAL? Did you know somebody?

Uh.

Did you have a family member?

My family was in the military but uh my, my dad was, he was
in the reserves. My grandfather was in..

Army? Navy?

Army. And then my grandfather was in the 11^(th) airborne
and like they never pressured me or anything, but it was just kinda
always there. And my parents never pressured me to do anything and so
when I told them I wanted to do this, they were like Okay. It wasn’t
like a huge shock.

Okay, and then tell me a little bit about your childhood
specifically how were you disciplined if you did something wrong you
know did your parents spank you, did they give you time out did they
take away….

Yeah, (Laughs) They weren’t afraid, afraid to discipline me
at all but that was my biggest fear disappointing them so it didn’t
happen very often but ya know? They did if they needed to.

And did you move around a lot?

No been in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania my entire life.

And then tell me about your teenage years, were you in any
team sports?

Yeah, so I played football ...

That’s right.

And baseball all through highschool. Uhm, was recruited to
play in college, didn’t end up…

To do what? Baseball? Football?

Yeah both sports actually. I ended up playing football like
my junior senior year of college.

So you skipped, oh cause your, your.

No, I, I uh ended up uh just walking on, I was tired of not
playing a sport, and being athletic, being on a team.

And what school did you go to?

I went to Virginia Military Institute.

Okay. Uhm, and then was your teams pretty tight knit.

Uh.

Teams that you were on.

Yes, the most successful ones always had the most fun on
yes, like we were pretty close. Had some of my best friends on those
teams.

And what did you do in the last five years of your life
prior to BUD/S? So you went to college.

Uh, I pretty much went to college and then I uh..

And that, you graduated from VMI?

Mhm, and then I enlisted that summer after and yeah I was
uh, I was married, ended up getting divorced while I was through BUD/S,
I know that’s probably important in some respects so.

Yeah, uhm, I would say, so, do you think BUD/S contributed
to that?

No.

Okay.

Maybe, yes, probably I don’t know.

(laughs)

There’s a lot of different things.

Okay.

But uh, yeah, no, that all happened just during BUD/S so it
wasn’t like (unintelligible).

That can’t make it easy. Gosh.

Its whatever at this point (laughs).

Yeah.

But It was quite the ups, ups and downs through the last
year.

Yeah, would you consider yourself impulsive like do you
have any tattoos..do you?

I have tattoos but they weren’t, they were very thoughtful
and planned out.

Okay, Okay.

The only thing impulsive maybe I think I’ve ever done was
get married before I wanted to.

Okay.

That’s about it (laughter).

Okay and then what do you think was the most challenging
thing you did at BUD/S and feel like your hardest day and what motivated
you to push through?

Uh, one (unintelligible). Uhm, I would say the first week
back in my second class with 37, the one I ended up spending hell week
with, like just getting back to the grind of it was probably was just
that was just miserable. Just not in a good mood. But just uh, what
helped me get through I don’t, I don’t know I just.. like I said just
don’t think about, honestly I know that’s bad but you just don’t think
you just do it.

That’s how? Did you have any practices like mental,
physical, spiritual things that helped you?

Uhm, I pray.

Talk to yourself? Pray?

Uhm, that’s pretty broad stuff.

Yeah.

Just, just whatever’s in the moment helps...

Okay.

really.

Did you have any difficult decisions that you faced, uhm,
that you had to struggle with like, uhm, running out classmates or
turning in someone who cheated or didn’t do the right thing and what did
you have to think about when you made those choices?

Uhm, will I be able to trust him. Uhm, running through our
house with live ammunition. And do I trust him to make the right
decision when no one else is around.

Can you give me an example?

Uhm, meaning a time that happened?

Yeah.

Uh yeah, fairly recently, uh a guy got flown home from the
island because he was literally just saying like outlandish things like
personal attacks on the instructors and he wouldn’t let it go. And then
he was prior enlisted in the marine corps, he uh, he was like
(unintelligible) in 2015 and that’s why I wanted to come here. And
that’s why you want to get a job?

Yeah.

Just weird.

Okay.

I had no, no qualms about turning in someone like that. Not
turning in

Yeah.

But speaking the truth.

No that’s exactly what I was looking for, stuff like that
cause that’s hard cause you know you’re making an impact on them. Uhm,
why do you think you were successful in BUD/S?

Uhm, when you fail as much as I have in the last thing,
uhm, pretty used to rebounding and uh experienced a lot of setbacks in
college years so it's just like I’m going to get through this and I
just, need to figure out how.

That is a great attitude.

It's always like a puzzle, so.

Yeah, so this is kind of asking the same question in a
different way, did you notice anything different about all the people
who didn’t make it? Like what made them so they failed?

I don’t know, they make excuses a lot.

Okay.

Uhm, they tried to rationalize certain things and decisions
they’ve made. And they claim things other like other factors that are
not themselves.

Yeah.

So, that’s about it.

What do you think, how did this experience of BUD/S change
you as a person?

Sure a lot of people say that it has humbled them and it
definitely has humbled me but I also have learned that I can't do it
without my family or my friends or I, can't do it without those guys and
uh I also learned like through the ups and downs you really have to know
who you are as a person. And you have to have things to fall back on,
concrete things that you know about yourself and ...

Wow, that’s pretty deep. So can you give me an example?

Uh, I know that I have to go to the gym at least three
times a week or run 3 to 4 times a week to keep my mental sanity
something like that. I have to read a book every three weeks. Three to
four weeks. Or have to spend a certain amount of time outside. Solitude.
Have to talk to my family, certain time, at least once every other day,
stuff like that.

That’s good to know about yourself though. That’s awesome.

Kinda, kinda forced into it. Why aren’t you being
successful, you gotta figure it out so.

Yeah, so the Navy has asked us to do this to figure out
before people come to BUD/S what makes them successful. So we’re kinda
throwing a wide net, is there anything else that you can think of I
should’ve asked you? That might be the key to what makes people
successful.

Uh, that’s a good question and I definitely have an answer,
but I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Uhm, ask, I would
ask about hobbies. Because there’s, uhm, a lot of people that read,
there’s a lot of people that don’t, and there’s probably nothing that is
similar between anybody maybe some things that are similar between guys
like what they do in their free time but I'm willing to bet that is just
a plethora of different things that is just all over the place. Yes we
are all the same in some aspects but not ... I don’t know.

No, that’s good. Nobody’s said that yet so that is, that is
a good.

People always say like it's common men with an uncommon
desire to succeed, and I heard someone say no it's uncommon people
working in a common space, so.

Hm, interesting, thank you so much.

So, I’m gonna, is it OK if I record this?

Yes.

And, what's your number?

140.

140. Thanks. So we’re gonna start with something easy. Just
tell me how many siblings you have and where you are in the birth order?

I’m the oldest, uhm, I had an older brother, actually, he died
when I was super young from cancer. I have a younger brother and younger
sister.

OK. And then, if you think about your life experiences,
what might you describe as your crucible, or really life changing even
that happened in your life before getting here?

Uhm, I don’t know. I’m not sure, I’d probably have to think on
that for a minute.

OK. Uhm, how do you think your personality contributed to
your progression through BUD/S? You made it, a lot of people didn’t.
What about you has made you successful?

Actually I did have a, my wife and I separated, when, like right
before I went back in the class. And that definitely played a huge part
in me just getting after it.

So when you say you separated, are you divorced?

I'm not divorced, we’re just separated, trying to work things out.

OK. So did that experience…

I think that would probably be the crucible that helped a big…

So how did that help or impact your experience here at
BUD/S?

Uhm, because it went from having a family in the skull, to having
nothing but the skull. So I had to make it. I had to make it through.

OK. So what about, your personality? What made you
successful as far as your personality goes?

Growing up, I always got in the ocean, no matter what. Uhm, did
that restart?

No it’s OK.

Yeah, I always got in the water everyday no matter what. No matter
how cold it was. Even though this makes me very cold, I really didn’t
like getting in the water when it came to BUD/S. I still get in the
water all the time, surfing, and diving, and all that stuff. Uh, I was
really comfortable underwater. There were people who came here who were
recreational divers, I was one, but I don’t think that really made a
difference. It depends individual to individual. Im just really
comfortable underwater. I’ve done a lot of long distance events, like
ironmans and stuff, and I just think that like continuous physical
output plays a big part because you go for like hours and hours and
hours, very similar to this.

OK. So…

Obviously not on this level, but very similar.

So, let me go back to what made you first want to be a
SEAL.

Uh, my dad was a Green Beret. Uh, enlisted and then he put in a
package to come to BUD/S as an officer. At the same time he submitted
for the Army’s warant officer program, got selected for that first, so
he just chose that. Then he always told me he regretted it. But, growing
up, I wanted to be a ranger, I don’t know why, it was just what was
always in my head. Then I started looking at SEALs and changed my mind
in highschool, and here I am.

OK. Tell me about growing up? How were you disciplined as a
child, like what did your parents do if you did something wrong? Did
they spank you, did they do timeouts?

Growing up, they spanked me and stuff like that. Toward like high
school, I started to have really bad relationship with my father so we
had altercations and stuff, but that’s uh, I think that played a part, I
guess...

OK.

At making me resilient.

OK, tell me about your teenage years? Did you move around,
did you play sports?

Yes, so I was all over the place. I wrestled, played football,
track, soccer one year, uhm I did my last two years of high school in
Italy. We played other..

Where in Italy?

Uh, Vincenza.

OK, I was in Livorno.

Oh yeah?

So, right, I loved it too, it was really team oriented.

Yeah, I loved it. Small schools, so you played against other
American schools. It was great.

Now what about the last five years of your life prior to
BUD/S? Did you go straight from high school, then bootcamp?

No, so I tried to come into the Navy, I knew this was going to be
an issue before coming into the Navy. My eyesight was way beyond what it
needed to be. I think the minimum was 20/70, and I had 20/400. So, I
came into the Navy as a corpsman. It’s a very difficult pathway to get
here when already being in the fleet. Super selective. It sucked. I came
in, literally miracles lined up in timelines to where I could get here.
Got eye surgery, and then submitted all my paperwork and get here.
Pretty short story, I guess.

No, that’s helpful. Would you consider yourself impulsive?
Like, do you have tattoos? Do you binge drink?

I drink. I like drinking. Uhm, I would consider myself a beer
connoisseur, because I love beer *laughs*. Uhm, not to like professional
level, obviously, but I like trying new beers.

What about impulsiveness?

Uh, I don’t have any tattoos, yet. Uh, I will maybe this weekend.
Not impulsive considering making stupid decisions. No.

OK, that’s what I’m getting at.

Impulsive considering like, “hey lets go to the beach for no
reason.” Yeah.

OK. And then, what motivates you on a daily basis?

Uhm, at work? For coming to work and…

You made it through and a lot of people didn’t. What keeps
you going?

I think a big part is people, people who used to tell me I
wouldn’t be able to make it through, and just coming here and proving
them wrong.

OK.

Uhm, other than that, I have my family, I can’t let them down. And
the biggest, I think, I’m not gonna let myself down. I have to do it
regardless.

OK. And what was the most challenging component that you
had? Think about your hardest day at BUD/S?

Uhm, so, honestly with all the situation with my wife back then,
there wasn’t, like hellweek did not affect me nearly as much as it did
most people. I don’t, I didn’t have a time in hellweek where I was like
“I don’t want to be here.” It was just putting my body through the meat
grinder. But uhm, something recently was the gas. The gas, they have a
brutal CS gassing session on the island that is just, exponential levels
and just like the little baby gas chamber _*undecipherable*_. It’s just
awful. Like guys run away, guys, it’s crazy.

So what motivated you to get through these things?

Through that? Oh, I just knew I just had to do it. It’s short and
it’s extremely painful, but it's short. Uhm, it's definitely the most
painful thing in my mind that I've done. Hellweek sucks yeah, and it
takes a long time. But, I guess pain for time, it's just insane. I mean
pain as in pain to a time as in how long it takes. It’s like 60 seconds,
but it’s just excruciating. I can’t even describe it.

OK. And then, did you feel like you were supported by the
group during these tough times?

Yeah, you make friends and one of the big things that helped me I
guess was my instructors told me once, “Hey if you focus more on helping
your buddies out, you won't’ focus on yourself, and you won’t think
about quitting.” Or, something along those lines. So I tried to look
after my buddies as much as I could, but uhm, and that definitely
helped. It helped with team cohesion. Because you know youre all in this
together, you all have this goal, and you all tell each other you’re
gonna make it through, and all of my close friends made it through
hellweek. And some of them didn’t make it through the test gates later
on and got dropped. But if you find a really good tight knit group of
guys then...it definitely helps.

So what practices did you utilize to help you push through
the challenges? Like did you do mental things, or spiritual things, or…?

Uhm, just like before I’d go out and, I never really had anything.
I wouldn’t pray, I didn’t do any ritual or anything, I kinda just like
sent it with the boys. That’s pretty much it. We just fire each other
up, I guess. Before, during, after, just thinking about it weeks ahead,
weeks after, it still gets us fired up. I don't know, just being in it
with my friends.

OK. Did you have any difficult decisions while you were in
BUD/S training? And what went through your mind when you had to make
decisions?

Difficult decisions? Just concerning anything?

Yes. Some people said they didn’t have any. But you know,
if you had something that you had to do…?

I don’t, I don’t think so, honestly.

OK. So why were you successful at completing BUD/S? What
made you different from the people that didn’t make it?

In the beginning?

The whole thing.

Well, once I feel like once you get through OC8 and the gas and
all the post first phase test gates, I feel like once you get past OC8
or something like that, there’s no one thing that’s gonna keep you from
quitting, I guess. Or there’s nothing that’s gonna make you quit.
Because hellweek is so long and just exhausting that…Could you repeat
that question again? I kinda veered off on that one.

OK. So what did you have that others did not have?

I think the whole situation with my wife in the beginning was like
an absolute crazy motivator. I mean we’re still together, figuring
things out, but that was like, if I didn’t make it through then I would
have nothing. Especially since this is a goal that I’ve had since I was
so young, and it took me so long to get here.

So, what about people who didn’t make it? Do you think…

I don’t know. They might not have had that motivator back in their
mind. Or, they just lost focus. They get too caught up in the moment.
Because pain will always stop.

OK, we’re almost finished, two more questions. So how did
this experience change you as a person?

This experience definitely made me realize that things can get
really, really awful, but your mental attitude towards it plays a huge
part. BUD/S is absolutely physical. Whereas, a lot of people say these
special operations programs are 80% mental and 20% physical. I would
think, BUD/S is 100% physical and 100% mental. It’s unlike anything
else. It’s, just your attitude to anything will affect your performance.

So, my last question: what should I have asked you that I
didn’t ask you? What do you think is important for SOCOM to know about
trying to select people for BUD/S? What will make them successful?

Not all the guys that are absolute physical studs are good guys.
You need to find a guy who’s a good performer and a good dude, I guess.
Someone who’s a teammate.

So a good performer and a good person?

Yes.

That’s great.

Not just a...

Not just a physical stud.

And, I think they do a good job weeding those people out. For the
most part, or identifying them in some manner.

That’s awesome, thank you so much.

I’m gonna need your number and your consent to record.

Yes. 143 is my number and you can record.

143. Great, awesome.I’m just gonna start with some easy
questions. How many siblings do you have?

Uh, two siblings, older sister and younger brother. We’re all
pretty much separated by two years.

OK. And then, when you think of your life experience what
one would think would you describe as your crucible of life shaping
experience that you’ve had?

Uhm, so I was actually in a previous class here, in 321, and I’m
now in 338. I didn’t quit, but I had a liberty violation. I got in
trouble on the last day of...If you're familiar with the pipeline at
all, it’s the very end before you come out here. And, yeah I got dropped
with a couple of my buddies, and I had to go to the fleet for two and a
half, three years. So that was pretty, especially with this career, life
shaping I’d say.

Yeah, I would say so too. So how did that factor into your
experience at BUD/S?

This time around?

Yeah.

Uhm, you can’t really mimic or create in your own mind, uh that
whole, uh experience that I had being in the fleet. I didn’t enjoy it at
all. It’s not anything I ever wanted to do, and it’s really hard to get
back at all. So, I think in the back of my mind that was always there. I
think I would have made it the first time through to be honest with you.
But, definitely this time around I had a respect for what the
alternative is if you don’t make it.

OK. I would agree with that. So do you think your
personality contributed to your successful progression through that?

I think so. I think so.

In what way?

I think I'm generally a pretty easy going guy. And, I think, like
a lot of people here we find a lot of humor in the bad stuff, uhm the
hard stuff, uh, when its time to you know buckle up and do it we all get
it done, you know, buckle up and work hard but, I think we all have that
kind of sick sense of humor, almost. I think it's pretty helpful making
it through a long grueling pipeline, like this.

There is. I would agree. OK, so then, describe your
background that led you to becoming part of the seal community?

Sure, well hopefully, but yeah. So I'm 28 years old. I come from a
good family. Upper middle class. Uh, we, I grew up in Richmond, VA,
mainly, but I had moved all over before. My parents, uh, both, uh, they
met at Princeton. I’m sure it will come up. All five of the people in my
immediate family went to Princeton. Uh, so they met there, had really
successful New York jobs, quit, traveled the world and then kinda
settled down after that. And then, growing up, we also traveled to
Paris, and Abu Dhabi, and abroad when I was really young, those are my
first memories. Uhm, but grew up in Richmond mainly, and now my family
lives right outside DC. And, uh, basically what I’m saying is none of
that would have shaped me to be a SEAL, but maybe, 28, I’m old enough to
remember exactly where I was when 9/11 happened. I’m probably one of the
few guys in this class that even remembers that. My parents knew people
that were there, and my mom would have been working in the World Trade
Center if she stayed in New York. So little things like that, uhm, not
little things like that. But, that was a huge, I guess catalyst, that
had me thinking about it from a very young age. I played sports. I
played sports in college. So being a part of a team was always a big
thing.

What kind of sports?

I played lacrosse. But, I played every sport imaginable growing
up. In high school, I played football and basketball, as well. Uhm, so I
loved that. I really, really enjoyed that.

So what did you enjoy about that?

Uhm, so growing up, I was always the best at the sports. Which was
great. Then you get to college and Princeton lacrosse is routinely top
10, top 20 in the country. I got there and was not as good as I was
relative to when I was in high school. And, so you really kind of learn
how to be a very good teammate, I think. And I think I really didn’t
even learn it until my senior year. When you get to the point where
you’re more happy to see your teammates succeed than you succeed, which
you know, everyone kinda says that. And, I said that when I was in high
school, college eve, but I remember distinctly getting to that point
where I was just so happy that this guy, who essentially was taking my
spot, I was just really happy, that he was succeeding. And I think that
brotherhood, if you will, is really only replicated in the military,
especially kinda in the elite military but I think that that really
steered me towards SEALs. Even over any other branch or unit. Uhm, I was
looking for that and I think I definitely found it so I'm really happy.

What about your childhood, how were you disciplined as a
child?

My parents were very strict, but not in a like I loved them the
whole time. I was never fearful of my parents.They were the best parents
I think you could have, I had an awesome childhood. Uh, a lot of you
know, fun vacations and I mean they were great.

If you did something wrong, what did they do? Did they
spank you? Timeout?

Maybe a timeout? I don't know, and this sounds bad, because I
definitely don’t think I'm this way now, but it was the most well
behaved kid you could imagine. The school I went to, you had a dress
code, you had to wear a collared shirt, tuck your shirt in, “yes ma’am,
yes sir” kinda thing, cute little Southern Virginia boy. And I was that,
so I mean I never wanted to make them get to that point, but if they
did, you know, you could tell I just, maybe, we were never grounded or
anything like that. There was never any incentive to, like, get A’s or
anything like that. Couldn't watch TV during the week. We had family sit
down dinners during the week every night. And you know, I think my
parents both *undecipherable* those were two really important things. We
were really close in the family. Um, my mom would go like come home from
school and like they let me play first and instead of doing homework
right away. My mom would throw the football with me and my dad would
come home late and we would play, um I had a great childhood. Which,
yeah. I don't know if there is anything there that necessarily.

Not looking for anything in particular.

Exactly, yeah. But no, none of those like horror stories that I
...

No, no, I am not saying… What have the last five years of
your life looked like prior to BUD/S?

Um, so, right after college, I was actually a sixth grade history
teacher, um which I loved. Uh, and it wasn't like I was a substitute
teacher or an assistant, I was, this was … sorry I don’t know if I am
allowed to say that, but yeah, so I was a history buff and I taught 91
kids at private school in Atlanta, 5 classes about 20 kids in each class
and uh I taught um uh I guess we start with pre-history all the way up
to medieval times, Rome, Egypt, Greece, all that, very basic stuff, but
I had a blast. Uh, I had the same kind of maturity level back then. I
coached three sports three seasons. Um so, I loved it, but kind of like
I said before this was always calling. Um, I had surgery my senior year
of college on my hip, so I didn’t really, I wasn't physically ready to
enter right away and I didn't really want to go straight in, um so
teaching for a year was awesome. I do wish I had probably done two or
three retrospect after I ended up getting kicked out, you know, for…

Yeah.

Then going into the Navy. But uh, so that's what I, I did that,
then spent probably 6 months getting in shape and preparing to come into
the Navy and then I’ve been in the Navy since March 2016, so coming up
on almost 4 years. So, I was uh, a corpsman based out in Norfolk.

OK. What motivates you on a daily basis to keep going?

Um, I mean it’s not like every day I wake up I’m like “hooyah” to
get going, but when you talk about what motivates me each day, um, well
I am married too, and my wife, she’s in grad school, she’s very
disciplined in everything she does, much like better than I ever was, so
you know, she’ll come home and immediately start studying and we’ve got
a dog and she takes him and feeds him and all that stuff, um where as
you know I come home from this and I just want to watch netflix and
relax. But uh, she definitely, it’s definitely an inspiration to keep
going and my parents are both very successful, not, you know, workaholic
type people, but they just, you know, are always wanting to kind of do
something. So, I think maybe that good type of pressure from my family…

What did your family say when you, you know, you graduated
from Princeton, and you were a history…

When I initially told my mom, she cried *laughs*. Her dad was
actually in the Navy as well. And her grandfather was 4 star admiral in
the Navy, um, and her dad was at Pearl harbor when it was bombed, so
there is some history there. But, by no means was I raised in a military
type family. They have always been very supportive of anything I wanted
to do. There has never been, almost to a fault, almost, never pressuring
one direction, like “hey I am doing this, what do you think,” kind of
like “whatever you want to do” like, you know when I was choosing
schools, I really didn't want to choose Princeton because it was
expected and everyone did that. They never steered me in any way there,
same with my sister and my brother. They all kind of do their own
things, like “alright, that’s kind of the route that works best for all
of us.” So, it has been pretty cool and I hope at least when I am a
parent to be like that. I dont want to ever force anything on my kids.

Sure.

So, yeah. enlisted versus officer, yeah. I am enlisted too. So,
kind of explaining that once again there was never a “you should be an
officer” or “you shouldn't be in the military.”

Did you think about that, being an officer versus being
enlisted

I mean, maybe initially, a little bit. Once I kind of, learned
more, you know, I know some people and once I learned more of what the
job entails, I do want to be the guy, the one that is doing a little bit
more, uh, that I think is more in line with the enlisted route than the
officer route. I don't know how familiar you might be, you know, I might
even be…

Twenty-two years in the army, but, I don’t know much about
Navy, so

It is probably fairly similar, but you know, the officer, you get
a couple deployments, some action I guess, and then after that it is
more administrative, but uh…

I agree with that.

So, that is the way it was kind of pitched to me. The other way
appealed to me, especially because I figured if I really wanted to, I
could always go to OCS hopefully. It’s honestly not even something I
have thought about to this point.

So, going back to BUDS what was the most challenging thing
to you, like think about your hardest day at BUDS and what, what was
that most challenging thing you had to do?

Um, the hardest part was roll, I was in 337 initially, but I was
rolled for OC8 which is our pool comp. Uh, so, the scuba test where they
are tying your hose behind your back and you can’t breathe all that
craziness, and that was the first time where I was like, at least in um,
the first phase, everything that is hard physically, is like “okay this
sucks, but I can do this.” With that one, you can’t really grind out,
you really have to slow down and focus, um, so that was kind of the gut
check for me saying, OK, it’s not like, you know, plenty people are
tough enough but you really have to focus when you are under stress I
think. And in that respect, ithink that test is pretty awful and I was
able to practice it, which I was really proud of, I practiced it for two
months with all the other rollbacks, which was a bunch of… practiced for
two months, we got really good at it. You know crushed it on the next
time through, which was probably the proudest I have been through this
whole process. You know, it feels good to feel like you crushed
something that previously seemed insurmountable. Uh, so that was fun.

Good, and then, what motivated you to push through that
event and did you feel like your classmates helped you, like were you
supported by them?

Definitely, like… this, 338, I am glad you guys are doing the test
on 338 because, previously being in 3-7 and then 3-8 and I love the guys
in 338. In 3-7, I like them a lot, and thought that you know, OK, “we
are tight, we got this,” and then I got here and I realized what a
better class 38 was. So, yeah, there was at the time, at the time I was
retaking my last test, they had only known me for a couple weeks, uhm
but the rollbacks, you know I’d been with through hellweek and through
the first part of uh 3-7’s second phase, uh we all got really close,
which was awesome. That was probably the most fun I’ve had, going back
into second phase with these guys. So, and then going back to the whole
team and not just being a team but being a, literally a brotherhood, and
the type of team where you want everyone to succeed so badly, uh, even
more than you want yourself to succeed, that I think we all haduh, among
that crew, and we all did, all the rollbacks passed, which I think is
pretty rare. I don’t know, but all of us, I think there were 16 of us
and 16 of us passed the second time and…

Nice.

And I think that says a lot about our motivation, or yeah, our
motivation.

What about, what practices did you use to help push through
the challenges, like spiritual, mental, physical?

Yeah, so, um, typically, I guess previously, challenges were like,
“aw man I didn't make the starting line up, or I didn’t do well on this
test, whatever” then coming to something like this where it’s like,
alright this is essentially life or death, you know, im either gonna get
through this or i'm not gonna get through this. It was the first time I
had turned to, you know, I was super, I had never been this stressed out
in my life, so I actually, yeah I definitely probably read more, listen
to, like, podcasts and actually did some meditation apps, which if you
told me I was doing meditation apps before I would have been like “no
way,” but I actually did some of those things. And we learned, and it
was nothing new to me, but like visualization techniques, and things
like that, that I previously never really employed, but I definitely
employed this time around. Uhm, definitely employed this time around.
Especially with OC8, by the time, my second time around, I was kinda
really at peace with what was gonna happen. I was like “I’m as prepared
as I was for any test in my life, and it’s gonna happen or it’s not
gonna happen.” And then, that moment when you hit the water and I was
like “OK, I got this.” And I think that was the most zen I had been in
my life and there have been times that I had that zen moment, but I
think, probably all those factors contributed to it.

OK. And then, think of a decision that you had to make
during BUD/S. What went through your mind as you made that decision and
can you give me an example?

Uhm, give me a moment. First, I’d say people talk about, “Oh did
you ever think about quitting?” And the honest answer is no, I never
thought about quitting, uhm, as far as the decision, uhm.

Maybe there aren't a lot of decisions that you make in
BUD/S?

I think there is. I mean like, as far as like, a “keep going
thing,” or like uh, I mean there was definitely times where, uh. I don’t
know. Sorry.

That’s OK.

Maybe, can we swing back around?

Yeah, sure.

I’ll see if I can think of a good one.

And, why do you think you were successful in completing
BUD/S?

I mean honestly, I think a lot, I think I’d go back to, even
though I said it probably didn’t attribute anything, my upbringing. Uhm,
uh, just the fact that i've put so much effort into this. Uhm, and I do,
I don't think that I'm like a type-A crazy person. But, I am, I am very
competitive, and I do definitely kind of put pressure on myself, I
guess.

But you're not a type-A?

I don’t think I'm a type-A a guy. I usually say I’m not a type-A
guy, but I guess I probably don’t…

Ok.

Don’t have the right idea of what type-A is.

OK. Nope that’s fine.

But, no, uhm, you know I just want to, I want to be a SEAL for all
the corny reasons. Uhm, but you know I do wanna also, uhm, be a part of
this team and be able to have that sense of purpose, too. So I think
that does drive you. And on a day to day, I just kinda look at it as any
other thing, you know. It’s not like you go to school, you go to school
everyday, it’s not like you, I don't know. It’s…

Well, let me ask you this, then. What about the people that
didn’t make it? What differences did you see with them?

Uhm, throughout my, both classes, or really all three classes I’ve
been in, there have been people that really surprise me. Uh, as far as
the ones that really surprise you go, whether those are people that you
know I got along with really well, uh, for whatever reason, friends that
didn’t make it. Honestly I would probably attribute it to some type of
moment of weakness, or, I don’t think that it was necessarily...I
wouldn’t label them as a quitter, I wouldn’t say, I wouldn't, I wouldn’t
not trust that person with something later on in my life you know if we
run into each other it’s not like I think oh he's not gonna follow
through on this. But maybe, I don't, know, I don't know, I just never
thought that I wasn't gonna make it, and maybe that’s part of it.

OK. Would you consider yourself impulsive?

Uh, I wouldn’t consider myself impulsive…

Like, do you have tattoos, do you binge drink?

I don't have tattoos, uh, I like to, I like to be spontaneous, but
I dont think it's impulsive, I don't buy things, I don't do anything
crazy like that, I'm pretty, you know, fiscally conservative. Uhm, yeah
no tattoos, no, uh...

No? OK.

I don’t think I’m impulsive, yeah.

We’re getting down to the wire. We have two more questions.
How did this experience change you as a person? Getting through this
time?

Uh, this time’s weird I’d say that, you get pummelled, I think
because there was not really, but I definitely, you know when you go
home and people say oh that’s incredible what you did, it makes you feel
uncomfortable too, uh, say how cool it is. I mean I don’t know if that’s
a good answer.

No, yeah.

But, yeah, I guess maybe, a little, I like to think I was humble
before, but hopefully better now. I think that’s what it does to people.
You know, you make it through, but you always think of those times when
you definitely weren't at your best and youre like “oh, wow, I still got
a long way to go.”

OK. And then, my last thing. We’re doing this for SOCOM so
they can help us, and really the Navy, figure out, how do we bring in
people that are gonna be successful? How do help these people be more
successful? What should I have asked you, that I didn’t ask you that
maybe would help the next group?

I guess you kinda asked, or maybe I just rambled on, I think I
mentioned a lot, I guess the “why?” I guess I mentioned the catalyst and
everything, you know, 9/11. And everyone’s got a different one, but I
think as long you like, but I think you mentioned that, so. But, yeah,
that's always something that maybe, I think people can make one up, but
you never really know. I don't know. You could piggyback off other
people’s “why’s?” in a good way or a bad way, but as long as I think you
know what your “why’s?” are you’re fine. But, I don't know, I think a
big part is just, yeah not wanting to leave these guys, yeah.

Yeah, no that’s good. I have to ask something off script.
So, when you were in Princeton going through that, did you think about
these days?

Uh, yeah, so I always, I probably decided I wanted to be a SEAL,
uh this would be when I read _Lone Survivor_, which was my senior year
of highschool in 2010, oe 2009, and that was when I was like “huh, I
wonder..” You know, cause everyones heard about it , but you don’t
really know. And then freshman year, there’s kinda been a weird, not
weird, it makes sense, I guess, but a pipeline of Princeton lacrosse
players that have come through. So when I, my freshman year there, there
was a guy who had just graduated and was just starting out, uhm and uh,
who actually was the OIC of our next training block, but he just left,
so I was bummed that I just missed him. But, there’s been like this
kinda pipeline through, uhm, through those guys. So yeah, I definitely
thought about it and playing a division one sport where it’s year round,
you're getting up everyday, you're doing these workouts with all these
guys, and it’s New Jersey, it’s cold mornings, you’re getting up early
in the morning and doing these tests. And, a lot of the tests are pretty
similar to what we do here. Similar type of athlete, where you need to
be fast, you have to run for endurance, you have to be strong. Uhm, so
it all kind of, you know, lacrosse is one of those sports where you find
a lot of these guys who played in this program. So, so yeah, I
definitely thought about what these would be like, what the days would
be like, I probably thought about it every day since 2010, and now I
finally got to do it. And, it was pretty close to what I expected.

And another thing that I think is interesting is that
you’re my third guy, and everyone, this is your second time through. And
I thought that you couldn’t come through a second time.

Oh yeah? So there’s not too many of us. There might be 7 of us, so
it’s good that you have a few of them.

Yeah.

But yeah, I’ve gotten to know those guys a lot too. And you get to
know them here and you’re like “how did you not make it through?” So,
uhm, yeah.

No thank you, that’s perfect.

And, I always remind them I didn’t quit. *laughs*

Right, right, well, yeah. You learned something.

Exactly.

Thank you, this was very helpful.

Um, so again, I’m recording. Is that okay?

Yes.

This is participant 145. Now I can ask the questions. So
easy questions first, how many siblings do you have?

Three.

Uh, what’s the birth order?

I’m the oldest

Um, and then what’s the gender of your siblings?

Two younger sisters and then one little brother.

Are the sisters..?

They’re in the middle, yeah.

So what do you think were your life experiences. If you
think of your life experiences, what might you think of as the crucible
or life shaping experiences?

BUD/S

Other than BUD/S (spoken around the same time as 145)

Um, prior to BUD/S?

Prior to that, yeah.

Uh, so, um, I came from the, I came from the Naval Academy so
there are a few things there. Um, there like, there’s some events. Uh,
screening (indiscernible) to come to BUD/S that are designed to do that
so that was the screening to even get here was probably some of the
hardest stuff I had to do in my life, but then growing up, um, playing
sports, uh, like I had a really tough high school soccer coach. Uh, and
swimming, um and uh, that was probably my my introduction to physically
challenging stuff.

Anything that happened in your childhood kind of formative?

Sure, uh, my parents divorced

Okay

Um, that was, uh, that was like a different kind of challenge, um

And how old were you?

I was a freshman in high school.

Okay

and the three younger siblings sort of like challenged made that
more challenging cause I felt like I had to hold it together for them.

Yeah, um, how do you think those experiences factored into
your experience here at BUD/S?

um, being like I said through that through that divorce like I had
to lead my siblings through it

Yeah

Um, and then through through BUD/S I was I was a boat crew leader
and in charge of a collateral duty and, um, so that that was sort of the
just being an older brother was the first time I had to be like a mentor
or a leader, I think. Um, so that that you can trace a line straight
from that to what I do here and um the physical the physical hardship
stuff like I said the sports um were uh how I learned to push through
pain and work hard.

How would you describe your personality and how do you
think your personality contributes to getting through BUD/S?

Um, I think, I think I try to keep a good sense of humor alway,
um, which was probably my best my best tool in terms of resilience. Uh,
and it also got me in trouble a couple of times. Uh

Here?

Yeah, uh here with instructors.

Just trying to make light of

Yeah, just pissed pissed instructors off

Yeah

Um, so that’s I think I think that's pretty central. Uh, I think
that I’m more comfortable, um, I’m more comfortable when I’m thinking
about other people rather than thinking about myself so being being an
officer really helped in in that regard because I didn’t really get
sucked into my own head ever, like I always had other guys that I could
be worrying about, um, which was really good. Uh, and I think I’m a
good, I think I have good presence like in a public setting like I think
I can speak well and um uh I’m not afraid of having eyes on me.

Right, keep going, I’m just jotting this down.

It’s okay

so I have a backup. Um,

So that again that again, it helped with it helped with
instructors scrutiny cause everyone gets that and it didn’t it didn’t
phase me as much as it phased other people and also like being in a in a
leadership role that that felt pretty natural to me.

Uh, would you consider yourself a calm person?

Yeah, I would. I think so.

Have you always been that way?

No

When did you kind of switch from not being as calm to being
more calm?

Um, probably pre pretty early like the beginning of middle school,
like early high school. Um, yeah I’m told that I was a terrible child.

Yeah

Like a really like a really bad temper and, um, yeah I just didn’t
I had a lot of energy and emotion and didn’t really know how to deal
with it. Um, but probably once once I started getting involved in stuff
outside of school and my house like I had outlets for that that energy
so.

What about your background made you want to become a part
of the Seal Community?

Uh, so I decided I decided on, the order was the Navy then being
an officer then the Seal Community um

So it was after you got the Academy?

Yeah, I was, so I was probably leaning towards this when I went
in, um, but I was also really intentional about trying to explore every
every option and talk to all different kinds of officers and um so I
narrowed down what exactly being a leader, being an officer meant to me
and then I tried to find the community that aligned best with that and
uh it ended up it ended up being the Seals um and then like specifically
the I wanted like the best, the really really really high quality
people, officer, and enlisted to work with and I wanted like autonomy
like I wanted a lot of responsibility as a as a junior officer, as a
young guy. Um, and I thought after doing my research over four years in
Annapolis this is this is where I found would be the best.

Um, did you come from a military family?

No.

Now, talk to me a little about your early childhood, so
pre-high school. What was that like?

So, like I like I said I was a uh like really bad as a young child
like a terrible temper, um, destructive. Like my uh, I guess I have
bipolar disorder in my family

Yeah

so my my parents took me to a child psychologist

Yeah

thinking I had that um and then the story goes that once I got to
school, uh, once I had outlets for all that all that energy and had like
tests to engage me, uh, I mellowed out a lot and uh I was like I was
pretty good at school all the way through like I picked it like I
learned quickly and um so I just needed something and um something to
direct all that all that energy at.

What about your parents parenting style? What was that
like?

Um, neither neither of them were really yellers.

Yeah

My (pause) probably like my mom was the main disciplinarian like
my dad is a pretty gentle guy uh and uh but there was never really like
they weren’t stern or uh strict really um

What was their discipline style: timeouts, taking toys?

Yeah, when I was really little it was spanking. Um, as I as I got
older it was enough for them just to like have a serious talk.

Yeah

Like let me know if I screwed up like let me know they’re
disappointed and that was good enough to, um, get the message across.

What about your teenage years? Um, well I guess the other
question, did you move around at all during your childhood?

Yeah (indiscernible)

(indiscernible)

Yeah, pretty much

Now what, now tell me a little bit about your teenage
years. Did you play team sports? What sports did you play?

Uh, so I played I played sports like all all year round up until
high school. Um, so I played soccer and basketball and baseball and swim
team and then

So that was in high school too?

So that was up until high school and then high school I dropped I
did soccer and swimming in high school. Uh, and then I did theater too.
I sung in a choir and did did drama, uh, and musicals. Um, but the thing
the dynamic that changed my teenage years was like the divorce, uh, and
figuring out how to just figuring out the new normal. That took most of
high school for me. There’s a lotta, I really resented my mom and
(indiscernible) between her and I when I was in high school and um
figuring out how to switch houses like dealing with my siblings and all
that so. That would be the defining.

So during that, I mean, did you move houses or were you
just splitting your time?

Yes, yeah, splitting time, yup. And my dad moved like really close
to my mom, uh, in the in the same neighborhood. But we were we were all
trying to figure out. My mom was a night shift nurse so at first we were
just like moving every couple days

Yeah

um, and then regularly like every week, but that was that was a
constant a constant battle.

Yeah

Yeah, at the beginning of high school. Just trying to figure out
what that looked like.

What about the last 5 years? I know you said you went to
the Naval Academy to here.

Yes, yup. Um, just uh I found I I I love the Naval Academy.

Yeah

I just, uh, feel like I was surrounded by like-minded people all
the time like smart, motivated, physically fit. Uh, like most of my best
friends are are were my Naval Academy classmates. My fiance is my Naval
Academy classmate. Just, uh, I thought that group of people I was with I
just synched with really, really well. Um, and it was always, I knew
that this was probably the this was going to be really challenging to
get picked for even, much less to get through. Um, so the whole time I
was going around, talking to all these different members of different
communities, uh, but I had it in the back of my head that if if I chose
to do something else other than this I would want it to be by choice.

Yeah.

and and I didn’t want I didn’t want to be like prohibited by my
fitness or my grades or whatever. I wanted this to be an option at the
end of the day, um, so I trained really hard and and was working with
this in mind even when I wasn’t a hundred percent sure that this was
where I was going to end up.

Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?

Yeah.

So can you describe some of the these impulsive behaviors?

Yes, um, uh I’m impulsive with money sometimes. I’m not, uh, I’m a
bad spender sometimes. Uh, sometimes like, um, once in a while I get
like an idea in my head that that like sticks and I work really hard to
make it happen even if it wasn’t like a super well thought out move. Um,
for example, so uh I’m engaged and my I knew I was going to propose to
my fiance, but um I was going to get to see her um like earlier in the
night and I had a plan of when I was going to propose to her when she
came out here to see me after Hell Week and that was when I was going to
do it, but I knew I was going to get to see her before then and I
thought so why don’t I just propose then. So it was like three weeks uh
and I sorta decided to do that in like five minutes and then I worked I
worked for three weeks to to make it all come together. Um, so that
sorta impulsiveness. Definitely.

What about any, um, tattoos or...?

No

Um, any driving violations like speeding tickets that sorta
thing?

Yeah, a couple speeding tickets, um, yeah.

Nothing crazy?

Nothing crazy, no.

What motivates you on a daily basis?

Um, on, during during BUD/S or or just in general?

Just in general.

So um, the peop the people around me. Both physically around me,
like the guys that I spend my day to day life with and then also my
family that I know is thinking about me. I know on a daily basis. They
just like I’m motivated by by other people.

Yeah.

Um, and then my, uh. I don’t know, my reputation, my own
reputation, but then also the reputation of like like the reputation,
um, like in in BUD/S Naval Academy guys do well. Um, that’s the
reputation that the Naval Academy has established and so I wasn’t going
to be the Naval Academy guy that ruined that. Um, that kind of thing.

What about, what do you think was the most challenging
(indiscernible) BUD/S, whether overall or single day or event?

Um, I I did I was the, when I felt like I was disliked was really
hard for me, uh, by by other students, by instructors, um, whatever.
When when I felt like, yeah, going back to the reputation piece. When
when I felt like my reputation, uh, was declining. That was really,
really hard for me to deal with and like it came in two: some sometimes
I felt like it was deserved, like I underperformed or like I did
something wrong or whatever and then I was ashamed or sometimes I felt
like it was undeserved and I was being targeted and and that pissed me
off. So like even in this scenario, I wasn’t good uh with letting what
other people thought about me kind of bounce off.

Yeah.

Like it really got to me.

So, um, how were you able to get through that? What
motivated you to push through that…?

Through that?

Through that kind of experience.

Um, people around me, uh, who know that. You know, would reassure
me. People people who know me well would would you know would talk to
me. Um and then the-the sense of humor bit I think like being able to
make fun of it -

Yeah

-really helped and laugh with other guys.

Now did you feel like you were supported by the group?

Yes

Your class?

Yes.

Were there any specific practices whether they were
physical mental spiritual that you utilized to progress through BUD/s?

Yeah. Uh, I would - I tried to journal every day at the end of the
day uh that was a really good release uh and I tried to be reading
something even if I couldn't get to it every night I would try to like
have something that I was working through like a book

What types of things were you reading? Like were they fun
things or were they like-

Yeah, I read I can tell you the books, I read Man’s Search for
Meaning in first phase, by Victor Frankl. Um I read-I was working
through a Bill Bryson book about 1927 and that was just likea fun read.
Uh I read starship troopers in third phase and then at the end I was
working through Legacy.

Okay

So non-fiction mostly

Yeah

Um just yeah just something to wind down with

Yeah, interesting. So um, wha-when you made a difficult
decision during training at BUD/s , what went through your mind? That
could be like an ethical decision, a moral decision...

Yeah um uh so we uh as officers we found out that a guy this was
in first phase after hell week, a class favorite a guy who was like
universally well regarded um we found out he cheated on an obstacle
course ran around the obstacles. Um and we had this meeting with just
the officers um a lot of people had seen him uh other people had failed
that obstacle course and were looking to maybe get rolled um in order
to- because of it. And guys had come up to officers like what are you
going to do about this? This is-this is not right. Um so we ended up
and-and we knew this guy had been to BUD/s before like I said he was a
leader in the class, he was a class favorite. We knew that if he was
turned in he’d be kicked out for his career uh and we uh we came to the
decision collectively that he had to turn himself in and that he had to
get kicked out of training. Uh and that was - that was really hard for
all of us because we thought like theres this reputation at BUD/s where
you take care of the guys around you and especially after hell week like
thats your crew you're in it as a team at that point and um you know no
matter what you've got your guys back um but we had to there was-there
was like only one right decision, we couldn’t - because if he had swept
it under the rug there were so many guys that saw it, someone would’ve
mentioned it, they would’ve found out we all would've been in trouble
anyway uh and then we would’ve got kicked out. Uh but then also the it
just wouldn't there would've been no way to spin that as the right the
right decision to let him cheat his way through an event that other
people failed and were facing the repercussions uh you know with honor
um so yeah that was that was really tough and it was right at the
beginning like we had jus- we were on such a high after finishing hell
week um so that was yeah that was tough.

Uh, why do you think you were successful at BUD/s?

Um, the two- the two reasons - I keep going back to this but the
two reasons that I came to BUD/s in the first place like the awesome
awesome guys and the low level of autonomy like I had no idea what level
of autonomy Im gonna have um if I make it the SEAL teams um but the
awesome awesome guys just spot on um spot on and the guys around me we
were successful as a-as a class because of each other and then also when
I took a step back and observed like what was going on around like I
realized how lucky I am and how awesome this this community is you know
versus others that I could be in um just based on the other guys that
were out there trying out with me so

Um, did you notice anything different about people who made
it versus those who didn’t make it?

Some. I think that the people that are still around just want to
be like I really think that the only thing that determines whether
you'll make it to the end or not is whether you want to. Um yeah if I
could be it into a sentence that’d be it. But then it seems like the
guys who- seemed like the guys who took themselves less seriously did
better um the guys that talked a big game usually weren’t around after
hell week um the guys that were lifting other people up rather than uh
y’know pushing others down, that was big one too; being a team player
even when it seemed like we were competing the whole time.

How’d this experience change you as a person?

Um, I mean I want to- I want to say that it didn't. Um maybe if
-if you revealed a few weakness to me that I didn’t know before I’d be
really sensitive to others opinions of me like I think I knew that
before but I don’t think I’ve been in a situation before this where
there were so many obvious negative opinions um so that so
(indiscernible). Again the ability to keep a good sense of humor and not
take things too seriously but I like to think I had that before too um
yeah.

Great, I’m finished with you. Congratulations.

Thank you.

Good luck on the next step

Thanks a lot. Good luck on this uh study.

It’s great. We appreciate you guys taking (indiscernible).
It's great stuff.

AND CO SAID I CHANGED MY MIND ON YOU BASED ON MY GUT FEELING, I CAN'T
REALLY EXPLAIN IT BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY, SO HERE I AM IN 338
INSTEAD OF THE FLEET. SO THATS BEEN A HUGE MOTIVATING FACTOR SINCE THEN
TO JUST BE UM DOING THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT I CAN EVERYDAY ITS LIKE A
HUGE BLESSING JUST TO JUST TO EVEN BE HERE SO I’M SUPER THANKFUL UH THAT
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE GONE IN MY [UNKNOWN] MOTIVATION BUT UM IT'S
DEFINITELY MOTIVATING TO TO HAVE SEEN THE OTHER SIDE AND BE BACK.

EVERY DAY TO THE POOL AND JUST CHARGED MY MASK AND WENT TO THE BOTTOM
CHARGED MY MASK AND SWAM LAPS UM JST KINDA PRACTICED SOME OF THOSE AS
BEST I CAN [UNINTELLIGIBLE] AS FAR AS I COULD. SAME THING FOR OC8 JUST
GET AS MANY REPS AS YOU CAN ALL DAY EVERY DAY

CDR: WAS THERE A CERTAIN POINT IN BUD/S WHERE YOU HAD TO MAKE A REALLY
DIFFICULT DECISION UM THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH UM BUT YOU WERE
ABLE TO GET THROUGH? LIKE IS THERE ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT?

UM SO THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE LIKE I-I KIND OF LIKE WATCHED
SOMEONE SKIP AN OBSTACLE ON THE O-COURSE AND HAD TO LIKE CONFRONT THAT
PERSON AND SAY HEY LIKE I DONT KNOW IF LIKE YOU SKIPPED THIS OBSTACLE OR
BUT THATS NOT COOL SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I LIKE REALLY STRUGGLED
WITH FOR A COUPLE DAYS UM BETWEEN ME AND A COUPLE OTHER STUDENTS THAT
HADN'T SEEN IT I JUST BOUNCED IDEAS OFF OF THEM AND HAD A GO ABOUT IT

CDR: SO YOU STRUGGLED WITH IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS SO YOU DIDN'T CONFRONT
THEM RIGHT AWAY?

NO, NO… UM

CDR: SO, WHAT MADE YOU CONFRONT THEM?

UM I THINK JUST THE JUST THE IDEA THAT IT'S A SMALL THING BUT IT'S
A BIG THING IF YOU KNOW FAIL AN OBSTACLE AND DON’T SAY HEY I FAILED LIKE
THAT IT KINDA CAME DOWN TO THAT OF LIKE ITS A SMALL THING IT'S JUST AN
OBSTACLE ON THE O-COURSE BUT IT'S A BIG THING IN THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY HEY I MESSED THIS UP UM YA KNOW
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU NOT WILLING TO DO?

CDR: YEAH. SO WHY DID YOU STRUGGLE WITH THAT DO YOU THINK?

UM, WELL THE MAIN REASON WAS BECAUSE HE UM IT WAS KIND OF-IT WAS A
CLASS THAT I’D JUST BEEN ROLLED INTO. SO IT WAS 337, I'D JUST BEEN
ROLLED INTO THAT CLASS. I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF RAPPORT WITH LIKE OTHER
STUDENTS UM AND THIS PARTICULAR STUDENT WAS ALSO LIKE A KIND OF A LEADER
IN THE CLASS HE WAS A FLEET RETURNEE HE'D BEEN THROUGH BUD/S BEFORE UM
SO IT WASN'T AS CUT AND DRY AS -AS JUST ONE OF MY PEERS

CDR: YEAH

IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT TO ME AT LEAST.

CDR: WHAT WERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL-
ABOVE LIKE ALL THESE OTHER GUYS THAT QUIT?

UMM I THINK EARLY ON [FIRST PHASE] JUST STAYING RELAXED TAKING
SMALL OPPORTUNITIES TO JUST RELAX AND UM KINDA TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND
CLEAR THE MIND AND JUST BE LIKE ALRIGHT I’M HERE, JUST RELAX FOR
EXAMPLE, ANYTIME WE WERE DOING SOMETHING AT COLORS AND STANDING AT
ATTENTION OR LIKE RUNNING BOATS, I WOULD JUST LOOK AT THE CITY OF SAN
DIEGO AND SAY, I AM HERE… ALRIGHT LET'S GO.

CDR: WHAT ABOUT THE GUYS THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT? THE ONES THAT ARE NO
LONGER HERE?

WELL, HUMM LETS SEE. A LOT OF THEM WERE REALLY FINICKY ABOUT BEING
COLD, OR BEING WET, THEY WOULD COMPLAIN A LOT- A LOT OF THEM WERE BIG
COMPLAINERS.

CDR: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU FEEL LIKE
HAS CHANGED YOU, LIKE WHAT PART OF YOU IS DIFFERENT FROM WHEN YOU WERE
IN BO?

DEFINITELY MORE HUMBLE. THIS PLACE HAS HUMBLED ME FOR SURE. I DON’T
KNOW ANYTHING UMM AND THAT HAS BEEN REALLY REALLY GOOD. UM I WOULD SAY
LOOK LEFT, LOOK RIGHT AT THE GUYS AROUND YOU, YOUR TEAMMATES- TO BE MORE
FOCUSED ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEM- LIKE HOW THEY ARE DOING, WHERE
THEY ARE AT, MAKES IT EASIER ON YOU. BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT
IS HURTING YOU.
SO UHH THE TIME IS 52, IT’S 10 FEBRUARY, THIS IS CDR LEDFORD. I’M WITH
PARTICIPANT 220 AND I’M GOING TO RECORD THIS JUST SO THAT WE CAN
TRANSCRIBE IT AND KEEP BETTER NOTES THAN WHAT I AM TAKING
HERE…[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

I’LL TRY AND SPEAK TO THAT, SIR I DON’T WANT YOU TO THINK I’M BEING
DISRESPECTFUL

YEP, NO NO. YOU SURE YOU GOOD WITH ME RECORDING?

YEP

SO KIND OF SOME SOFTBALL QUESTIONS, WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S CLASS?

339

339….

SO I BELIEVE WE WERE IN BO IN AUGUST

ALRIGHT, SO YOU MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.. UHH HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO
YOU HAVE?

I HAVE 1 OLDER BROTHER.

SO.. OLDER BROTHER, WHAT’S HIS AGE?

HE’S 27. AS OF 8 DAYS AGO, I MISSED HIS BIRTHDAY AND DIDN’T SAY HAPPY
BIRTHDAY.

HOW OLD ARE YOU?

I’M 25. I TURNED 25 ON THE ISLAND.

OH NICE, IT’S FUNNY I HAD MY BIRTHDAY ON THE ISLAND TOO. SO IT’S JUST
THE TWO OF YOU, WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED,
DIVORCED GROWING UP, WHAT..

MY MOM’S FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SHE UHH GREW UP OUT HERE IN LOS
ANGELES AREA AND THEN MOVED TO NEW YORK FOR WORK. SHE MOVED TO NEW YORK
FOR WORK AFTER COMPLETING GRADUATE SCHOOL IN THUNDERBIRD IN ARIZONA,
MOVED TO NEW YORK WAS WORKING IN BANKING AND THEN IN HER EARLY THIRTIES
UH SHE MET MY FATHER UH MY FATHER IS FROM UH ALL OVER THE PLACE HE GREW
UP IN LEBANON HE GREW UP IN IRAQ HE GREW UP IN SWITZERLAND, ENGLAND, UM
HE WAS ATTENDING FRENCH BOARDING SCHOOLS GROWING UP, BUT I’D SAY SWISS
BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE HE DID HIS PRIMARY SCHOOL EDUCATION, MIDDLE SCHOOL
EDUCATION, HIS SORT OF COMING OF COMING OF AGE WAS IN SWITZERLAND SO I
SAY HE’S SWISS..

AND WERE THEY MARRIED [UNINTELLIGIBLE] GROWING UP?

AND THEN THEY’RE YEAH MARRIED MY WHOLE LIFE, STILL ARE MARRIED

OKAY, AND HOW WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

WITH MY PARENTS?

YEAH

I WOULD SAY IT’S THE BEST RELATIONSHIP ANYONE COULD HAVE. I TELL THEM
EVERYTHING, TELL THEM MY DEEPEST FEARS MY BIGGEST TRIUMPHS, I SHARE
EVERYTHING WITH THEM UMM… WE HAVE A VERY OPEN RELATIONSHIP, MY PARENTS
ALWAYS SPOKE TO ME AS AN ADULT MY WHOLE LIFE NO MATTER WHAT MY AGE WAS,
THEY NEVER SPOKE DOWN TO ME, MY DAD… [INTERRUPTION FROM INSTRUCTOR] UM
MY DAD NEVER PICKED ON ME

ALRIGHT

UH I’M SORRY IF I’M GIVING YOU TOO MUCH INFORMATION,

NO NO THIS IS PERFECT

I’M JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE INFO DOWN BECAUSE I KNOW IT’S UH DO YOU
MIND IF I PULL IT JUST A LITTLE CLOSER?

SO THE RELATIONSHIP WAS VERY OPEN WITH YOUR PARENTS, THAT’S PERFECT.
WHAT UM LIFE-CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED TO YOU PRIOR BUD/S?

I AM A FAILED ENTREPRENEUR BEFORE I CAME IN. I SPENT ABOUT 2 OR 3 YEARS
STARTING A PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH A FEW BUSINESS PARTNERS
OF MINE WITH RANGING AGES FROM 55 YEARS OLD YA KNOW FROM LAWYER TO MY
MAIN BUSINESS PARTNER WHERE WE WERE 20 YEARS OLD. UH WE LOST OVER HALF A
MILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT FUNDS, UH WELL NOT LOST BUT SPENT AND UH
AND THEN AS THAT PROJECT WAS GOING DOWN AND I HAD TO ADMIT THAT TO
MYSELF, THE SEAL PATH SERENDIPITOUSLY ENTERED MY LIFE VIA FRIENDS,
CONVERSATION WITH A FRIEND WHO I WAS LIVING WITH AT THE TIME IN COLLEGE
WHO WENT TO NORWHICH, WHICH WAS A MILITARY ACADEMY IN VERMONT, AND HE
TOLD ME ABOUT THE SEAL PATH AND THAT DAY I WANTED TO DO THIS AND I HAD
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TELLING OUR INVESTORS THAT WE WERE CLOSING
DOWN SHOP. AT THAT SAME TIME, I WAS STARTING TO TRAIN FOR THIS AND IT
WAS TWO YEARS BEFORE I SHOWED UP. SO AFTER COLLEGE I MOVED HOME WITH
THOSE VERY OPEN PARENTS OF MINE WHERE I TRAINED FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A
HALF JUST LIVING IN NEW JERSEY TRAINING WITH THEM, LIKE TRAINING
LITERALLY AT THE END OF EVERY TRAINING DAY MY DAD WOULD ASK ME HOW FAST
DID YOU RUN HOW FAR DID YOU RUN AND HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOU LIFT, HOW
FAR DID YOU SWIM? HE WAS LIKE MY ACCOUNTABILITY GUY AND I WOULD HAVE
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT I DID PHYSICALLY TO PREPARE,
BUT THEN MENTALLY WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS, WHY I WAS GONNA MAKE IT AND
ALL THAT. I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM LITERALLY ON A NIGHTLY BASIS FOR
ABOUT A YEAR AND HALF AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT PREPARED ME. BUT YEAH,
EXPERIENCING FAILURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME EXPERIENCING WHAT AMAZING
THINGS CAN HAPPEN IF YOU DO STICK WITH THE PROJECT FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AT
A TIME, HOW FAR THE EVOLUTION CAN TAKE YOU, IT GAVE ME FAITH THAT OH MAN
IF YOU STICK THIS THING OUT IT WAS GOOD TO [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

SO WHAT WHAT THINGS ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS,
ABOUT YOUR PARTICULAR PERSONALITY?

I WOULD SAY FIRST, NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT I DID, THESE
THESE THINGS ARE GOD GIVEN GIFTS THAT I WAS BORN WITH THAT I WENT
THROUGH. LITERALLY DURING CHRISTMAS BREAK I WENT THROUGH A OLD PHOTO
ALBUM THAT MY MOM MADE OF ME WITH CRITIQUES FROM MY SUMMER CAMP DAYS
WHEN I WAS 8 YEARS OLD I’D BEEN THE SAME PERSON MY WHOLE LIFE, UM ALWAYS
ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE BUT ALWAYS WILLING TO HELP OTHERS. THIS IS
JUST WHAT IT SAID THIS IS YA KNOW THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT THE CRITIQUE
SAID WHEN I WAS IN SUMMER CAMP AS UH 8, 9, 10 YEAR OLD. WAS ONE OF THE
MOST COMPETITIVE, WANTED TO WIN THE MOST BUT AT THE SAME TIME WAS
WILLING TO HELP OUT THE KIDS THAT WEREN’T AS GOOD, SO I THINK THERE WAS
A HUMAN EMPATHY PIECE THERE, UM AND UH UH I DON’T I’M A DILIGENT PLANNER
SO UH I WOULD I WOULD LITERALLY KEEP NOTEBOOKS OF HOW I WAS GONNA WIN
CAPTURE THE FLAG THE NEXT SUMMER UMM AND THEN UM WHAT OTHER THINGS UHH
OH HERE’S A BIG ONE UM AND I KNOW IT’S IN YOUR EVALUATION OVER THERE ON
THE SURVEY MONKEY, BUT I WOULD SAY THE ABILITY TO BE VULNERABLE IS HUGE,
SO I REMEMBER DURING HELL WEEK HERE, AND I’VE BEEN LIKE THIS MY WHOLE
LIFE, SO EVEN IF YOU’RE ONE OF THE BETTER COMPETITORS OR MORE ATHLETIC
PEOPLE, I THINK IT WAS THAT ABILITY TO BE LIKE HEY GUYS I’M LIKE SCARED
RIGHT NOW I’M LIKE JACKED UP RIGHT NOW, THERE WERE SOME NEGATIVE
THOUGHTS COMING INTO MY HEAD AND I REMEMBER DURING HELL WEEK OUT HERE ON
MONDAY NIGHT I LITERALLY TURNED TO MY BUDDIES AND I WAS LIKE “I DON’T
KNOW WHAT’S HAPPENING, I THINK IT’S A PHYSIOLOGICAL THING, BUT MY MINDS
RACING RIGHT NOW AND LIKE I DON’T FEEL LIKE I NORMALLY DO I FEEL
TERRIBLE RIGHT NOW. I’M IN A DARK PLACE” AND JUST BY SAYING IT MY BUDDY
TURNS TO ME AND GOES “I’M IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE, I’M IN SUCH A DARK
PLACE” AND I JUST GO “ALRIGHT, NO PROBLEM” AND THEN ADMITTING IT GETTING
IT OUT THERE AND THEN SAYING SCREW IT I’M GONNA ATTACK THIS NEXT SURF
HIT OR THIS NEXT SURF TORTURE EVOLUTION, I LITERALLY GOT A SURGE OF
ENERGY THAT TOOK ME THROUGH THE NEXT FOUR DAYS OF HELL WEEK OR WHATEVER,
SO IT WAS THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR BUDDIES AND JUST ADMIT, AND
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF, AND I THINK HONESTY WITH ONESELF IS HUGE. LIKE
I I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST STARTED TRAINING I WAS LIKE I CANNOT DO
PULLUPS FOR SOME REASON MY DADS A MARATHON RUNNER I DON’T HAVE A VERY
LARGE BUILD OR WHATEVER I WAS LIKE I SUCK AT PULLUPS SO I WAS OUT THERE
DOING PULL UPS EVERY DAY FOR TWO YEARS OR WHATEVER, I HAD TO JUST DO IT
AND I STILL ON A PST THERE, CAN STILL ONLY GET LIKE 14 15 PULL-UPS WHICH
IS SORT OF ITS STILL AUTO-QUALIFICATION NUMBER BUT ITS ON THE LOWER END
WHERE AS THERE ARE OTHER GUYS WHERE ESPECIALLY [UNITELLIGIBLE] IF THEY
DID THAT THEY WOULDA BEEN DO 25 PULLUPS RIGHT SO HONESTY WITH ONESELF
PHYSICALLY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I USE TO I WAS IN BOOT CAMP I WAS LIKE “HEY
MAN HOW FAST ARE YOUR 4 MILE TIMED RUNS” “I DON’T KNOW” “WHAT DO YOU
MEAN YOU DON’T KNOW? WE’RE GOING TO BUD/S THERE’S A TEST GATE EVERY WEEK
THATS YOUR 4 MILE TIMED RUN TIME” I WAS OUT ON THE SAND IN BOOTS IN
BATES BOOTS THAT WERE A SIZE TOO BIG I WAS GETTING MYSELF FOR THE WORST
CASE SCENARIOS AND STILL HITTING THE TIMES AND HAVING… I’M NOT SAYING
I’M SUPER DILIGENT LIKE I DON’T LOG BUT I WAS KNOWING YOU JUST RAN 28
MINUTES YOU JUST RAN 27 MINUTES LIKE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT MY FASTEST 4
MILE TIMED RUN WAS BEFORE I GOT IN THE NAVY LIKE I STILL REMEMBER THE
EXACT TIME. SO AND THEN THE THE 2 MILE OCEAN SWIM WHAT’S THE FASTEST YOU
CAN SWIM 2 MILES I KNOW IT’S IN THE POOL IT’S NOT THE SAME AS THE OCEAN
BUT HOW FAST CAN YOU DO IT? “I DON’T KNOW” “WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T
KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT, LIKE UM I DON’T KNOW I WENT OUT HERE I DID
KOKORO CAMP, THE SEALFIT, SO IT WAS A 50 HOUR HELL WEEK SIMULATION SO I
KNEW THAT I COULD DO IT RIGHT, THEY SAY NO ONE QUITS AFTER FIRST PHASE,
WELL I GO AND DO THE PROGRAM OUT HERE AND I’LL DO IT FOR THE FIRST TWO
DAYS AND 50 HOURS OF IT AND WAS 30 PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP AND 9 PEOPLE
MADE IT AND I WAS JUST LIKE WELL OKAY THATS GOTTA BE LIKE SOME SORT OF
INDICATION OF SOMETHING LIKE I’M NOT LYING TO MYSELF I JUST WENT AND
WORKED OUT FOR 2 HOURS WITH GUYS THAT ARE LITERALLY INSTRUCTORS HERE
STILL, TWO OF THE GUYS THAT WERE, I CAN’T SAY THEIR NAMES BUT, SO I WAS
LIKE THAT’S GOTTA BE SOME SORT OF INDICATION, SO I THINK HONESTY WITH
ONESELF AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, GOING OUT TO LAGUNA I’M LIKE “OH WOW
I’VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO SHOOTING, GOT A LOT OF TACTICAL STUFF I
NEED TO WORK ON, I CAN BARELY USE A MULTI-TOOL, I DON’T KNOW HOW TO
CHANGE A TIRE, MY DAD IS A CONSULTANT LIKE HE NEVER TAUGHT ME ANY OF
THESE HARD HANDS ON SKILLS, SO ITS JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF LIKE
I SUCK AT THINGS I HAVE TO DO THIS

SO TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAD, DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SEAL
COMMUNITY, LIKE SEALS AS FRIENDS OR FAMILY, MILITARY FAMILY MEMBERS OR
FRIENDS?

I WAS THE LAST PERSON THAT ANYONE EVERY THOUGHT WOULD BE IN THE
MILITARY.

SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD UMM WITH YOUR PARENTS, HOW WOULD
YOU DESCRIBE THEIR PARENTING UHH STYLE, LIKE DID THEY DO TIMEOUTS,
WITHHOLDING TOYS, DID THEY SPANK, DID THEY WERE THEY DISCIPLINED, PRETTY
RELAXED

UHH SO I HAD TWO CHARACTERS, MY DAD WAS THE HANDS OFF GUY, AND THEN MY
MOM WOULD HIT ME, SPANK ME, THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I WOULD LISTEN, AND
I’M STILL THE SAME WAY NOW, I JUST GET SPANKED BY SEAL INSTRUCTORS. I’M
ALWAYS THE ONE FINDING MYSELF GETTING THE EXTRA REMEDIAL BEATING AT THE
END OF THE DAY BECAUSE I NEED SOMETHING TO BE BEAT IN OR ELSE I DON’T
REMEMBER, SO SPANKING THERE WAS NO OTHER WITHHOLDING TOYS OR UH IF MY
MOM WENT LIKE THIS OH I’M REALLY UPSET WITH YOU, I’M LIKE IS THAT IT, YA
KNOW I DON’T CARE.

UHH WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE UH CHILDHOOD TEENAGE YEARS DID YOU GUYS MOVE
AROUND A LOT?

NO, I LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE IN NEW JERSEY MY WHOLE LIFE, SMALL HOME
TOWN, PLAYED LACROSSE, HAD A BUNCH OF FRIENDS, RODE BIKES TO THEIR
HOUSE, THANK YOU GOD I HAD LIKE THE BEST CHILDHOOD OF ALL TIME, WE
TRAVELED THE WORLD ALL OVER

WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS UH DID YOU PLAY ANY TEAM SPORTS?

SO UH I PLAYED FOOTBALL, LACROSSE, UH FOOTBALL AND LACROSSE WERE ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE. I WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHERE I MEAN COME ON ONCE YOU GET
INTO HIGH SCHOOL AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU SAY AM I ABOUT TO PUT ON 30
POUNDS TO PLAY LINEBACKER OR AM I GONNA STAY AT 165 AND PLAY LACROSSE
AND PLAY MIDFIELD, SO I QUIT FOOTBALL AT A CERTAIN POINT AND JUST DID
LACROSSE. UM AND THEN I GOLFED MY WHOLE LIFE A GOLFER, SO I’VE GOLFED
SINCE I WAS A KID. AND UH I’VE SKIED SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID

UM SO WALK ME THROUGH THE 5 YEARS LEADING UP TO BUD/S, WHAT WAS LIFE

PITCH DECKS UH BUSINESS PLANS, WORKING WITH OUR LAWYERS MAKING SURE ALL

AND UM SO WE DID THAT FOR MY LAST FEW YEARS OF COLLEGE TO INCLUDE A
SEMESTER WHERE I STUDIED IN EUROPE, SO I STUDIED IN UH CZECH REPUBLIC MY
SENIOR YEAR FALL AND THEN UH FOR THAT LAST SEMESTER BECAUSE I HAD TO DO
AN EXTRA SEMESTER BECAUSE NONE OF THE CREDITS FROM KENYON CARRIED OVER
TO THE STATE SCHOOL BECAUSE UM KENYON CLASSES WERE [UNINTELLIGIBLE] A
THING AND SO SO THAT LAST BEFORE THAT LAST SEMESTER THAT SUMMER WAS WHEN
I WAS LIVING DOWN THERE BY MYSELF AND I WAS LIKE THIS COMPANY’S GOING
NOWHERE WHAT AM I DOING AND I MEET I MEET THIS GUY WHO WAS LIKE HE WAS
LIKE THIS IS WHAT I WANNA DO AND I WAS LIKE WHAT EVEN IS THAT AND HE
SHOWED ME AND LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY I CALLED MY FAMILY AND I WAS LIKE
ALRIGHT I HAD A LIFE CHANGE I’M DOING THIS I KNOW YOU GUYS DON’T BELIEVE
ME BUT JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

SO THIS IS THE SUMMER AFTER YOU GRADUATED?

THIS IS THE SUMMER BEFORE MY LAST SEMESTER BECAUSE I HAD THAT EXTRA FALL
BECAUSE OF THE FALL AT KENYEN SO IT WAS THAT SUMMER AND THAT’S WHEN I
STARTED TRAINING UH I HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR AWHILE BEFORE THAT BUT THAT
WAS THE SUMMER THAT I STARTED TRAINING AND THEN AND THEN AFTER I
GRADUATED IN DECEMBER, MOVED HOME, REALLY CLOSED UP SHOP WITH THE WITH
THE BUSINESS AND THEN WAS TRAINING FULL TIME AND THEN JOINED THE NAVY
WHEN I WAS 24.

SO HOW MANY HOW MANY YEARS WERE THERE BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH
CAROLINA AND WHEN YOU GRADUATED MINUS AND WHAT DID YOU DO FOR THE LAST
TWO YEARS?

IT WAS ALL THIS FULL TIME.

OH SO YOU WERE TRAINING?

I YEAH LIKE DECEMBER I GRADUATED DECEMBER 2017 WHICH IS BASICALLY 2018
BECAUSE IT’S DECEMBER OF 2017 AND THEN UHH SO FROM 2018 SO BASICALLY I
TRAINED AT HOME FROM DECEMBER TO THE NEXT DECEMBER, AND THEN IT WAS
APRIL, AND THAT’S WHEN I JOINED THE NAVY, SO LIKE A YEAR AND SOME CHANGE

SO BASICALLY A SEMESTER AT KENNEDY COLLEGE AND 4 YEARS AND UNIVERSITY OF
SOUTH CAROLINA, THEN YOU WERE BASICALLY TRAINING FOR BUD/S AND THEN YOU
CAME HERE?

YES. AND UH ITS KENYON K-E-N-Y-O-N K-E-N-Y-O-N YEAH KENYON

OH, PERFECT

DON’T KNOW WHERE THIS QUESTION CAME FROM HERE, SO WOULD YOU CONSIDER
YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UH WHAT DOES WHAT DOES THAT WORD MEAN? LIKE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON A WHIM?

YES, TO MAKE RASH DECISIONS.

UH I WOULD SAY WHEN I WAS A KID PROBABLY BUT NOW UH I WOULD SAY NO I
TEND TO THINK THINGS THROUGH AND UNDERSTAND TIME HORIZONS OF WHAT I’M
DOING

DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

NO

I ALREADY ASKED THAT

I’M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE IF IT COMES UP BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE
DEFINITELY NOTICE IN OUR CLASS. WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE THIS
QUESTION IMPULSIVENESS AND TATTOOS

I’M TRYING TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE IMPULSIVE DECISIONS

SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE MOST CHALLENGING EVENT AT BUD/S, LIKE WHAT
WAS YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S?

I WOULD SAY THE HARDEST THING ABOUT BUD/S WAS THE STRESS OF THE TEST
GATES. SO AT THE BEGINNING OF BUD/S IT WAS LIKE MAN I GOTTA GET UP AND
DO THESE REALLY PHYSICAL EVOLUTIONS. LOOKING BACK AT THAT, THAT WAS
REALLY STRAIGHT FORWARD, AND THAT WAS LIKE….[MIC MOVING] SO I WOULD SAY
AT THE BEGINNING OF BUD/S I WAS LIKE I KNOW I’M NOT GONNA QUIT SO I’M
GONNA GET UP AT 4 O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND I’M GONNA DO WHATEVER THEY
TELL ME TO DO AND THIS IS GONNA BE HARD AND I’M GONNA BE YA KNOW PUTTING
OUT BUT I’D SAY OVER THE LONG HAUL THE HARDEST PART WAS THE STRESS OF
THE TEST GATES, OH I HAVE THE SCUBA DIVING TEST GATE, I HAVE THIS NEXT
WEEK TEST GATE, I HAVE THIS SHOOTING TEST GATE. I CAN’T FAIL, I CAN’T
FAIL, AND AT TIMES AT BUD/S LIKE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET TO THE ISLAND,
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSING AND FAILING IS THIS

YEAH

IT’S LIKE INCHES, CENTIMETERS, LIKE A TRIGGER PULL AND YOUR BREATH
CONTROL, SO I MEAN I WOULD SAY IT WAS THE STRESS OF THE TEST GATES OVER
THE LONG HAUL THAT MAKES BUD/S THE HARDEST THING, IT’S LIKE HOLDING YOUR
CONTRACT IN FRONT OF YOUR PHASE THE ENTIRE TIME, CAN’T FAIL THE OBSTACLE
COURSE, CAN’T FAIL THAT TEST, CAN’T FAIL THAT TEST, YOU GET TWO SHOTS AT
IT IF YOU DON’T HIT IT YOU’RE.. IT’S LIKE THAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF
BUD/S

WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO KINDA PUSH THROUGH THAT, WERE YOU SUPPORTED BY THE
GROUP, WAS IT..

I HAD NO OPTION. I WAS NOT EVER GONNA GO TO THE FLEET AND THAT WAS NEVER
AN OPTION FOR ME. UH DURING BOOT CAMP I GOT A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT THE
FLEET WAS LIKE AND THERE WAS NO OPTION FOR ME. I MEAN, MY PERSONALITY
AND WHO I AM, IF YOU WERE TO COOP ME UP ON A SHIP FOR MONTHS ON END, I
LITERALLY THINK I’D BE A LIABILITY SO IUHH THAT THAT SCARED ME MORE THAN
ANYTHING I NEVER HAD AN OPTION HERE SO THIS WAS IT.

WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU FEEL LIKE DID YOU DO SOMETHING ON A DAILY BASIS,
PHYSICAL MENTAL SPIRITUAL, THAT HELPED YOU UH GETTING THROUGH?

I WOULD SAY THAT YOUR WHATEVER IS STORED IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS IS GONNA
SHOW IN BUD/S AND I WOULD SAY IT’S THOSE DAYS WHEN YOU’RE TRAINING AT
HOME AND YOU SAY “DO I DOG THIS RIGHT NOW, OR DO I GO HARD? DO I QUIT
THE RUN? OR DO I FINISH THE RUN?” AND I WILL TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT
IN MY ENTIRE TIME TRAINING I NEVER QUIT ONE TIME. I NEVER SAID I WAS
GONNA DO 100 PULL UPS AND DIDN’T DO 100 PULL UPS, I NEVER SAID I WAS
GONNA RUN 5 MILES AND THEN SAID OH YA KNOW WHAT 4’S GOOD ENOUGH. I DID
WHAT I SAID WHAT I WAS GONNA DO, EVERY TIME AND I WOULD SAY EVEN SOME OF
THE DAYS I WENT OUT THERE SAYING AND GUYS DO THIS IN THE PROGRAM ALL THE
TIME WE SAY HEY MAN LAST 4 MILE TIMED RUN OF BUD/S, WE’RE JUST GONNA
TAKE IT EASY, AND THEN I FIND MYSELF IN DEAD SPRINT TRYING TO GET A
PERSONAL RECORD. WE JUST DON’T HAVE THAT IN US, WE DON’T QUIT, WE DON’T
TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT, AND I WOULD SAY IT’S DUDES PREPARATION BEFORE
THEY GET IN, ARE YOU LYING TO YOURSELF? DID YOU ACTUALLY DO THE 4 MILE
TIMED RUNS OR ARE YOU LYING TO YOURSELF? AND WHAT WAS YOUR 4 MILE TIMED
RUN TIME? WHAT WAS IT? TELL ME RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU DON’T HAVE THOSE
HARD ANSWERS AND YOU WEREN’T HONEST WITH YOURSELF, I THINK THAT’S WHAT
SHOWS WHEN YOU GET HERE.

WHAT ABOUT DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT YOU EXPERIENCED HERE AT BUD/S UM DID
YOU HAVE A DECISION THAT YOU PARTICULARLY STRUGGLED WITH AT A CERTAIN
POINT, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING THEM IN FOR
CHEATING…

I WOULDN’T SAY THAT I HAD ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS. WE DID RUN PEOPLE OUT
AND I DID TELL PEOPLE TO QUIT BUT THEY WERE PEOPLE THAT I TRULY BELIEVE
DIDN’T HAVE THE GIFTS TO DO THE JOB, AND AGAIN A LOT OF THIS STUFF IS
GOD GIVEN, LIKE MY BUDDY BACK HERE ENS RODRIGUEZ HAS MORE GOD GIVEN
ABILITY THAN PROBABLY ANYONE IN THE CLASS, AND I ALWAYS RAN BOAT WITH
HIM OVER PEOPLE WHO I WAS LIKE THEY CAN’T BE DOING THIS.. I MEAN WE DID
RUN PEOPLE OUT BUT I DIDN’T FIND IT TO BE TOO HARD OF A DECISION.

WHAT WHY DO YOU THINK, I THINK I ALREADY ASKED YOU THIS ALREADY WHY DO
YOU THINK YOU’RE A SUCCESSFUL BUD/S STUDENT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY DO YOU
NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE WHO MADE IT AND DIDN’T, WHEN YOU
DESCRIBE THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT?

I NEVER SPENT TOO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON THE GUYS THAT I DIDN’T THINK
WERE GOING TO MAKE IT. I THINK SOME OF THEM DIDN’T HAVE THE THEY DIDN’T
HAVE THE GIFTS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY THEY JUST I DIDN’T THINK THEY JUST
PROBABLY NEVER HAD IT THEIR WHOLE LIVES, KINDA GOING OUT ON A LIMB
COMING OUT HERE, UM SO I THINK SOME GUYS DIDN’T HAVE THE GIFTS, AND THEN
I THINK SOME GUYS UM THEY JUST REALIZED THAT THE PIPELINE ITSELF WASN’T
RIGHT FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY FOR LIKE OFFICERS THAT QUIT, I THINK THEY
JUST REALIZED THAT I DON’T WANT TO DO THIS TYPE OF HIGH STAKES WORK.
HONESTLY I DIDN’T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON THE GUYS WHO WERE I
ALWAYS LOOKED AT THE GUYS WHO I KNEW WERE GONNA MAKE IT AND I HUNG OUT
WITH THEM ALL THE TIME AND I THINK CLASSES GET VERY CLIQUEY SO THOSE WHO
DIDN’T MAKE IT HUNG OUT WITH OTHER DUDES THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT, AND THE
DUDES THAT MADE IT, MY BUDDIES LIKE MY SWIM BUDDY I DON’T KNOW IF THAT
ANSWERS THAT QUESTION.

PERFECT. UM, HOW DOES THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON, YA KNOW
LIKE ARE YOU DIFFERENT?

I WOULD SAY MOST GUYS WOULD AGREE THAT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IS IN YOUR
LEVEL OF HUMILITY. I WOULD SAY THIS PROGRAM WILL HUMBLE YOU. IF YOU
THINK YOU’RE THE MAN COMIN IN, YOU’RE IN TROUBLE. OH AND IT’S NOT JUST
LIKE PHYSICAL ABILITIES AND STUFF, BUT IT’LL HUMBLE YOU IN A SENSE THAT
WE ALL REMEMBER A TIME WHEN GUYS SAID HEY I NEED 3 GUYS TO HELP ME OUT
RIGHT NOW WITH THIS VERY DIFFICULT TASK AND MY BOY GOES YEAH, WE’VE ALL
DONE IT, WE’VE ALL SEEN OURSELVES BE SELFISH, WE’VE ALL SEEN IT. YOU
HAVE TO STARE AT IT IN THE FACE EVERY DAY SO IT’S HUMILITY NOT JUST IN
THE PHYSICAL STUFF BUT IT;S HUMILITY JUST ALL AROUND, YOU JUST GOTTA GET
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] PERFECT

ALRIGHT, AWESOME, ALRIGHT, I THINK THAT’S ALL WE’VE GOT UM I REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT WAS SUPER SUPER HELPFUL

I REALLY HOPE SO, AND I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE MY RESULTS BACK

ALRIGHT, THANKS A LOT

And I'll ask again. Is it okay if I record?

Yes, it is okay to record.

Would you state your participant ID number.

ID number 228

When did you start your BUD/S class?

Uhh 339, I was here originally yeah. The OG crew. Only 18 of us or
something.

And is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yes.

Ok, can I ask about your family? Are you an only child do you have
siblings?

I'm the youngest of four. I have one older brother and two older
sisters.

So who...can you tell me birth order?

Yes uh....older sister, six years older, and a brother, four years
older, then a sister two years older. So...very organized family. Then
me.

Your parents married, separated, divorced?

Parents are married, never divorced.

How long have they been married?

Uhh...30 years I think this year.

Wow and how is your relationship with them?

Great. yeah ...yeah.

And relationship with your siblings?

Yeah. Yeah. I mean other than like bickering is we have really...really
close family I'd say, immediate family.

Have there been any life changing events that have happened in your life
prior to BUD/S?

I mean I ...I guess just going to college and everything like that.
[inaudible]

It seems like you got a 4 year degree?

Yes...yeah.

That was challenging or?

Uhm...yeah. Yeah. I was at the Naval Academy. So

Oh you went to the academy?

Yeah...I mean it was...yeah that was challenging I mean first few years
obviously are...weren’t super fun. But you know, that's why I wanted to
go there and that's why I enjoyed being there and because it was a
little bit of a different challenge than I think I would have had a
civilian school. So uh yeah, I'm not sure that I'd be here without it
probably wouldn't be here without going there.

So you thought it was like a crucible experience?

Yeah, yeah I’d say so.

And any other sort of singular events? Like anyone close to you or an
accident?

Uhh, no, there wasn't, I can't really think of any singular..

No major trauma?

No, nothing like...too traumatic or anything.

So do you think that the experience at the Academy factored into your
experience or success at BUD/S?

Yeah. Like I said, I'm not even sure if I would have decided to come
here...without having gone to the academy first. Just, you know, all I
knew about the SEAL teams before college was what you get from pop
culture, movies and books and stuff. Which I’ve come to learn doesn't
necessarily tell you what the actual careers like, but um, I was able to
learn more about that the Academy. I think...I don’t know...that's...it
kinda gave me a more indepth for being, or for wanting to be, than for
just wanting to have a cool job. So yes.

So beyond the Hollywood mystique. Okay, how do you think your
personality attributed to your progression through BUD/S?

I mean, I've just always been…like very competitive obviously and uh...I
guess I'm just always...slept better at night knowing I've like just
gave my maximum effort on whatever I was doing. Like, uh, I've run long
distance my whole life. Uh, I was never good at sports, but I was always
just good at...putting out I guess. Like just like working hard to get
better at something important.

So work ethic?

Yeah. So yeah...I guess that obviously contributed….Um yeah...BUD/S just
definitely I think it fit my personality very well…. Like I said about
the academy, I enjoy like having new challenges every day and BUD/S
definitely gives you that so.

So what led you into SEAL community for service selection. Did you have
friends or family or?

Yeah. I mean I always thought it'd be cool. Like I said to be a SEAL but
um...I’d say I had uh older teammates. I was on the Triathlon team at
school. Um a lot of them came here what are SEALs now and uh...they kind
of taught me more about the...pipeline I guess as they were going
through after graduating um keep in touch with them.

So you think they were role models and mentors also?

Yeah.

Helped you prepare?

Yeah, I mean just the team in general definitely helped me prepare cause
uh...team has a very competitive like...hard-working culture too. Uh...I
guess that's why this ends up being such a common choice for us. But
yeah...yeah role models.

So tell me about your childhood? So you had this great relationship uh
uh four...four kids. How were...describe your parent’s parenting style?
So were you spanked as a kid?

No, that's…

Free range parenting?

So...I guess one important factor is I grew up on a dairy farm. It's
pretty rural. Uh...but so my dad is a dairy farmer and my mom was a
teacher. Um...neither of them...believed in like spanking or anything
like that. The only time I think I was spanked was if I did something
that was...that was if they thought was like very dangerous. So if I
would cross the road without looking both ways, she said they would
spank me because they wanted to emphasize something like that. But...no
yeah my mom's never

So how did they discipline? Did they...like restrict privileges, take
away video games.

Um...I really don't remember them doing that very often. Honestly, the
one, the one thing that we always have to do as kids is uh like if we
were arguing with each other we have to sit on the steps and hold hands
until like whatever you were in at it with but um...yeah, I...I don’t
like remember getting like grounded.

So that left an impact. So that's, you remember that. What did that
instill in you?

Uh...I guess...I don't know, I guess maybe it taught me uh that most
arguments you have with other people are pretty, pretty fickle...and
uh... It's usually not worth the energy to just let your ego take over
to get mad at someone else, and you know cause problems because in the
end, you're all just going to be you're all just going to be holding
hands on the same playing field, anyway. maybe...maybe that's what it is
instilled in me.

For example, uh, did you move around through your childhood or teenage
years?

No, I grew up in the same house.

Same same dairy farm? Um same school system?

Yeah same town and everything. Parents still live there today.

So tell me about your teenage years? Did you do team sports or an
activity close to the Community like band or theater.

Yeah. I did a lot of stuff growing up throughout high school and
everything. It's another thing especially about my mom. Cause she
knew...being on a dairy farm. We were kind of...like she wanted to make
sure we experience more than just...being on a farm and going to school
I guess. So we did a lot of clubs growing up. I did um Boy Scouts. 4-H,
lots of different sports.

What kind of sports?

Well, I did...you know...everything growing up and then I really got
into cross country and track uh throughout High School. I wrestled for a
little.I guess it's probably important um I wrestled but I stopped after
my freshman year because I just wasn't enjoying it. Um...

That was one year that you did it?

I did it for three years. Uh so Junior High and first-year high
school...and then I got injured so I just made the decision to stop
that.

But you stayed with cross-country and track through graduation?

Yeah through graduation.I also, uh, did club cycling. [inaudible]

And so in the last five years before starting buds. What did you do?
Straight out of the academy?

Yeah, so...finished high school in 2015, went straight to the academy.

So no gap year?

No.

Would you consider yourself impulsive? So do you have any tattoos?

Oh, no, I'm not impulsive with life-changing decisions like that.

Speeding tickets, uh purchases?

No, I don't have any speeding tickets...no.

So you said yes originally?

Because like I don't stop myself from like getting candy at the checkout
of a grocery store. Not impulsive in that sense, but no not with life
changing decisions like that. It's a uh...I definitely think I think
about the long-term quite a lot. Uh…

So you’re thoughtful?

Yeah.

Analytical in your decision-making.

Usually, yeah. But then like I said, I also just, I like to do
spontaneous things too. But...I feel like I'm pretty good at discerning
things that will affect my future and things that yeah.

Was was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is a holistic
questions so you can think about the hardest day, hardest event. Is
there a theme throughout that really…?

Yeah...well…

Some guys are like the water. Some guys are like logs. Some guys are
like the runs.

Yeah...well...I’m trying to think. Well, I'll give like...I'll say
diving. I really just didn't like that was that was as the pretty a
pretty challenging…

What about it that made it so hard.

Uh...just the not...There's so many variables like things that could go
wrong. I thought... Plus I just like the first dive that I did with uh
or first night dive,I guess. I screwed up really bad. So it kind of made
me fear for the rest of them that I would you know make the same
mistakes. So I think maybe that, maybe that contributed to it. I would
just get really nervous.

So what motivated you to push through that fear?

I mean just, just like anything here. Like just gotta get over it.
Uh...you know get comfortable. It's cliche, but get comfortable being
uncomfortable. Yeah, and I, I also knew that the more I...just force
myself to like get through the dive and the better more comfortable and
confident I would be. Which is true, you know because I was fine with
diving by the end. I was just kind of tired of being cold and wet
but...but in terms of actually knowing how to dive, I think I got much
better by the end.

So that sounds like self talk like an internal…

Yeah

...position you found. Did you also feel supported by the team with
external factors?

Oh, yeah. I mean...I mean, I guess that's another common theme, I think.
When everyone else is doing the same thing. It's like well if all my
friends can do it, I can do too.

Solidarity?

Yeah, solidarity.

So do you have any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that you use
to push through the challenges? So some guys say they have prayer, or
meditation, or mantra, or visualization exercise? Some athletes will
have a warm up routine that they...

Uh...No, I can't really think of any routine things I do like that.
Um...I guess I...I guess I kind of have a mantra that...uh I’m trying to
think. I dont know how I word it but... basically like everything like
this will end. I guess I say this will end. Because...I've learned I
learned pretty quickly I guess in first phase. No matter how bad
something sucks. If you're in Surf torture or doing logs or whatever
like it's not going to go on forever. You're going to get out of the
water and you’ll warm up pretty quick because you'll run, you’ll run
around somewhere or you're going to be done with logs and be fine.
You’ll go to lunch or whatever [inaudible]. Just got to get through it,
everything ends. Like now BUD/S will end. It's all finite, so.

So think about when you made the decision during training at BUD/S, but
what went through your mind as you made that decision and it could be
example of a decision that you really struggled with.

A decision during BUD/S.

Yeah like, running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate.

Hmm.

Or deciding to go to medical?

I’ve never been to medical. I'll go with running classmates out. It was
a long time ago i guess. Trying to freshen that in my mind. Yeah. I mean
you kind of under the, under the boats, it gets pretty intense. Kind of
let your animal brain take over again. So I think uh that's something
you have to think about before an evolution like that starts. Using
uh...your human brain. Uh, I knew going into it that the...whole point
of BUD/S is like...to be able to support your team like being able to
sacrifice your for teammates something to prove that you want to be
here. So I wasn't afraid like if I knew there was a guy who...wasn't
willing to like...feel a little pain, or sacrifice a little to help the
rest of the boat crew that I wasn't didn't really have any problem
running him out.

Did you feel like you had this awareness of your animal brain having
that take over and you were able to then..sort of suppress it and tap
back into that cognitive reasoning.

Yeah, I think so. I mean, I wouldn't say I'm an expert.

It’s a super power.

Okay, maybe I don't yeah. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. I mean,

I just it's called mindfulness.

Yeah, I think about that stuff a lot. Okay, so I'm not yeah, I'm no
expert at it. But yeah, I'd say aware of it.

Okay. Then why do you think that you were successful completing BUD/S.

Honestly, I just think...I mean for me there wasn't really any question
of whether I'd make it from the very beginning. Uh, to think it's just
like...not that I knew it would be challenging but I knew like all my
friends have gone through this before and I know they're not superhuman
know lots of guys have done [inaudible] superhuman and I knew it like
it's not like I had any other back-up plan. So this is just what I was
going to do. I don't...I never really I still to this day don't
understand why guys make the conscious decision to quit. But... I don't
know. For me that was never really like what I was worried about so...I
guess, is that a good answer.

My next question is then what about those guys that dropped? What is it
that they didn't have that they…

Like I said, I really don't honestly don't understand it because to me
like going back to, so that Mantra like I don't like one of my friends
quit during surf torture of hell week shaking because it was cold or
whatever. But to me, it's like why don't you just put up with ten
minutes of shivering like literally for a career that will change...that
will be your life for the next 10 years or more. So I guess maybe that…

They don't have that perspective...

Yeah, having a broad perspective I guess. Yes.

Has this experience changed you as a person.

Yeah, probably. I mean...I mean just the just going through it. You
learn about a lot about different weaknesses you have whether like
they're specific skills uh...or competencies that, that they try to test
here. Like for me I realized I wasn’t great with like the diving at
first, like I said...in first phase I went to the third try of
life-saving which I wouldn't...wouldn’t have thought to mess something
like that up.

So it exposed your weaknesses to you. Do you feel any more confident?

Oh, yeah, but then it also shows like even though I was anxious about
those things at first now I could do them without batting an eye. Like
uh...yeah just shows. You're capable of a lot more than you think I
think you are. Like I think I was pretty confident before coming here
like that kind of stuff. I always like to challenge myself. But...yeah
this really solidifies that point that...just you or anyone else can do,
stay awake for five days or put up with a lot more pressure than you
thought you could so...makes me a lot more confident.

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think would
be any questions we should be asking.

Uh...no. Seems like a pretty thorough interview.

Okay, great. So I'm going to stop.

Is it okay if I record?

Yes

okay great. And if you could tell me your participant ID number?

233

awesome. When did you start your BUD/S class?

Oh 339 originally.

So youre the OG?

Yes

And is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yes

Can I ask you about your family? Are you an only child? Do you have
siblings?

I have a younger sister.

You're the oldest and then you have

I’m the oldest and then a younger sister.

And how much younger is she?

She's 20, so she's 3 years younger.

And your parents are married, divorced, separated.?

They’re married.

How long have they been married?

They've been dating since they were in sixth grade. And I think they
have been married 30-something years….married at 21, both around 58 now.
Whatever that is.

And then how’s your relationship with them?

Good.

And then with your sister?

It's good, too.

Talk to them often?

Um, I mean not all the time but milestones from Nicole text my sister
every now and then.

And then are they’re any life-changing events that happened to you prior
to BUD/S?

Nothing that like really stands out. No.

Did you go to college?

I did go to college. I went to NC State University.

All four years you graduated.

All four years graduated.Um...yeah really enjoyed it. And then came out
here right after.

Any, any....we’re just looking for, it could be a positive experience
like graduated college and could be, did you do a gap year? A mission
year?

I didn’t do a gap year or anything, I packed Europe twice by myself.
That was a something.

Two different…

Two different times. Yeah. First time was in...high school. After my
junior year. I had a neighbor that worked for United, who got me on
their fit list. Just went over there by myself. Worked on a farm in
Scotland. Found em on Craigs List. Worked in Scotland, made enough money
to buy a plane ticket to Germany. And like traveled all over there. And
then went again. Um in college.

So thats an impeccable experience.

Yeah, I guess thats impeccable.

Yeah, how did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?

Um I think mainly, uh, just like independence probably. Um. No,
expectations and figuring stuff out on my own. Uh. Never planned out
anything when I was traveling on the show up to a country, find a place
to sleep, figure out how to get to the bathroom. Yeah. Yeah get out of
the train station. Um….yeah, just...Never really like had like long
plans just kind of day to day. And day to day is pretty important to
BUID/S.

Were there any disasters? Did you have any traumatic events?

I don't really get that worked up about stuff maybe would have been
traumatic for other people. I mean like that stranded like in Germany
one time...missed a train and I had to sleep on like the platform. Yeah
stuff like that. Nothing crazy traumatic.

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression
throughout BUD/S?

I think I’m pretty relaxed? Uh uh I don't get too riled up too easily. I
think um...Just staying level headed through BUD/S is pretty important
for me. Um instructors can get to some people and nothing really ever
bothered me.

Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL Community. Did you have any SEALs as family or friends?

No um...growing up I don't know SEALs...I don’t really remember how I
like discovered them. But when I was in High School I pretty much knew
thats what I wanted to do. Um I wanted to enlist out of High School, but
my dad was like no you need to go to college. Cause he was enlisted.
Um...

So you can’t remember what sparked your original interest but you just
always had this High School goal.

My parents always said like when I was younger like they like what let
me have like toy guns or anything. So I would just make my own and
they're eventually just like all right, we'll give in. I was...I always
wanted to be an army man. And that just kind of evolved to be discovered
this and being like that’s what I want to do.

And your dad said why don't you hold off?

I actually came and went to like a commissioning Source. He was enlisted
and just he didn't like I was like the first male my family or college.
He wanted me to be that guy that that went to college and did that. I
guess he wasn't treated very well on the enlisted side so he wanted me
to go O. I wanted to enlist and so he made a bet with he was like
alright if...you apply for this scholarship, and if you get it you gotta
go, if you don’t you can enlist. I got the damn thing. Yeah, I got...did
ROTC which in hindsight, I'm very glad that where I'm at now. But…

So tell me a little bit more about your childhood and their parents
parenting style. So were you spanked as a kid?

Yeah.

Free range parenting?

Yeah yeah, I got spanked for sure. My dad was pretty…

Was there a belt or a paddle?

Yeah. Yeah, every time my dad would spank me and then he’d like give me
a hug after. It was interesting. Be all scary do the spanking and then
after give me a hug and be like its settled, you paid your dues or
whatever.

Did you feel like there was a why behind it?

Oh, yeah anytime I got spanked it was, definitely a why behind it.
Definitely deserved it. I guess...

And then as you got older was there restriction of privileges. Did they
take away your video games, your phone, your car?

No well actually grew up with no TV or anything.... So we're um...forced
to be outdoors for entertainment. Um. Got like a flip phone in High
School. And uh…

So minimal tech?

Yeah...um...yeah there's really nothing like this taking stuff or
whatever. Um they wanted me to be pretty independent once I got into
high school. Um.

Yeah, and did you move around a lot during childhood or teenagers years?

No. I was born in Anchorage, Alaska and then we when I was five we moved
to Virginia and I stayed there until I was out of school.

So Alaska til 5 and then…

Stayed in Virginia, and I went on Texas State. My whole family is from
North Carolina and in college my parents moved back to North Carolina.
But…

So they were close while you were in college.

Well four, four hours away in Nashville but yeah. It ended up, it ended
up being like the same distance. Driving to Virginia compared to where
they lived in North Carolina.

So I guess we're trying to get at here is did you feel like you were
uprooted and moved around in schools and social groups? You felt like
there's a pretty consistent pretty consistent…

Pretty consistent.

So tell me about your teenagers years, did you participate in a team
sport or an activity with the tight-knit community? So like band or
theater.

I, I wrestled my whole life...and played football...wrestling is
definitely my favorite sport.

Anything?

I was in band in Middle School just cause it was required.

So what did you do with the last five years prior to BUD/S? So you
commissioned right out of ROTC.

Came straight here.

Okay, you didn’t take a gap year or anything after high school? It was
high school into college.

High school right into college.

And would you consider yourself impulse?

Uh yeah, I guess so. I mean…

I mean like do you have any tattoos? I don't know…

Yeah, I've got a tattoo on my ass that I got. Um…it's just like a wolf
holding a beer...um not. I told somebody that I would do it when I was
drinking and then man of my word so woke up and had to go do it.

Okay. Like speeding tickets or?

Never gotten a speeding ticket.

Big purchases or anything? How do you make your decisions? Do you
typically think about them and plan them out now or do research or you
just more like go with my gut?

Yeah I just, day to day. Um... I was like, yes, I think you guys will
like this. I wrote about this for my SOAS application...like as a
turning point in my life. Um...I think I was in like 8th grade or ninth
grade. And I'd like...I was like pretty like straight arrow in school. I
didn't do anything...like crazy, I don't know crazy, but like just walk
the line. My dad like brought me one day and was like you need to get in
trouble this week at school. Like you need to go to the principal's
office and do something. Yeah, I did, and so I did and it was really
weird and from then on I just kind of live my life as like not scared to
get in trouble kind of thing. And...and its definitely changed the way I
do stuff. And he wasn’t like go and do something so bad that like you
know...But I knew what he was saying. It...It was cool.

He wanted you to push your comfort zone.

So I went and like played a prank on a teacher...and I got sent to the
principal's office. It was completely harmless and funny but...yeah.

What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is kind of a
holistic question. So it could a particular event, or a certain day, it
could be something as broad as water or logs.

I think the most difficult part about BUD/S is the first 15 minutes
waking up everyday. Other than that nothing is too challenging.

What do you mean?

Cause BUD/S is just such a grind of day to day. Getting up and…having
another day of BUD/S I think...that...once you get out of bed, and those
first 15 minutes are over...You’re with the boys and...nothing is that
bad. Everything is doable. And then getting up in the morning is the
hardest part.

Ok so what motivated you to get up and...actually get dressed and…?

I mean for me this is what I want to do. And I had to get up and get
dressed and do that. And um...just I dont really know. But I know those
first 15 minutes in the morning when that alarm is going off is the
hardest part. You know its like...here we go. Another day.

So is it like a self talk that you have with yourself?

Yeah. yeah definitely. Just like come on we gotta do this. And as like
an officer, you gotta be an example. I’d be in the room with a bunch of
other guys and they like see that you’re getting up um first one out of
bed….But I think that..that getting up is the hardest part.

So do you have any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that you use
to push through those challenges? So some guys say they have prayer, or
meditation, or mantra, or visualization exercise? Some athletes will
have a warm up routine that they do.

Um... I pray but I don’t pray like every, everyday...but for like big
events I’ll send up a prayer. Um I do more like meditation. Just like
really...like mental reps. Tons of test gates at BUD/S. And I’ll somehow
I’ll just dream about doing like OC-8 or pool comp or something just
over and over.

You call it mental reps?

Yeah just like mental reps

Like a visualization?

Yeah visualization.

And did you, were you taught that here.

I’ve just always. Anytime its something like that, like a big event
coming up...I’d always just do mental reps of whatever it was just over
and over in my head just to make sure it was good to go.

Did you ever make a difficult decision during training at BUD/S? And
what went through your mind with that decision? And can you give me an
example of a difficult decision?

Difficult decision in BUD/S?

So for example running a classmate out or turning in a cheating
classmate or maybe a decision to go to medical. You know and risk
getting rolled.

Fortunately I’ve never ever stepped into medical here. Um, but running
guys out of boats...I never really thought that was a [inaudible]
decision. Um...that almost comes down to these guys are hurting my boat
crew these guys are hurting my boys...you need to leave. Um...Its always
about what’s best for the group.

Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?

Um...I think I just wanted to do it. Every, everyone that I’ve
seen...not make it, they didn’t...they didn’t really...you have to just
want to be here. No...not get stuck with...the little day to day tasks
can eat away at you and just have a sight of the big picture.

The next question is did you notice anything about those who dropped,
who didn’t make it?

Yeah. I have, I actually had a workout group at NC State and uh 7 of us
have gotten through and pretty good success rate and this last class we
had a guy DOR for the first time out of our whole group. And he’s like
oh yeah I’ll just got EOD. And like the second you have any other option
besides completing this training, you are not going to complete it. So I
think that’s…

So they allowed themselves to entertain a plan B.

Right. Whereas for me it's like, yeah theyre are theoretically i guess
plan Bs but... they were never really an option.

How did this experience change you as a person? Has it changed you as a
person?

I dont think that it really has changed me a person. I think that I have
like new experiences that maybe provide me different perspective
on...other people, I’ve learned a lot about other people just by
observing people go through BUD/S but...I don’t think I’m any tougher or
any different after going to through BUD/S...I might even be a little
bit softer.

You are the second person to say that. Interesting. Is there anything
that we haven’t talked about that you think would be helpful in our
search to understand this idea of grit and resilience and hardiness and
mindfulness in what would make a successful candidate in the future?

Yeah...um...I don’t know I think its just...its all mindset. I have seen
some guys that are animals like just physically...studs that quit. And
then I’ve seen guys that are not, and they make it through with no
problem. I think it just literally comes down to your mental attitude
and desire to want to be here….I was never an amazing athlete, um, and
then they’re are guys in here that are D1 athletes and they’re guys in
here that have never played a sport before. And they all have a similar
desire to want to be here. And I think that's what it is.
IT IS 0825 ON 10 FEB, CDR LEDFORD AND I AM UHH WITH PARTICIPANT NUMBER

    THE HARDEST PIECE WAS? UMM PROBABLY HELL WEEK, I WOULD SAY THE
    SURF TORTURE ON DAY 1 OF HELL WEEK THAT WAS THE DARKEST MOMENT I

        BUDDIES CHRIS DUNN BEING ONE OF THEM AND WE WERE TALKING TO

  WHAT ABOUT UMM PRACTICES? DID YOU HAVE ANY DAILY PRACTICES UH
        LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL THAT HELPED YOU DEAL WITH THE
        CHALLENGES. THE ONE DAILY PRACTICE THAT WAS CONSISTENT FOR ME

        LOCK IT IN MY CLOSET EVERYDAY AND THAT WAS MY THING I WOULD
        LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY MORNING WAS MY CUP OF COFFEE. LAUGHS,

        BIBLE EVERY NIGHT THAT WAS MY LITTLE THING AT THE END OF THE
        DAY THAT KINDA KEPT ME GROUNDED AND THAT I COULD LOOK FORWARD
        TO.

DO YOU THINK ABOUT ANY KIND OF DECISION YOU HAD TO MAKE WAS THERE A
    DIFFICULT DECISION THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH GETTING THROUGH
    BUD/S? MHMM SO SORTA LIKE RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING IN A
    CHEATING CLASSMATES, ANYTHING YOU REALLY HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH. UMM
    NO, I HAVEN’T BEEN FACED WITH ANYTHING LIKE THAT YET. I GUESS ONE
    IS WHEN WE DO TOP FIVE BOTTOM FIVE AND BEING HONEST IF SOMEONE IS
    YOUR PAL AND THEY ARE NOT A GOOD PERFORMER DO YOU REALLY THINK
    THEY ARE BOTTOM FIVE. THAT WAS TOUGH FOR ME A COUPLE TIMES. BEING
    HONEST ABOUT THAT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL AT BUD/S? MAN THAT’S SOMETHING
    I WOULD ATTRIBUTE TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS I HAD A REALLY GOOD
    TRAINING BUDDY AT MERCHANT MARINE THAT WENT EOD. I HAD A MENTOR

    SPIRITUAL AND A PHYSICAL MENTOR IF YOU WILL. UMM COLLEGE LACROSSE

    THINGS, THEY CAME UP WITH AN EXCUSE FOR WHY THINGS WEREN’T UP TO
    PAR.

HOW DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? UMM I
    THINK IT SHOWS YOU THE THINGS YOU ARE CAPABLE OF. ANYTHING ELSE. I
    ALSO THINK IT HUMBLES YOU IF YOU DON’T HUMBLE YOURSELF AND IT WILL
    SHOW YOU WHAT YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT AND IT WILL EXPOSE YOU WHETHER
    ITS YOUR CLASSMATES CALLING YOU OUT, AN INSTRUCTOR OR AN EVOLUTION
    YOU FAIL. ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK THAT HELPED OR HURT YOU THAT YOU
    THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING ABOUT? UMM NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.
    AWESOME, ALRIGHT THANK YOU THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. LETME SEE THE
    (UNINTELLIGIBLE) THAT WE ARE GOING TO WRITE. ALRIGHT, THANK YOU.

Do I have your permission to record?

Yes,

OK. And if you would say your participant ID number.

240.

So when did you start BUD/S?

I started BUD/S...in lets see, I shipped out to boot camp April 1st. I
believe BUD/S would have started somewhere early September.

What was your class?

339.

And now you’re in?

339.

So you started in 339, and you are in.

Yeah gold original.

The OG?

The OG.

Is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yes.

OK, so can we talk about your family, do you have brothers and sisters?

Yeah. One sister, she is about eighteen months younger than me….Mother,
father.

So just the two of you and your sister. So you are the oldest, are your
parents married, separated…

Married.

Ok, whole time?

Yeah married whole time.

Ok so so how many years.

Um….let's see like it's got to be going on 37, 38 now.

Wow.

Yeah, a long time.

And what's your relationship with them.

Awesome. Yeah. Awesome role models talk to them almost every day.

OK. And good relationship with your sister?

Yes.

Any life changing events that happened in your life prior BUD/S.

Prior to BUD/S….um...aside from just having kind of like the one off
relative pass away, which was a grandparent, no, I haven't had anything
that, that has been kind of life changing. I would say.

So losing a grandparent was hard?

Oh, yeah, it was hard. Yeah, I grew up with them, um...

Grandfather?

Grandfather, yeah...uh but no, nothing really was that life changing.

That's was that traumatic or natural causes?

Natural causes yeah.

Kind of expected, sad but expected?

Yeah exactly yup

Ok...Do you think that those experiences, any experiences that factor in
your experience at BUD/S?

Um....as far as the life events, no, I don't think so.

High school? Junior college?

Yep. I went to high school and then played football in
college,um...played local here.

I would say that was probably more just kind of being a lifelong athlete
was more, I think, kind of the hinge point for, for coming to BUD/S and,
and doing well here.

And what college did you play football for?

At the University of San Diego.

Is that it would be D....?

It would be D1AA..

Position?

Defensive end.

And how do you think your personality contributed to your progression at
BUD/S?

Um…

Do you know what I mean when we say personality?

As far as character traits and…

Yeah. so exactly what traits, like introversion, extroversion,
consciousness, uh openness, agreeableness, neuroticism.

Um...I would say I'm probably a little more introverted. As far as like
being outspoken and being kind of like a leader. I’m sort of just like
hitting the follow button for BUD/S and...and being coachable. Just
kinda...do what I’m told...you know pass test gates. Um...yeah. Really
not trying to do anything like really out of line or anything like that.
Sort of...follow the natural progression. Phase to phase.

Um...sense of humor?

I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I think, I think my friends would
say so too.

But are you like the jokester in the group or you just…?

Definitely not the jokester. But, but the sense of humor is huge here.
Yeah. You definitely need that.

Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL community. So do you have any SEAL family, friends?

Sure, yeah, yeah. Um...so I was first introduced to the SEAL teams in
high school. I have a buddy who's currently on a SEAL Team. Um...

Friend from high school?

Friend from high school yes. And then uh...went to college...uh played
with a SEAL who had walked on our football team after his SEAL career
was done. He was around 31, 32. Uh, yeah, it's pretty cool actually.
Like ESPN did a whole story on him, so kind of got reintroduced back
into the teams that way. And then just being in San Diego, you hear one
off instances of like the SEAL teams and what they do and um...graduated
from college, worked in accounting for a number of years before
eventually deciding to, to join the teams. I sort of just missed that
like team environment and the whole brotherhood aspect and meeting like
a great group of guys. Like...it's definitely true that like you do this
reason for the guys. I would say so. So they kind...overall that’s what
led me back to BUD/S.

Ok so it does sound like...like some close contact, and then role models
and mentors.

Yeah...definitely.

OK, so tell me about your childhood. We're looking here for discussion
of your parents’ parenting style.

OK.

So like were you spanked? Was it free range parenting? Was it like would
they take away your video games, car privileges or phone? Yeah, like how
to discipline?

Yeah. Uh...so my family, my parents were pretty strict. Um...always went
to school, came back, did my homework, check, would check my homework.

Do you remember being spanked?

Uh yeah. I was yup, i was yup, spanked. I would get the belt sometimes.

Spoon?

No, no spoon...but um yeah definitely that and I would say was probably
equal on both sides, both mom and dad. But yeah strict yeah.

And then as you got older…?

They've chilled out a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's kind of cool um...but
yeah they're definitely way more relaxed and yeah. Just kind of hanging
out.

And did you move around throughout your childhood or teenage years?

Nope. Born and raised in same town.

Same town?

Um...Stockton, California.

And same house?

Same house.

Same school, like you didn’t have to move around schools or anything?

Nope.

Tell me about your teenage years. You mentioned sports, so that was
football through high school?

Yeah, teenage years I...are mostly characterized, I would say, by
sports. Just I would...

Any sports besides football?

Yeah, football, basketball, track...baseball.

And these are team sports teams?

Team sports yeah.

Um...so you enjoy not just the actual sport on the field, but the group
cohesion?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, all my best friends are...all played sports with me at
some point, yeah.

So you...for the last five years before BUD/S how many years were you in
the accounting career?

Uh...last five years. So...I graduated in 15 and then I worked in
accounting from 16 to...uh...towards I think like the end of 2017. And
then I moved back in with my parents and um trained until shipping out
in twenty nineteen.

And then you train for two years.

Yeah.

And what did that training consist of?

Uh...it was mostly running, swimming. So I would wake up, I would go
swim in the morning, um... run sort of around midday, and then the late
day would have some sort of like stretching or weightlifting session.
And I did that for the extent of about the time that I was home. Yeah.

Any...because it sounds so physical, any mental, spiritual exercises
that you were doing during that time?

Uh...no...I've never really been one for religion. Uh... mental
exercises, no, I never...never really did any like meditation or
anything. I think just the only sort of like constant pressure, I guess
I would feel is like, you know, hey, you're still living with your
parents or like you're living with your parents. You got to, like, start
making moves and get out. And so I think that was always kind of like,
OK, when am I going to enlist and ship out and do all that? I had always
known that I was going to come here, but you just kind of like getting
the ball rolling as, as, as far as life progression probably the only
really mental thing that I was dealing with.

So when you were playing football in college, did you ever work with
sports psychologist or anybody who had that mental training, overlayed
with your physical training. Did they do visualization exercises?

No, they had none of that. Yeah, I think as far as that stuff, it was it
was more honed on, like actually just being in sports. I think like
personally for me, I know I, I try to do a lot of that stuff
subconsciously, but it's like I'm not really thinking about it. But I
think we all kind of do that. But as far as training, specific training,
no, I've never had that.

Would you consider yourself impulsive? For example do you have any
tattoos you got on a whim?

Yeah. The tattoo question. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't consider myself
impulsive.

Speeding tickets?

Nope.

Any big purchases?

Mmm...aside from, like a laptop?

Yeah.

Or something like that?

See a car and buy it.

No. No, no, no.

You tend to be more analytical in your decision making?

Yeah. Yeah, sure. Definitely.

What was the most challenging part of BUD/S? So it could be a particular
day, it could be water or logs?.

Yeah, I think for me it uh would have been second phase, OC-8 test.
Because I went… uh to my third attempt on that. So that was probably the
hardest part of BUD/S. Um...and then…

What was it that made it so challenging?

I think it was just I hadn't had the procedures down uh flat and so my
first test was kind of rough. The second test went a lot better. Still
failed that one. So then the third test, I finally got it. But
um...yeah, more procedural based on that one. Um...on the island, just
working all day, every day. That was a grind.

So what motivated you to push through that grind and to go back to that
OC-8 test the third attempt?

Yeah.

Keep going?

Uh...I think I had just like...didn't want to leave my friends. I had
come so far. Like, I've invested just a lot of time into this whole
this, this whole pipeline. And I think the more I get into it, the more,
you know, obviously the more skin that I'm putting in. And so at this
point, it's like I'm sort of all in and it just kind of snowballs. You
don't...you know, it's just like, why would I quit now? You know? Why
would I leave to leave and...leave my buddies?

So when you say you, leave your friends, you were talking about friends
that were here?

Yes.

Was there any thought of people that weren’t here? Friends or family
outside of the situation?

Yeah. Yeah, I thought about my family a lot. Um...you know, feeling the
shame of, like, telling my dad or my mom that like hey I quit or I got
rolled or something happened. Um...yeah, that, that definitely weighed
on me a bit.

Do you have any practices, physical, mental, spiritual, that you used to
push through the challenges? So, again, like a prayer or a mantra or a
visualization exercise. Some athletes will have a warm up routine.

Yeah.

Did you have anything that was…?

Uh, nothing like that. I remember, though, for, like specifically the
OC-8 test, I would go back to my room and like write down, try to like
recollect and rethink like, OK, what did I do that day? What did I do
wrong? What do I need to do right? And just sort of like I could see
something on paper and go, OK, just try to do that next time and um
think about that like during the evolution. And like before OC-8 I was,
I was on the pool that just going through kind of like, OK, remember the
key points that you wrote down last night? Try to do those. If you do
those, you're going to be successful, so.

So that is like a reflection and visulaization as well.

Yeah, yeah.

When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went
through your mind as you made that decision? And was there a decision
that you really struggled with at BUD/S? fights, for example, running
classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate?

Yeah. Um...mmm...I think like at least in like first phase, like the
difficult decisions, I would say, are were more of like I don't, I don't
want to quit and look like inferior to my buddies. But, like, I don't
know...Yes, that's a, that’s a tough question. A difficult decision that
I just try I just always try to think of myself like, don't quit.
Um...this sucks right now, like you'll push through.

Yeah, so that's that's definitely like the decision to quit or not. I
think we’re looking for a like a difficult decision relates to a
situation.

OK.

So did you ever consider running a class out or did you ever encounter a
classmate cheating or cutting corners that you felt that you confronted,
um, like in the evals? Any sort of difficult conversations.

Yeah, I mean uh....No, I don't think so. I've never had to like...never
ran a classmate out. But I mean, as far as, like, the evals, things like
I don't think that they were too difficult to me just because, like,
they're true. I always try to just be truthful in them. But um, as far
as difficult decisions, no I can't really think of anything specifically
that, that I had to do.

Why do you think that you were successful at BUD/S?

Uh, I would say that I had a great friend group who were all very
motivated that were here for the same reasons. Um...And just trying to
impress them and, and make it through the program with them helped me
kind of find my inner strength like, oh, if my buddies can do it, I can
do it. And um...I just had sort of like this, like, if I'm going to, you
know, I put a lot of time into it. And so if I'm going to give this my
everything, like there's no way that I'm going to ring the bell or if I
get injured, I get injured. But there's no way that I'm going to leave
the program voluntarily.

You’re all in.

Yeah.

OK, so what was different about those that didn't make it? Those guys
that dropped? What did they lack?

Um...I don't know, it's tough because I don't know if they're like
lacked. I mean, I met some really good guys, ended up quitting. I don't
know if they, they lacked anything per se. I just think they maybe had
thoughts of doing something else. They maybe if they had something,
something else going on in their lives, that, they might have just
thought this wasn't for them. It's, it's, it’s weird because I like, a
lot of the. I think that there a lot better guys than me that quit.

Better in what way?

Physical, mentally stronger. I think in the, in the end, it's just kind
of like a decision like do you want to keep going or do you want to do
something else.

A decision?

I think so. Definitely

Has this experience changed you as a person?

Oh, yeah.

How?

Very humbling pipeline. Uh, it teaches you a lot about yourself in a way
that, that I don't think that I would ever figure out. Like...there's
always going to be somebody better than you. You can never, you can
never not find work. You will always have something to do and you should
always be improving. And I learned more in these six months at BUD/S
than I did in my entire sports career. It’s like...you're always going
to be humbled. There's always something to do. You know, it's just kind
of like a microcosm of life itself. It's really interesting talking to
my buddies all the time of, like, learn more in these six months I feel
like I have almost the entirety of my entire life playing sports for
sure.

Is there anything that we didn't ask or cover that you think would be
relevant to this investigation and?

Um...No, I think that comes about, about everything. Yeah can’t really
think of anything else.

NAME AND DO YOU MIND IF I RECORD?

SURE UH

I MEAN NOT YOUR NAME UH SORRY, YOUR NUMBER HAHAH

241 HAHA

MIND IF I RECORD?

OKAY GREAT. SO WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUDS CLASS AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST
BUDS EXPERIENCE?

UH, IT IS YES. I AM AN ORIGINAL 331 MEMBER. CLASSED UP I THINK AUGUST.

OKAY, AND THEN HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU.. I AM JUST GOING TO ASK RANDOM
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND AND IT MIGHT SEEM RANDOM BUT THERE IS A
METHOD TO IT. SO HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE AND WHAT IS YOUR BIRTH

YOU PRIOR TO BUDS AND WHATEVER YOU THINK IS LIFE CHANGING THAT’S WHAT I
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT? IF ANY.

UMM, I’D SAY THE FIRST ONE WAS LIKE WHEN MY DAD WENT TO JAIL IN HIGH
SCHOOL. HE WAS LIKE 20 YEARS IN WHEN HE CAME OUT OF JAIL AND WENT BACK
IN SO HE WAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN IN AND OUT OF JAIL SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. UHH

UH I DON’T KNOW. I GUESS IT DESTABILIZED UM LIKE MY UH I GUESS LIKE MY
UH EXPECTATION ON THE FUTURE. EXPECTATION OF WHAT (UNINTELLIGIBLE).
FAMILY AND ALL THAT AND IT KIND OF LIKE TOOK MEANING AWAY FROM MY LIFE.
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) I GUESS LIKE FINDING MY OWN.

OKAY.

ANOTHER LIFE CHANGING THAT I WOULD SAY IS PROBABLY LIKE PURSUIT IN
SOCCER CAREER. I REALLY WANTED TO BE A SOCCER PLAYER SINCE I WAS YOUNG.
AND UM AND WHEN I WAS LIKE 23 YEARS I WAS LIKE IT'S JUST NOT WORKING
OUT. SOCCER WAS LIKE MY IDENTITY PRETTY MUCH. SO I BASICALLY HAD MY
IDENTITY TAKEN AWAY FROM ME NOW. I HAD TO WAKE UP AND FIND MEANING AND
FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

DID YOU HAVE AN INJURY OR YOU JUST…

NO IT'S JUST TRIED OUT FOR VARIOUS TEAMS DIDN’T REALLY GET SIGNED. SO
YOU KNOW, BASICALLY JUST DIDN’T MAKE IT.

OKAY AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY HELPED YOU GET THROUGH BUD/S?
ANYTHING SPECIFIC?

UM UH I DON’T KNOW I JUST I THINK. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS
YESTERDAY LIKE I GUESS FOR JUST SOME REASON I GUESS I JUST I CAN’T LIKE
BEEN SEEN AS WEAK. SO I CAN’T QUITE LIKE NOT LIKE BE IMPRESSED
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) AT THE TOP LIKE I JUST CAN’T ALLOW MYSELF TO BE WEAK.
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) CAN’T ALLOW MYSELF TO QUIT OR SEEN AS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) IF OTHERS ARE DOING IT, THERE’S NO REASON I CAN’T DO
IT. YA KNOW (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

WHAT ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND LED YOU TO WANT TO BE A SEAL LIKE DO YOU HAVE
ANY SEALS THAT ARE FAMILY OR FRIENDS, DO YOU HAVE MILITARY?

UH NO, I JUST PLAYED A VIDEO GAME IN LIKE SEVENTH GRADE THAT TAUGHT ME
THAT (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

** LONG PAUSE WITH A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE AS CDR LEDFORD COMES IN THE
BACKGROUND SPEAKING OF SEEING PATTI AFTER YOU’RE DONE**

OKAY SO YOU PLAYED A VIDEO IN SEVENTH GRADE?

I PLAYED A VIDEO GAME AND LIKE I CAN’T EXPLAIN WHY BUT I WAS JUST
FASCINATED BY LIKE SECRET SOLDIER QUIET. UM I DON’T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME
TO GET INTO THIS BUT I KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT WHY I WOULD LIKE THAT TYPE
OF I DONT KNOW LIKE CAREER MAYBE IS BECAUSE IS LIKE THROUGH MY
PERSONALITY I LIKE BEING LIKE MORE DISCREET. I DON’T KNOW THAT’S MY ONLY
SELF ANALYSIS.

THAT HELPS.

BUT I DON’T KNOW. YEAH.

BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD. LIKE HOW, WHAT WAS YOUR PARENTS
DISCIPLINING STYLE, DID THEY SPANK YOU, DID THEY GIVE YOU TIMEOUTS, DO
PUSH UPS, WITHHOLDING TOYS?

MY DAD I THINK HE WAS IN THE MILITARY. I’M FROM UKRAINE. MY DAD’S
RUSSIAN. SO HE WAS PRETTY STRICT. YEAH, I DON'T KNOW FORCEFUL. SO YEAH,
I MEAN YOU KNOW HE WHIPPED ME A FEW TIMES. HE WAS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AND
LIKE INTIMIDATING SO. I DON’T KNOW. GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS KIND OF
SCARED OF MY DAD. HE WAS LIKE MEAN TO ME AND LIKE UH YEAH.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

MY MOM SHE WAS UH, MY MOM, SHE WAS NICE BUT SHE WAS ALSO KIND OF SCARY.
MY DAD, WHEN HE GOT LIKE AGGRESSIVE OR WHATEVER. THERE’S ONLY SO MUCH
SHE CAN DO. MY DAD, HE WAS HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD.

SURE. WAS YOUR MOM RUSSIAN? UKRANIAN, ALSO?

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THEY ALL SPOKE RUSSIAN. MY MOM IS FROM UKRAINE. MY DAD
IS FROM RUSSIA.

DID YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

JUST MOVED ONCE. MAYBE TWICE. *CLEARS THROAT* SO I WAS BORN IN UKRAINE.
I LIVED WITH MY GRANDMA. MY DAD KIND OF WASN’T AROUND. AND MY DAD LIKE
TOOK MY MOM TO (UNINTELLIGIBLE) TO KIND OF SET A FOUNDATION UP. FIND A
PLACE TO LIVE, FIND JOBS. SO I LIVED WITH MY GRANDMA UNTIL I WAS LIKE 6.
THEN THEY BROUGHT ME OVER. UM, (UINTELLIGIBLE) WHEN I WAS A KID HERE I
WAS KIND OF SHY. I WAS NEVER THAT CLOSE WITH MY DAD BECAUSE HE WASN’T
AROUND THAT MUCH. SO I WAS CLOSER TO MY GRANDMA AND MY MOM.

OKAY, AND TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS, HIGH SCHOOL, MIDDLE SCHOOL,
DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS AND WHAT KIND IF YOU DID?

I USED TO DO ALL KINDS OF SPORTS. LIKE BASKETBALL, BASEBALL, UH SOCCER
MAINLY. SOCCER AND SPORTS ALSO KIND OF KEPT ME SANE I GUESS. LIKE I WAS
ALWAYS SCARED OF MY HOUSE AND WANTED TO GET OUT. SO YOU KNOW SPORTS WERE
LIKE MY SOLACE. HELPED ME MAKE FRIENDS AND STUFF. UM SO YEAH.

AND THEN WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO GOING
TO BUD/S?

SO I WAS DATING A GIRL AND WE LIVED TOGETHER. WHILE, FINISHING UP
COLLEGE JUST PLAYING SOCCER.

SO YOU WERE PLAYING SOCCER FOR A COLLEGE?

YEAH, I WAS PLAYING SOCCER AND WHEN I GRADUATED I WAS LIKE TRYING OUT
FOR PROFESSIONAL TEAMS. AND WITH THE GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME.

WHAT COLLEGE WAS THAT?

IT’S CALLED HOLY FAMILY UNIVERSITY. ITS A SMALL CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY.
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THROUGH WITH SOME TEAMS AT THE
TIME. AND YEAH UH ALSO LOOKING FOR WORK. PAY BILLS. I HAD A LOT OF
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS WITH HER. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) STRESS UNTIL WE BROKE
UP. IT WAS TOTALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND WHEN WE
FINALLY BROKE UP IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A WEIGHT HAD BEEN LIFTED. I ALSO
HAD KIND OF JUST GAVE UP PURSUING SOCCER. HAD TO WORK. BUT NOT TO GET
TOO DEEP INTO THE WEEDS, BUT, I GUESS LIKE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE HERE, IS
SOMETHING ABOUT ME.(UNINTELLIGIBLE) I ALWAYS KNEW I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
MEANINGFUL, SOMETHING GOOD. I COULDN’T JUST BE SOMETHING
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)... I DON’T KNOW.

RIGHT, YOU WANTED A..

I DIDN’T WANT TO BE JUST AVERAGE. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING. EITHER A
PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYER OR LIKE I SAID SEALS (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

WAS HOLY FAMILY UNIVERSITY DIVISION 1? DIVISION 2?

ITS DIVISION 2.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? LIKE DO YOU HAVE TATTOOS OR… NO?
OKAY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF BUD/S? IF YOU CAN
THINK OF ONE DAY THAT WAS CHALLENGING WHAT WAS IT AND WHAT MOTIVATED YOU
TO PUSH THROUGH?

SO I WOULD SAY IT WAS PROBABLY LIKE WEDNESDAY OF HELL WEEK. SO LIKE UM
WEDNESDAY MY BODY STARTED BREAKING DOWN. SO LIKE I WAS NOT PERFORMING
WELL AND THE INSTRUCTORS KIND OF HONED IN ON ME AND SOME OF MY OWN
CLASSMATES. THEY CAN REALLY SOCIALLY ISOLATE YOU LIKE SOCIAL ISOLATION
BASICALLY FELT LIKE NO ONE WANTED ME THERE. UH, THAT WAS PROBABLY THE
HARDEST.

SO WHAT MADE YOU PUSH THROUGH? AND DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED
BY THE GROUP OR WERE THEY?

NO, I DIDN’T FEEL LIKE I WAS SUPPORTED. I FELT LIKE NO ONE WANTED ME
THERE. BUT AND GOING BACK TO LIKE, I JUST CAN’T BE SEEN AS WEAK SO I
JUST COULDN’T QUIT. THEY CAN DROP ME, GET RID OF ME, BUT I CAN’T JUST
LIKE GIVE UP. WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS TO ME BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE
ON MY END.

DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL PRACTICES THAT HELP YOU GET THROUGH LIKE
PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL THAT HELP YOU GET TO THE NEXT THING?

UM I MEAN. PRACTICES? LIKE WHAT KIND OF PRACTICES?

LIKE MEDITATION, OR PRAYER OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. WHATEVER HELPS YOU GET
GROUNDED. AND IF YOU DON’T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S FINE TOO.

I GUESS JUST THINK ABOUT MY PAST AND KNOW WHAT’S IMPORTANT. AND WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND ITS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. REMEMBER THAT. I MEAN
ITS A PHILOSOPHY I GUESS.

OKAY, AND DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AT BUD/S, IF YOU HAD
SOMETHING WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION AND WHAT
DID YOU STRUGGLE WITH? LIKE CLASSMATES CHEATING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
AND IF YOU DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S FINE TOO.

I DON’T KNOW. I GUESS THE ONE THING THAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS WHEN I DID
NOT DO SOMETHING AN INSTRUCTOR ASKED ME TO DO AND I WAS TEMPTED TO LIKE
JUST LIE ABOUT IT. IT WAS BASICALLY LIKE “YOU OWE ME 100 8-COUNTS BY
TOMORROW.” I DIDN’T FINISH THEM. I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN LIKE “YEAH I
DID ‘EM” THE NEXT DAY. IT WAS JUST LIKE I CAN’T LIE. AND I ENDED UP
GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR (UNINTELLIGIBLE) THE NEXT DAY. THAT’S THE ONLY
THING I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW.

OKAY. NO, THAT’S GOOD. SO THERE’S SO MANY PEOPLE. YOU STARTED WITH THIS
CLASS, RIGHT? SO THERE’S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT GET ROLLED, DROPPED. IF YOU
COULD THINK OF ONE THING, WHAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL?

UM, I MEAN “1.” LIKE I SAID EARLIER, LIKE I JUST

STUBBORN?

YEAH LIKE I CAN’T BE SEEN AS WEAK. LIKE BEING LABELED AS WEAK IS LIKE I
DON’T KNOW. TO ME THAT’S LIKE SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)
PEOPLE SEEING ME AS WEAK OR PERCEIVING MYSELF AS WEAK. AND 2.
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) WHETHER IT IS SHOOTING OR DIVING OR WHATEVER, I GUESS I
AM DECENTLY COMPETENT, I GUESS I NEVER REALLY HAD TROUBLE WITH LIKE THAT
PART.

SO YOU’RE COMPETENT, BUT DID YOU HAVE COMPETENCY IN THOSE THINGS COMING
IN OR DID YOU LEARN QUICKLY OR?

YEAH, I GUESS I WAS ALWAYS GOOD AT SPORTS SO I JUST HAD A NATURAL
INCLINATION TOWARDS ATHLETIC THINGS SO MAYBE IT JUST TRANSFERS OVER TO
HERE.

WHAT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU SAW QUIT? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT
THOSE PEOPLE THAN YOU?

UHH, I DON’T KNOW I GUESS I AM (UNINTELLIGIBLE) VERY INTROSPECTIVE FOR
THE FIRST HALF OF IT. CONTEMPLATE THE MEANING A LOT. I GUESS I CAN GET
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT’S IMPORTANT IN LIFE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK, DID THIS BUDS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

I’VE REACHED LIKE MY LOWEST LOWS HERE. I BREAKTHROUGH AND SEE THAT
WHEN YOU’RE AT THE

LOWEST LOWS, THAT THERE’S STILL HOPE AND EVERYTHING MUST PASS
BASICALLY. EVERYTHING ALWAYS

PASSES.

WOW, THAT’S A GREAT LESSON.

IT ALWAYS PASSES.

Yeah, is there anything else in this interview that I should have
asked you that you think that it would be good for the Navy to know if
they interview people that come in here? Anything I missed? Oh you
should ask this and that will really help?

I GUESS TO CONTEMPLATE THE MEANING OF LIFE. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) SOMETHING
ALONG THOSE LINES.

BECAUSE I MEAN I HAD MY MEANING, MY DIRECTION TAKEN AWAY FROM ME
DURING TEENAGE YEARS.

Okay, awesome. I think that's very helpful.
: QUINN BARBER

DATE: 17AUG20

PARTICIPANT : 247

LENGTH OF THE INTERVIEW: 19

Record this.

No, not at all.

And then what’s your number?

247.

Okay, so when did you start BUD/S and is this your first
BUD/S experience?

This is my first BUD/S experience. Uh I started uhm Bo was
August 6^(th) or August 8^(th) of 2019 uhm.

Okay.

Actual BUD/S itself was the beginning September of 2019 as
well.

Okay, so I’m going to ask you some background questions.

Okay.

How many siblings do you have? Like older brother, older
sister?

I’m an only child.

Okay, that’s easy.

Yep.

Were your parents married, separated, divorced?

Divorced when I was 4.

Are you close with them?

Absolutely. But I wouldn’t say as much so as like I guess
some other people. I am close with them but I, I feel like there’s
people that are a lot closer with their parents like are best friends
with their parents and call ‘em every day. I mean, I probably call my
parents like maybe I don’t know twice a month.

Okay.

Something like that. Nothing, nothing crazy they’re there
and they support me but.

Ok, so what would you say any, did you have any life
changing events before you came to BUD/S? And whatever you think is life
changing is life changing cause there’s not, some people have three
things and some people have none.

Uhm, I didn’t have a whole lot so I would say in highschool
I wouldn’t say I guess, ya know, life changing is big maybe it's a
little bit smaller than that but I, uhm, my mom got married to uhm a guy
that lived in Florida and uhm so I kind had lived in uhm Wheaton
Illinois its in the Chicago land area, uhm, for my uh entire life up
until I was uhm 14 and uhm ended up moving with my mom and uh kinda
having to uhm not see my dad anymore kinda had to pick sides between my
parents uhm which kinda sucked and uhm there was a whole uh process in
Illinois to get that approved with divorced parents and stuff so I had
to uhm go through that I actually had my own lawyer and everything.

Wow.

And uhm, had to like go in and talk to the judge and he had
to grant uhm, ya know my mom the ability to take me down to Florida.
Ended up going to school down there for a year and it was like freshman
year of highschool so uhm it was kind of a different adjustment I, I
would say Florida the culture is a little bit different and just the
kids are different and uhm, eh I went from being like pretty suburban
uhm to being really rural uhm so it's just, it was just different uhm
but I think it I think I gained a lot from it just being more of a
people person and more of ya know could get along with anyone and I
think that’s super important just in anything you do.

So that specifically from your experience helped you in
BUD/S being able to be a people person.

Uhm yeah, yeah because that was the first time I mean uhm
Wheaton, Illinois there are like, it's like the most churches per square
mile in the US. Super conservative town, I don’t know if you’ve heard of
like Billy Graham Wheaton ...

Yep, yeah.

College uhm so super uhm Christian town and noth, nothing’s
wrong with that but uhm you kinda I think people in the town kinda grow
up in their little bubble and there’s a lot of kids that they end up
going to Wheaton College to find their spouse and then they end up
getting married at 22 and uhm that wasn’t anything that ever really
appealed to me uhm but yeah so I, I think getting away from that bubble
and kinda getting out of my comfort zone that was big and then uhm
college did that a lot for me too uhm before coming here you're able to
work with other people from kinda different backgrounds and stuff and I
think that’s huge, that’s huge.

So, what about your personality has contributed to your
progression in BUD/S?

Uhm, so I think I’m uh pretty hard on myself and pretty
self-aware and I think that’s uhm big so I think uh kinda a lot of guys
uh don’t they aren’t necessarily like quick learners when it comes to
like hey I did this wrong I cant screw that up again kinda thing like
everybody here everyone of these guys screwed up at some point uhm and I
think it's kinda how you bounce back from that so uh whether it's you
not doing well in an evolution or you failing something or uhm even you
just not getting along with uhm your peers here or making the wrong call
when it came to uhm how we were going to do this or that and just kinda
learning and changing from that I think is huge.

Okay.

Uhm, I think that’s something and uh ya know I’ve, I’ve
always kinda realized that this and just anything you’re going to do in
life isn’t going to happen overnight uhm and I think that’s really hard
for especially the younger guys you see coming in here through the
pipeline like 18, 19, right out of highschool, uhm it's hard for those
guys to uhm realize that, ya know, we’re not going to wake up tomorrow
morning and, and have tridents on our chests so, uhm yeah so I guess
those two things.

That’s very mature, yeah.

Yeah.

Uhm tell me why did you even want to become a SEAL, like
did you have someone in the family that was military?

So.

Did you read a book, see a movie, play a video game?

Uhm, yeah so, I watched a movie Tears of the Sun, it’s a
terrible movie. Uhm and uh, I think I was like 8. And I asked my, I was
watching with my Dad, I remember. Uhm in our family living room and I
asked him what are Navy SEALs and he, he said that they were like the
toughest of the tough and tha... I remember him using the phrase that
they spit bullets. And I uh, I said, I was 8 years old and I said
spittin bullets sounds pretty, pretty frickin’ cool. Uhm, I wanna do
that. And uhm, it was just something that culminated and I, I think you
get asked that question a thousand times and you can give a thousand
different answers, but uhm, at the end of the day at least for me (sigh)
like I think there, like the reason, there’s tons of different reasons
that I’m here and where I at, ya know, I wanted to be here but I just
always felt right man, I was like this is where I’m meant to be this is
what I’m meant to do, uhm, I’m a huge believer in God. Uh, I don’t know,
I think, I think you kinda have to believe in something uhm, to get
through this pipeline. And, and I kinda prayed about it a bunch and uhm
just always felt like this is kinda what I was gonna pursue and this is
what I was gonna do and ya know this is ultimately what I was gonna,
going to do. (Unintelligible, what I was meant to do maybe?)

Okay, tell me a little about your childhood. Like how did
your parents discipline you? Did you, did you get spanked? Did you get a
timeout? Did you have to do physical things?

Uhm, so I got spanked, I think my Dad pulled the belt out a
couple times. Uhm, I don’t know, nothing out of the ordinary.

Yeah.

Uhm, yeah, I was uh I was, for the most part like I said I
was born in that Wheaton bubble. So I think I was uh, pretty, pretty
sheltered as a kid, uhm so I, I didn’t get into a ton of trouble or
anything uhm. Ya know I didn’t, I think there’s some, some kids here,
that uhm, some of the guys that, ya know, that grew up in really rough
homes. I, for the most part I was super fortunate. Uhm, and thank God
for that. Uhm.

Tell me about...

So.

your highschool years. Did you, were you on a team sport?
Did you have a real close knit community in something that you did? And
I know you moved but…

So...

even middle school.

Yeah, so, I did uh I always did boy scouts. Uh which was,
that was huge for me growing up. You’re just kinda, get, ya know keeps
you busy. And, and I think that’s one of the reasons that I stayed out
of a lot of trouble was that I was busy doing stuff all the time. I did
cross country, I did hockey, I did indoor track, and I did outdoor
track. Uhm.

Wow.

So I was, I was runnin’ or skatin’ most of the time. Uhm I
mean there was, there was nights in highschool uhm where like Monday
night I would have cross country practice and then I’d go home and get
my uniform because we had boy scouts that night. And then Tuesday I
would have cross country practice and then I would go home for 2 hours,
do homework, eat dinner, and then I had hockey practice for 2 hours.
And, and then the same thing was Wednesday night. And like Thursday and
Friday I would get a break. But I think towards my senior year that
changed because that’s when I got a job, so I was like workin’ those two
nights, so it was just like I was always super busy like I didn’t have
time to turn to drugs or whatever kids are doin’ nowadays to get in
trouble.

Yeah.

So.

What about the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S?
So, you said you didn’t come straight out of highschool or straight out
of college, what’d you?

I came straight out of college.

Straight out of college?

Yes, yeah, I went…

So you went from highschool to college to?

Uhm.

enlist?

Yes, yes, uh no, well I’m an officer, so

Okay.

I, I was in the uhm, uh the ROTC program at Ole Miss.

Okay.

So, yeah, I uh went there uhm tried to get into the Naval
Academy, didn’t get in, uhm hindsight glad I didn’t because I enjoyed my
college years. Uhm I went to visit Ole Miss and I think I was gonna
visit UMaine and couple other colleges. Uh went to Ole Miss and was like
game day and uh all the girls were really hot so that was ultimately...

(Laughter).

like why I chose to go there. Kind of a dumb reason, but
uhm, my mom was askin’ me. And we got a tour and they were like most
Miss America’s of any university in like the U.S. And I was like…

I’m in. (Laughter).

Sold! I’m here. That’s an easy decision.

That’s alright, I hear a lot of people pick for, because
the food that they have.

Yeah.

Or the coffee.

Yeah, exactly.

They have starbucks.

Yeah, (unintelligible).

I’ve heard of worse things so. Okay, so would you consider
yourself impulsive? I see you have a tattoo. Is that an impulse or did
you think about it or?

Uhm, no. Uh it’s Saint Michael, uhm.

Okay.

We’re really Catholic, so.

Okay.

Uhm, no that was not, not impulsive. Something I’ve thought
about. I don’t know, I, I feel like I can’t get any more because I’m an
officer and it’s like looked down on, I’m not sure whether I’m gonna uhm
gonna listen to that or follow those kinda unsaid, unsaid rules, but uh
yeah, no I wouldn't, I wouldn’t consider myself impulsive.

Okay. So what was the most, think of the most challenging
day you’ve had here at BUD/S and what motivated you to push through?

So it was Monday of the 3rd week, of 1st phase so the 3rd
week...

Is that Hell Week?

Uh no, no.

Oh.

No, that’s the 4th week. So the 3rd week uhm, it’s kinda
known as, and I think things are changing now, but it, it has been known
as like a taper week. So they do like, you have like 2 or 3 days of like
normal BUD/S days and then they kind of taper in before you start Hell
Week obviously. And uhm, that Monday we had a log PT and we just did
count off lunges for days. It was just like and uhm, I was like called
out early on, singled out by the instructors for uhm kinda not doin’
well on the lunges and the ends of the log are known as the harder parts
and I was, the instructor was like Brynce, you’re gonna stay at the end
of the log the entire time. And I said okay, roger that, and uhm and so
I was, I was at the end for the rest of the log pt. And they’re, they do
them in 3 parts. They’re like half hour incre, ya know, iterations I
guess is the right. So, this is like 15 minutes into the first
iteration, so I know I’ve got like another hour comin’ at me I’m, I’ma
be on the end of that log. Uhm, and I, that was the hardest I’ve ever
been worked my entire life like...

Mhm.

physically. And I was just.

So, what helped you get through that?

Uhm.

Especially knowing that it wasn’t just like half an hour it
was gonna be like the whole…

So, uhm, in the moment I don’t think I really thought about
it, I wasn’t like, I didn’t I don’t know, it’s just. I guess guys have
that like aha moment where they like think about quitting, I didn’t,
like, I was like I’m gonna be here. Like, it doesn’t, they’re gonna drag
me away. Like I, I don’t, I don’t know, maybe, probably sounds like
super uh I don’t know like...

No, no.

tough of me. But yeah I just, I never thought about that.
Uhm.

So what practices helped you get through mental, spiritual,
you said you’re Catholic.

Yeah, so, uhm.

Did you say a lot of prayers?

That night I prayered, I prayed a bunch and then I talked
to my buddy who’s a couple of classes in front of me. We actually went
to college together uhm and we were really good friends, trained all
throughout college. He’s in SQT now, uhm, and I called him and he kinda
gave me reassurance, uhm. He bas, there was uh, another kid in his class
that kinda same sort of thing had happened and he made it through uhm.
And he was like I said in the same situation and he was like dude I know
you I know you would, uhm, I know you’re not gonna, ya know, you’re
aren’t going anywhere kinda thing just like keep your head down and keep
pushin’ and… so that kinda is what I did and ya know, uh, next day’s a
new day kinda woke up with a positive attitude and uhm things got a
little bit better. Ya know, you’re, you’re kinda so far down at some
point you’re like oh it’s gotta get better at some point, so

(Laughter)

And then it did, uhm, and like I said uhm, thank God for
him and ya know, thank God for these guys supporting me too. Even these
dudes that were on my log they knew uh that I was like strugglin’ and,
and because of that they, ya know, picked up the slack. So, and it’s ya
know everybody’s gotta bad day, ya know? Even the, even the strongest
dude in here had a bad day.

Absolutely.

So.

What about you had to make, I’m gonna ask you more about
mental things now, if ya had to make a tough decision as an officer, uh,
anything any decision that you struggled with. Like turning in a
classmate or running someone out because they really shouldn’t be here.
What did you think about? What, thr, went through your mind when you
made that decision and could you give me an example?

Uhm.

And I’ve probably heard of about everything that you’re
thinking about right now.

Yes.

Probably already heard of them.

You probably, uhm, so we ran three kids out. One, uh one of
the land portages we had. We actually ended up runnin’ the boat with
four guys, uhm which kinda sucked, ya know, ya jus, ya know, ya jus,
you’re like oh I have seven well now I have four uhm.

But, so, what made ya think of, it was okay ...

Uhm, so.

or that you needed to that person out?

So, yeah, so, so some guys are a little different, uhm some
officers, they’re all a little different, there’s one guy, like there’s
a couple guys in here and it’s like and they knew immediately if that
guy wasn’t performing they’re gone. For every dude that I ran out or uhm
kinda our boat crew had chose to run out it was normally a guy that was
like a, a repeated poor performer, uhm, and was, at, at some point you
have to have the realization that like this dude’s gonna get someone
hurt if, if he’s here.

Right.

Ya know? Uhm and it’s uhm it’s a hard decision, but I think
at the end of the day like I don’t have any regrets about runnin’ those
guys out and I think, hopefully they’re better for it now and hopefully
they realize kinda the uhm the decision because I know if I wasn’t
performing and it was consistently a problem like I wouldn’t wanna get
someone hurt like I wouldn’t wanna be...

Sure.

That’s just selfish, and that’s...

Right.

Everybody and anybody in this room uhm ya know knows that’s
not okay, so.

So why do you think you were successful in completing
BUD/S? You’re on that path to be successful.

Uhm. I think that the guys around you make you successful.
Uh, I think that speaks ta kinda who you’ve put yourself around
(unintelligible).

Okay, so let me ask you opposite. What made, did you notice
things that were different about the kids who quit, who left? What made
them different than you and the people who are still here?

Uhm, so I noticed a couple things. So one was, uhm, you
would see guys kinda get uhm like it wouldn’t, they would get stuck in
like they’re uhm, rock climbers call it your three foot zone or
whatever. They’re like only worry about you’re three foot zone, only
worry about like what’s right in front of you, what can affect you in
like that second. And I think guys, you’d see them with that like
thousand foot stare, and they’d just like they would just be completely
out of it, they wouldn’t, they wouldn’t be thinking straight, they’re
like thinking like oh, like it’s almost like in a Hell Week, like you’re
thinking about that minute you’re in. Like if I’m in the push up
position I’m in the push up position. If I’m going to hit the surf I’m
going to hit the surf. Where these kids would be like holy shit it’s
Monday like we’ve got like three, four more days of this. Like in my
mind I was just like ya know I just have to get to the meal or I just
have to get through this exercise ya know? It was never, so guys
thinkin’ too far ahead and kinda havin’ that thousand foot stare and
then uhm you would uh. You would definitely see uhm a guy like start to
get, start to get super quiet and stuff and it was when he was uhm kinda
comin’ to that realization that this wasn’t for him, uhm whether it be
because he wasn’t performing or he wasn’t fittin’ in for, with the guys
or guys were kinda pushin’ him out uhm, especially in our class, we’re
kinda, we’re known as the class that kinda like ate our own young. Like
dudes would be like if you’re not supposed to be...

You had trouble with your leadership right?

Yeah, our leadership quit right off the bat like …

I heard that.

Yeah, and in Hell Week so, but it was like dudes were
really hard on each other. Uhm and I don’t know if that’s the way it’s
supposed to be or, or anything. But ya know ultimately like that weeded
out a lot of individuals, so.

And ultimately how do you think this whole experience at
mud, at BUD/S has changed you as a person?

Uhm, I think I have a better idea of like what’s, what’s
possible and what uhm myself and these group of guys are kinda capable
of and I think that’s really cool uhm. And I think I’m uh I don’t know
just a better person from it. I’ve, I’ve grown a ton uhm I am a lot more
grateful for little things (laughter).

Hot water.

Yeah, yeah little things like that. Uhm, good food. Uhm,
not eatin’ the galley which is (chuckle). Yeah good food, grateful just
for little things man, you’ll be like sittin’ at home like playin’ video
games and you’re warm and you’re not runnin’ and you’re ju, I don’t
know, you’re just ...

Mhm.

like I’m so much more content with that than I used to be.
Uhm which is kinda, I think is, is huge. I think that’s awesome, even as
like from a faith based stand point as well so.

Anything that I should’ve asked you? So the Navy’s askin’
us to do this to try to help them be able to pick better candidates to
come through BUD/S.

(Unintelligible).

Is there anything I should’ve asked you that would maybe
help illustrate that? That I didn’t ask you?

Uhm, I don’t know, that’s kind of a tough ans, or question
to answer on the spot. I would kinda ask uhm about uhm just make sure
every dude you find is like the, the most selfless dude in the world.
Because those are the, those are the guys that are the difference
makers. Those are the guys that uhm I, ya know, myself likes to be
around and that’s who, who I strive to be to and I think that’s so
important man.

Okay.

Uh, the teams that (unintelligible). Just, uhm, some of
these guys come out here and uhm ya know they’re the first to be inside
and showerin’ at the end of the day and they’re the, ya know the last
person to help out to kinda look for work and stuff and uhm that’s
bullshit man.

You can tell?

Yeah.

Okay, that was very help...


 (SIO): IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S
  EXPERIENCE AND WHEN DID YOU START?

THIS IS MY FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE AND I STARTED WITH THIS CLASS 339 AND
UHH…

 CONGRATS, THAT’S NOT… YOU’RE ONE OF THE FEW THAT STARTED WITH
  THIS CLASS… WOW… I’M GOING TO ASK YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION
  NOW.

 HOW MANY SIBLINGS DID YOU HAVE? WERE THEY OLDER, YOUNGER,
  GIRLS, BOYS?

UMM I AM THE NUMBER 3 OUT OF 4. I HAVE TWO OLDER SISTERS AND A YOUNGER
BROTHER.

 AND THEN ARE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

THEY’RE MARRIED.

 AND WHAT WAS… WHAT’S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM?

UHH I’M PRETTY CLOSE WITH THEM… I CALL THEM, MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK I’D
SAY, ON AVERAGE. A LITTLE MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK. BOTH OF THEM.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE THAT BEFORE YOU CAME
  TO BUD/S? AND WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU IS WHAT I MEAN… SOME PEOPLE
  SAY “NO I DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING”, SOME PEOPLE GIVE ME 5 THINGS.

UHH I WOULDN’T SAY THERE’S ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR. NOTHING THAT REALLY
CHANGED OR ROCKED MY WORLD OR ANYTHING.

 DO YOU THINK… HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO
  YOUR PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UM I THINK, I’D SAY I’M MORE LAID BACK AND I DON’T REALLY STRESS ABOUT
THINGS TOO MUCH. THAT’S WHAT OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT TO ME. I REALLY
DON’T GET STRESSED ABOUT THINGS, AND UH, JUST TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME.

 AND TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LEAD YOU TO SEALS. DO
  YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WAS A SEAL? IS YOUR FAMILY MILITARY? DID YOU
  WATCH A MOVIE?

UM SO MY… (PAUSE) LETS SEE… I DON’T KNOW, I DIDN’T KNOW ANYBODY IN THIS
COMMUNITY COMING IN AT ALL. BOTH MY PARENTS ARE MILITARY. THEY’RE BOTH
NAVY. MY MOM WAS A NURSE AND MY DAD WAS A PILOT. UM. AND… AND THEN JUST
GETTING EXPOSED TO THIS I DON’T KNOW. IT WAS KIND OF POPULAR ESPECIALLY
IN JUST MOVIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. IT WASN’T LIKE ONE PARTICULAR MOVIE
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I JUST SLOWLY BECAME EXPOSED TO IT. IT WAS
ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD. THOUGHT ABOUT IT THROUGH COLLEGE. AND
THEN UH YEAH… AND WORKED SOME JOBS… AND I WAS LIKE DEFINITELY DON’T WANT
TO WORK THOSE JOBS.

 I’M GONNA ASK YOU ABOUT THAT STUFF. BUT LET ME ASK YOU A LITTLE
  ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD FIRST. WHEN YOUR PARENTS DISCIPLINED YOU DID
  THEY GIVE YOU A TIMEOUT, SPANK YOU, DID THEY MAKE YOU DO PUSHUPS?
  DID THEY TAKE THINGS AWAY? WHAT WAS THEIR MAIN…

UHHH A GOOD MIX OF THAT. SO I DID GET THE BELT GROWING UP. UMM… THEY… I
WOULD HAVE TO… THIS ONE I LEARNED IN THE NAVY. UH MY DAD PROBABLY GOT IT
FROM THE NAVY. HE WOULD HAVE ME WRITE PAPERS, SENTENCES OVER AND OVER
AGAIN. UMM YEAH THEY WOULD LIKE GROUND ME, NOSE IN THE CORNER, THEY
TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES FOR DISCIPLINING.

 YEAH. PARENTS DO. UM DID YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT WHEN YOU WERE IN
  YOUR TEENAGE YEARS OR CHILDHOOD?

NOT SO MUCH TEENAGE BUT CHILDHOOD. SO I LIVED IN… I WAS BORN IN
MARYLAND, DON’T REMEMBER THAT AT ALL. THEN LIVED IN SPAIN FOR 3 YEARS.
THEN WENT TO NEWPORT FOR A YEAR. PENSACOLA FOR 4 YEARS, THEN FINALLY
MOVED TO OHIO. AND THAT WAS WHEN I WAS 11. AND I WAS THERE SINCE.

 TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A TEAM
  SPORT? DID YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY? ANY COMMUNITY THAT MADE YOU CLOSE
  LIKE BOY SCOUTS, OR CHURCH, OR…?

UM I PLAYED A LOT OF SOCCER, I PLAYED BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL TOO BUT
SOCCER WAS THE MAIN SPORT I PLAYED. UH THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL THAT’S
WHAT I DID. I PLAYED YEAR ROUND AS I GOT MORE INTO THAT. AND YEAH THAT’S
LIKE MORE THE…

 DID YOU PLAY ON A COMPETITIVE LEAGUE, OR JUST YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
  OR BOTH?

HIGH SCHOOL AND CLUB. AND THE HIGH SCHOOL TEAM WE WERE PRETTY CLOSE. I
GUESS THAT’S PART OF, UHH, I GUESS WHY I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE
THIS TOO. KINDA LIKE THE CAMARADERIE OF IT.

SIQ: I’M AMAZED AT HOW MANY SOCCER PLAYERS WE HAVE. I MEAN I’VE
  INTERVIEWED 12 PEOPLE AND PROBABLY 5 OF HAVE BEEN SOCCER PLAYERS. I
  DON’T KNOW IF THERE’S A CORRELATION, WE’LL FIND OUT. UM SO WHAT DID
  YOU DO IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S? YOU WENT TO
  HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN YOU WENT…

SO I’M 24 NOW. I WENT TO COLLEGE IT WAS A 5-YEAR PROGRAM UHHH.

 WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT?

UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI AND UHH GOT A… THEIR ENGINEERING DEGREE PROGRAM
IS 5 YEARS. SO DID THAT. AND THEN I KNEW I WAS GONNA COME HERE AT THAT
POINT. HAD SOME EXTRA MONEY BECAUSE I WORKED CO-OPS. UM AND DECIDED WITH
THAT I WAS JUST GONNA GO BACKPACKING IN EUROPE FOR A BIT SO I DID THAT
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

 HOW DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE GONNA COME HERE? DID YOU HAVE A
  CONTRACT? AN ENLISTMENT CONTRACT?

UMM WELL I JUST KNEW I WAS, THIS WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO AS A JOB.
THAT I WAS GOING TO JOIN THE NAVY. AND I INITIALLY WAS GOING TO TRY TO
GO OFFICER ROUTE, RESEARCHED IT, EVERYTHING MORE, TALKED TO RECRUITERS,
AND THEN DECIDED TO GO ENLISTED AND I WAS LIKE WELL ENLISTED I CAN DO AT
ANY TIME. SO THAT’S WHY, AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BACKPACKING TOO SO I
DECIDED TO DO THAT.

 COOL. WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? LIKE DO YOU HAVE
  ANY TATTOOS OR DO YOU LIKE TO BINGE DRINK?

NO, I DON’T HAVE ANY TATTOOS. OR I’M NOT A BIG DRINKER (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

 THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY THAT YOU HAD HERE. WHAT WAS IT,
  AND WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH THAT?

UMMMM I’M KIND OF SPLIT BETWEEN TWO.

OKAY GIVE ME BOTH.

ONE OF THEM I REMEMBER. I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST LOGS OF FIRST PHASE.
AND OUR BOAT CREW STRUGGLED PRETTY BAD AND I THOUGHT THAT I WAS… I
DIDN’T THINK THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF US BEING PRETTY WEAK THAT DAY BUT I
DEFINITELY STRUGGLED PRETTY HARD AND I WAS NOT HELPING BY ANY MEANS AND
THAT WAS… UHHH… I DON’T KNOW. I TALKED TO THE GUYS ABOUT IT AND THEY
SAID THEY THOUGHT I DID FINE AND THEN I JUST KEPT GOING.

AND THEN WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND?

SECOND WAS UH… IN HELL WEEK I REMEMBER WAKING UP FROM THE NAPS ON
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND HITTING THE SURF THERE. THAT WAS EXTREMELY PAINFUL.
THE LAST PLACE I WANTED TO BE. AND THAT WAS LIKE... I REMEMBER MY HEAD
WAS SO MESSED UP THAT I WAS LIKE FALLING… I FELL LIKE 5 TIMES, MY SENSE
OF BALANCE WAS COMPLETELY GONE. I COULDN’T STAND UP. MY LEGS WERE ALL
SWOLLEN AND I WAS LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY BODY SINCE THAT NAP. BUT
YEAH YOU JUST THINK OF THAT ITS EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET BETTER AND UM
THAT JUST WHAT WE’RE GOING THROUGH IS TEMPORARY.

DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE TEAM?

YEAH, YEAH. PEOPLE… I WAS PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE MORE MESSED UP GUYS BY
THE END. AND I HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE LIKE… LIKE I COULDN’T REALLY EVEN
STAND UP ON MY OWN SO MY SO MUCH WHEN WE WOULD HIT THE SURF AND STUFF
LIKE THAT PEOPLE WOULD COME IN AND WERE PICKING ME UP. UH, YEAH.

DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES, LIKE SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, MEDITATING,
  PRAYING, THAT HELPED YOU PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

SURPRISINGLY… I GO TO CHURCH… BUT SURPRISINGLY I WOULDN’T REALLY SAY
THAT WAS LIKE IN MY THOUGHTS WHILE I WAS GOING THROUGH. LIKE IN THE
MOMENT, THAT WAS NEVER REALLY A DRIVING FACTOR. EVEN THOUGH I AM
SOMEWHAT RELIGIOUS I… NAH DURING THE MOMENT IT WASN’T REALLY PLAYING A
BIG ROLE.

 IS THERE A DECISION THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH AT BUD/S?
  LIKE, TURNING IN A CLASSMATE, FOR CHEATING OR NOT DOING WHAT THEY
  SAID THEY WERE GONNA DO? WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE
  THAT DECISION?

HMM… I DON’T KNOW, NOTHING REALLY COMES TO MIND.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN BUD/S?

HMMM… UHH.. JUST TAKING THINGS AS THEY COME. I DON’T KNOW. I DON’T
REALLY GET SHOCKED BY ANY OF THE STUFF THEY THROW AT US.

 WELL LET ME ASK YOU IN A DIFFERENT WAY. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
  DIFFERENT ABOUT THE SOLDIERS… OR SAILORS… WHO DIDN’T MAKE IT? CAN
  YOU DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES? LIKE IF YOU KNEW SOMEBODY WASN’T GOING
  TO MAKE IT, LIKE WHAT MADE THEM STAND APART.

OH YEAH. UMM… FOR PEOPLE THAT I KNEW THAT WOULD THINK THEY’RE NOT GONNA
MAKE IT A LOT OF THE TIMES IT WAS LITTLE EVENTS. LIKE YOU WOULD SEE THEM
REALLY STRUGGLE WITH SOMETHING OR YOU WOULD SEE IT IN THEIR EYES. A LOT
OF THE TIMES.

 SO YOU’RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY YOU COULD SEE THAT. WHAT
  COULD YOU SEE IN THEIR EYES?

JUST KINDA LIKE… JUST LIKE BLANK STARES… JUST KINDA THOUSAND YARD STARE
SOMETIMES, OR AVOIDING EYE CONTACT. UM.

 AVOIDING EYE CONTACT?

YEAH. JUST KINDA LOOKING AT THE GROUND. YOU COULD JUST TELL THEY’RE IN
SOME DEEP THOUGHT. I MEAN THE PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY LIKE, “OH I’M
NEVER GONNA QUIT” FROM DAY ONE, THEY WERE LIKE TRYING TO PUT UP THIS
FRONT TO EVERYBODY. LIKE THEY’RE CRUISING THROUGH. LIKE NOTHING’S
AFFECTING THEM. I THINK A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE WENT AWAY. I MEAN I’M SURE
YOU GUYS ALL KNOW WHO STROKE IS OVER THERE. HE POINTS THAT OUT TOO. HE
WAS ONE OF THE GUYS STRAIGHT UP SAYING TO EVERYBODY, “I DON’T WANT TO BE
DOING THIS RIGHT NOW, BUT I’M JUST GONNA DO IT ANYWAY.” THE GUYS THAT
QUIT WOULDN’T SAY STUFF LIKE THAT. LIKE “I REALLY DON’T WANT TO BE
HERE”.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE HAS CHANGED
  YOU AS A PERSON?

UM IT’S MADE ME SUPER CONFIDENT FOR SURE. I THINK TAKING THOSE SURVEYS,
I WAS DEFINITELY MORE CONFIDENT IN MY ANSWERS.

 SO YOU’VE NOTICED A CHANGE AS YOU GO ON?

YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO. THAT FOR THIS THIS WAS ONE HUGE UNKNOWN TO ME. I
REALLY DIDN’T KNOW, COMING IN, IF I’D BE ABLE TO DO IT OR NOT. UH AND
THEN YEAH. JUST HOW FAST YOU LEARN THINGS HERE. JUST WHATEVER THEY THROW
AT YOU YOU’LL BE ABLE TO LEARN.

 SO THE NAVY IS ASKING US TO DO THIS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
  MAKES PEOPLE SUCCESSFUL BEFORE THEY START BUD/S. IS THERE ANYTHING
  THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU? THAT HELPED OR HURT YOU IN BUD/S, THAT
  I DIDN’T ASK YOU ABOUT?

UM I GUESS THE APPROACH I KIND OF TOOK COMING HERE, I REMEMBER JUST
PEOPLE COMING IN… I THINK PEOPLE GET WAY TOO INTO THE WEEDS OF LIKE WHAT
THEY SHOULD NECESSARILY PREPARE FOR. LIKE PEOPLE DO COLD WATER THINGS TO
THEMSELVES COMING IN. DO RIDICULOUS WORKOUTS. AND, I REMEMBER READING
ONLINE THAT DON’T WORRY ABOUT ANY OF THAT JUST SHOW UP IN GOOD SHAPE AND
READY TO TAKE WHAT THEY THROW AT YOU. THAT’S ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO I
THINK. PEOPLE JUST GET WAY TOO WORRIED ABOUT “OH I’VE GOT TO WORK ON MY
UNDERWATER SWIMMING, OR MY BREATH HOLD”. LIKE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
PERFECT. EVENTUALLY THERE’S SOMETHING THAT YOU’RE NOT GOOD AT. EVERYBODY
RUNS INTO SOMETHING THEY’RE NOT GOOD AT.

WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S? IS THIS YOUR FIRST CLASS OR WERE YOU ROLLED?

I checked into the command June 28th. I started BO in August with 339.
So I’ve been with this class the entire time. I have not been rolled.
Yeah we started August… early August I don’t know the date.

WOW, OKAY. SO I AM GOING TO ASK YOU SOME BACKGROUND QUESTIONS BECAUSE
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT MAKES PEOPLE STAY THROUGH HERE

Yeah

SO WHAT ABOUT YOUR SIBLINGS? HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE? WHAT’S THE
BIRTH ORDER?

I have a little brother, I am the youngest.. I mean he’s the youngest,
I am the oldest. There’s one sibling. Uhm, we’re not pretty similar.
He swims at Georgia Tech and he’s a computer science major.

OKAY, AND WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, DIVORCED, OR SEPARATED?

My parents were married until the 8th grade then they got divorced.

AND WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?
WHATEVER YOU DETERMINE ARE LIFE CHANGING EVENTS?

I mean I just think I had… I don’t think there was one life changing
event like… I just went to school and uhh at school I was walking off
there were guys uhh I went to Virginia Tech there was a strong Army base
there and they were like not an actual base but there is a strong Army
program there. So they just had like a lot of mentors that kind of like
helped me prepare for this.

SO, ARE YOU ROTC OR…?

Yeah I was ROTC, it was more just like a group of friends and we would
train together. And uhh, like were like still really close today and
some are here in this pipeline and uhm similar pipelines in the Army. I
wouldn’t say that was a life changing event but that definitely impacted
who I was

AND HOW DID THAT EXPERIENCE HELP YOU WITH WHAT YOU’RE GOING THROUGH
HERE?

I mean A, when you’re just looking at BUD/S you’re not just like hey I
wanna make it through BUD/S it's like hey let's go to BUD/S and crush it
and it was never a question like am I going to quit. It was like how
well you can do on an evolution ya know like people come in with the
mindset I don’t need to quit and I think the mindset I learned there is
we were always trying to beat each other and compete. So like I just
looked at the rest of my class with competition and its like hey I am
going to try to beat you guys. Never once was like I don’t want to do
this. Ya know to an extent when you’re like hey hit the surf like that
sucks but you’re never like oh I am going to quit. It is now a
competition, like this surf hit is now a competition, this dive is now a
competition, this shooting range is now a competition. That helped me
because I have always been a very competitive person so I was just like
trying to win and beat everyone else.

AND DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY HELPED WITH YOUR PROGRESSION THROUGH
BUD/S AND WIN YOU SAID YOU WERE VERY COMPETITIVE?

I think so, uhm, uhh… I am not really sure. I mean yeah I guess.

NOW DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED TO YOU WANTING TO BE A SEAL? DO
YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY OR FRIENDS IN THE MILITARY? OR WAS IT YOUR ROTC
EXPERIENCE?

Uhm, definitely, so my cousin went to the Naval Academy, he’s a pilot in
the Marine Corps, he’s a test pilot. So I kinda wanted a career in the
military and he’s a pilot uhm, so I thought I wanted to be a pilot and
then I remember reading about this and to me the coolest thing about the
Teams is the individual is very important but its the team that matters
most, ya know. It doesn’t matter how uhh… amazing an individual is like
they will not accomplish the mission by themselves like the only way its
possible if you sacrifice everything for the team and the team can
accomplish the mission. To me, that’s what drew me, like it doesn’t
matter how good you are theres always someone better than you. To me
that’s where I wanted to be, like just always… You’re never the smartest
guy in the room in any subject and that’s what drew me here uhh… And I
also think like special operations, I went the officer route, so I think
applying special operations to the battlefield is awesome you know it’s
just like very creative and thinking outside the box, its like you know
superior numbers are gonna when the battle and thats just not true at
all there is just so many factors that come into play and I think on the
officer side thats just really cool and like yeah we don’t get too shoot
as much and were not snipers or breachers, its a whole different MOS and
thinking about that and reading about it and like different problem sets
you know like commanders and senior enlisted solve and created vietnam
and WW2 with the OSS and now yeah pre and post 9/11 thats kind of the
career path I wanted to be apart of.

OKAY, SO YOU GRADUATED ROTC FROM VIRGINIA TECH?

Mhm

TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED, DID
YOUR PARENTS SPANK YOU, DID THEY GIVE YOU TIMEOUTS, WITH HOLD TOYS, WHAT
WAS THE NORM?

Uhm… my mom used to make me run hills when I was bad and beat our butts
I guess. Uhm… it was more like, man its been a while, uhh.. I think I
got timeouts but like I was a very avid reader so I don’t remember that
working. They were like go to your room and I was like okay whatever ya
know so I was like okay uhh… I got in school I would get in trouble. In
middle school I was in trouble a lot. Not for like, I’d just talk out of
terms and whatever uhh… I definitely think in like middle school I had
like problems with authority I guess but then in high school I was like
really squared away and like I kinda found this. I swam at a very
competitive level too so when like that ramped up I really didn’t have
like discipline or behavioral issues cause like your swimming like two
times a day, we were doing 12 practices a week you know that was my
life, uhm.

DID YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT IN YOUR CHILDHOOD YEARS?

Uhm… no, I grew up in North Carolina. So my dad worked, he was in the
military but he was like gone during the week, it was pretty much just
like my mom for the most part raising us. Uhm.. he just like traveled a
lot for his job he was like home on the weekends. He was gone Monday
through Thursday just about every week from like 5th grade, like till,
he still does that.

DID YOU SWIM AT VIRGINIA TECH?

Mhm

AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF YOUR LIKE PRIOR TO
BUD/S, DID YOU COME STRAIGHT FROM ROTC INTO BUD/S?

Mhm, yeah. So I think what helped to was like so I grew up white water
kayaking and rock climbing a lot. And uh… I can white water paddle at a
very high, pretty high level, uhm, and I think that had a huge impact on
my success here cause like growing up you understand like, it humbles
you a lot. To me it’s like you have to stay composed you have to calm
cause like the river will kill you. So I think growing up and also like
rock climbing and being like understanding that you can’t make mistakes
or if you do you’re gonna make them early on and not when it matters, I
think that had a, I think the combination of swimming, rock climbing,
and white water kayaking made me very comfortable in the water you know,
and especially when like pool comp came around it’s just like what
happens when you paddle, you get thrown under until the river lets go of
you, uhm.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? LIKE DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS OR
ANYTHING?

I have a tattoo. Uhm, at the time in college I thought it was cool but I
will probably get rid of it down the road. Uhm, but I wouldn’t say I am
impulsive… I think I think through decisions and if I make an impulsive
decision, I understand like, you know alright if that was a mistake I
will eat it and learn from it.

WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE HARDEST PART ABOUT BUD/S? THINK THROUGH YOUR
HARDEST DAY AND WHAT GOT YOU THROUGH THAT?

So I had like two, in my head, really hard days. The first one was in
second phase, I failed an O-course and I have never, that’s the only
event in BUD/S that I failed and uhm I was like a top runner in the
O-course, so that was like very humbling, I went from like the second
faster guy in the class and all of a sudden like randomly failing an
O-course. Uhm and that was just like humbling, I was like holy shit like
obviously I don’t fail O-courses but it just doesn’t matter BUD/S
doesn’t care, it just like humbles you no matter what you know it will
keep your ego in check you never know like around the corner you just
like, keeping that in check. You know the other and next I worked on it
and got faster on the O-course. Every single time I went to run it, it
went from like a calm evolution where I was like oh I am just chilling
this morning to like alright it’s game time you know so uhm that was a
hard day and then probably my other hardest day was on the island when
uhm… I pride myself in like planning ahead uhh I think that’s one of my
strengths and being able to think things through and think a couple
steps ahead to like see mistakes that i could make personally and also
that our class can make just to keep things rolling smoothly. I also
pride myself on doing everything I can to prepare for an evolution that
will make me successful you know, basically combatting the known knows
that I know could go wrong. When were doing a demolition exercise and I
totally jacked it up uhm… like did the tape job wrong and it wasn’t a
very good tape job like it was poor attention to detail their which I
pride myself on, I didn’t have enough tape with me so I was trying to
fix the tape job with the tap I had uhm because of that I guess I got
flustered and made a couple more mistakes setting it up and uhm and that
was hard because all it took was me paying more attention in the end
brief and I was worried about something else like I was worried about my
collateral instead of focusing on the evolution. So again you know it
kind of re-humbled me uh… that definitely like… that sucked uh… but
other than that idk like

BUT WHAT PRACTICES DID YOU LIKE DID YOU HAVE A MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL
PRACTICE DID YOU USE TO HELP PUSH THROUGH WHEN YOU HAD THOSE UNEXPECTED
THINGS TO HAPPEN, LIKE WHAT MADE YOU SO YOU DIDN’T PANIC WHEN YOU DIDN’T
HAVE ENOUGH TAPE OR WHATEVER?

Like in the grand scheme of things it’s like… so when I went through I
was just like blank that sucks I guess I was just like I gotta fix this
you know, I don’t have like an emotional reaction. I don’t ever like as
much as my close friends like I don’t think I have a low emotional
intelligence but it’s just like okay fix the problem, you know getting
amped up and worked up about it, at the end of the day I could have an
emotional breakdown and 30 seconds later once I come down from that I am
still stuck with the same decision so you might as well just ignore that
and fix the problem and move onto the next problem set. So I am very
good at staying calm uhm… and like I can keep myself in check while like
you know, I am pretty good at keeping my emotions in check.

OKAY, SO WHEN YOU HAD A DIFFICULT DECISION THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE EITHER
FOR YOURSELF OR FOR THE TEAM THAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH, WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND AND WAS THERE ANY ONE DECISION THAT YOU REALLY
STRUGGLED WITH?

So I don’t… In my peer evals that I got back I can make really hard
decisions I am not trying to like I mean my names not on this so I’m not
trying to like I mean it doesn’t matter, I can make hard decisions and
it's just like what’s best for the team and I pride myself in like it's
ingrained into me as an officer you have to like make hard decisions
that's what you get paid to do so like I never had a dilemma making a
hard decision so I was like here's a decision now what's the best
outcome for the team, going back to what I said earlier the individual,
yeah they matter but like not really. If this decision is going to hurt
like three dudes which usually a hard decision does like sorry guys you
know like and honestly those three guys at BUD/S and this isn’t in terms
of leadership, it's usually for guys who messed up like if they forgot
gear oh you know I don’t want to have to run back up to the range to go
get it and maybe it’s like maybe we can get it later and use a truck and
it’s like no dude go run up there you know, if I have to go with you,
fine let’s go get it so like the whole class doesn’t get in trouble.

IF YOU HAD TO BOIL DOWN YOUR SUCCESS AT BUD/S, YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW
PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T GET ROLLED OR DROPPED OR ANYTHING, WHAT WAS THE ONE
THING THAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL DO YOU THINK?

On paper I am not someone who sticks out but that's something to me that
fires me up and it's just like not in a bad way, I would love nothing
more than to beat someone who on paper looks like a stud and has been
handheld their entire life you know someone who went to the ivy league
or the naval academy, you know someone who their entire life has been
told how great they are. It's like alright let's go into a dark place
and get wet and sandy for a week and let's see if you can make hard
decisions not for yourself. I think what it boils down to is will power
and like I think the biggest thing is like one of my mentors like he
kind of does the same thing for the Army. He used to be the CO at Army’s
special forces selection and now he does PhD work for the Army on like,
he did a study on what is resiliency and how do you make that in special
operations soldiers We would have conversations about this and to me I
remember when I was applying to me the guys I train to with are like he
was leading the conversation cause he knew where my head was at and I
was like yeah man I don’t want to let the guys down you wanna perform
and he was like exactly and that’s what we find, hopefully you make it,
and this was like three years go, and guys that have done well in this
community they are more worried about letting their teammates down and
the team down over their own personal comfort and personal success and I
think that something that drives me the most 100 percent was like
especially when our hell week was secured with such little guys and like
yeah our class is bigger now, you don’t want to leave those guys you
know. Pre hellweek it was like a lot of competition and like I just
wanna win and like before I came here we was like every evolution when
your at BUD/S that will power that you have, if you don’t have that will
power to win at BUD/S how are you gonna have the will power to win in
the battlefield. He was like I promise you no matter how tired you are
at BUD/S it will be a joke compared to fighting like on the battlefield.
And to me every time I got tired underneath a boat or underneath a log I
just thought of like about one day I will be leading in combat and its
like I need to push myself as hard as I can so when we win may everyone
come home.

SO DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO QUIT OR HAD LEFT?

They just like were not aggressive to be honest they just like weren’t
aggressive and they just had this helpless attitude. Besides I don’t
really feel bad for the guys that quit, they honestly needed to go there
was like two officers who made like impulsive decisions they were top
physical performers and I think it was hard for them because I think
that the instructor got in their head and was like hey you guys are
failing your boat crew and your boat crew is failing because of you
which wasn’t true it’s just like they made an impulsive decision, at the
end of the day its just like I go back to making the hard call cause
okay if theyre making an impulsive call and that instructor can get in
their head then like do they not have the resiliency to be here, I am
just an O-1 so I don’t get paid to make those calls, but obviously the
pipeline works and I guess there like alright then theyre not supposed
to be here. I can still be their friends but you want the best guys next
to you.

SO HOW WOULD YOU SAY THIS HAS CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? ANYTHING?

Uhm yeah definitely like slowed down more uhm… not make anything on
impulse, slow down, take a breather and look at all my options. Very
attentive to detail uhm know when it’s time to go and bring the heat but
its controlled aggression you’re not just ever like outta control, I
think the way they like explained to us, its like 80 percent you know,
you;re moving fast and moving aggressively but in no way are you outta
control. So I think that's what I have also learned is like out on the
island, is that when you got a team uhm the most important thing is to
stay positive no matter what you know its like that something I
regretted I wasn’t always like a positive guy but I think from a
leadership standpoint you have to use positive reinforcement because
everyone here is so self critical of themselves so like whatever I say
to a guy I know its not going to make him feel worse than what he is
feeling inside because like I do the same thing, uhm… the second thing
that I learned, like the biggest take away uhm… I don’t know I think
thats it.

“OKAY, THANKS. OKAY SO I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS. WE HAVE 15 MINUTES
TO GET THROUGH AS MANY OF THEM AS WE CAN. SO FAR I’VE BEEN ABLE TO GET
THROUGH ALL OF THEM SO...UMM..

 SO WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S?

WENT STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY. THAT WAS KINDA A
WAKE UP CALL I GUESS. ALMOST LIKE FIRST TIME OUT OF THE HOUSE SORTA

 SO HOW DID GOING TO THE NAVAL ACADEMY UMM FACTOR IN YOUR EXPERIENCE
AT BUD/S?

UMM SO THAT’S WHERE I KINDA LIKE HAD TO START THE PIPELINE I GUESS LIKE
UMM I GUESS LIKE IT STARTS YOUR JUNIOR YEAR AT THE ACADEMY, SO, AND LIKE
I GUESS I STARTED PREPARING LIKE WELL I PREPARED BEFORE I GOT TO THE
ACADEMY I KNEW I WANTED TO DO IT. I KNEW I WANTED TO GO BE A SEAL LIKE
UMM AROUND IT WAS, I WAS LIKE 15 OR 16 AND THEN HEARD ABOUT THE ACADEMY,
APPLIED AND THEN KINDA LIKE KEPT THAT GOAL OF LIKE BEING A SEAL LIKE AS
I WAS AT THE ACADEMY BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD DO BOTH AT THE ACADEMY.

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR PROGRESSION
THROUGH BUD/S?

UMM PEOPLE TELL ME I’M SORTA I’M, PEOPLE TELL ME I’M KINDA QUIET LIKE I
DON’T KNOW LIKE VERY LAID BACK PERSONALITY, UMM, SO I GUESS I DON’T KNOW

NO EMOTIONS SO PROBABLY WHY. DON’T REALLY REACT TO THINGS.

HEARD THAT BEFORE.

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING PART OF
THE SEAL COMMUNITY. DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR YOU

SO MY GRANDPA AND DAD WERE BOTH IN THE MILITARY. THEY DID, MY DAD DID
CLOSE TO THIRTY AND MY GRANDPA DID 20. THEY WEREN’T SEALS BUT THEY WERE
IN THE NAVY. ALWAYS KINDA KNEW I WANTED TO BE IN THE MILITARY. I DIDN’T

WAS GOING TO BE IN THE NAVY. UMM THEN I GUESS THROUGH THE BOOKS, THROUGH
MOVIES, I THINK I ACTUALLY HEARD MY GRANDPA ONE DAY HE TELLS SEA STORIES

FRIENDS THERE AND IT IS IT WAS PRETTY TIGHT KNIT BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS
*LOUD CRASH* WE, WE UH, IN AN ALL BOYS SCHOOL EVERYONE LIKE KINDA MAKES

TYPE OF MENTALITY SO YEAH I PLAYED FOOTBALL IN HIGHSCHOOL.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN YOUR LIFE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO
BUD/S?

YEAH I WAS AT THE ACADEMY.

AT THE ACADEMY. YEAH. SO YOU’RE STRAIGHT FROM THE ACADEMY?

I WAS THE FIRST CLASS OUT FROM THE ACADEMY.

 WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UMM.

SO THEY EXAMPLE THEY ASKED.

MORE INDECISIVE THAN ANYTHING.

INDECISIVE.

UMM THE EXAMPLE THEY GIVE IS WHETHER, FOR IMPULSIVITY, IS WHETHER YOU
HAVE ANY TATTOOS.

NOPE, NONE. NO TATTOOS. I CAN’T DECIDE I ALWAYS TELL MY FRIENDS I COULD
NEVER DECIDE WHAT I’D WANT TO PUT, THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE YET.

I’M ALMOST 50 AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE YET.

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? THINK ABOUT YOUR
HARDEST DAY OR EVENT.

IT WOULD BE… I THINK THE HARDEST PART WAS… FOR ME PERSONALLY IT WAS THE
BIGGEST THING I HAD TO CHANGE WAS I LOVE TO READ I, I READ THROUGH HIGH
SCHOOL ALL THE WAY GOING TO THE ACADEMY AND NOT HAVING TIME TO DO WHAT
YOU WANT. CAUSE I ALMOST, I ALMOST SAID THE GRIND, THE DAILY GRIND WAS
THE HARDEST PART, BUT IT WAS EASY WAKING UP EVERYDAY. YOU KNOW, EVEN
THOUGH YOU KNOW WE WERE GONNA GET BEAT AND GO AND GET WET AND SANDY.
THAT WAS STILL EASY. IT WAS EASIER WAKING UP HERE THAN IT WAS TO GO TO
SCHOOL AT THE ACADEMY SO I GUESS LIKE THE HARDEST THING WAS JUST HAVING
YOUR WHOLE SO THERE WAS JUST NO TIME FOR, FOR YOU TO DO THIN..DO YOUR
HOBBIES. YEAH PROBABLY A COMPOUND ANSWER.

 WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH?

UMM… I THINK...ITS ALWAYS BEEN A GOAL OF MINE UMM.. FRIENDS AND FAMILY
DEFINITELY A BIG PART. NEVER COULD LOOK MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, I GUESS
YEAH BEING AFRAID OF THE SHAME IT WOULD BRING, BRING TO MY CLOSE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY IF YOU KNOW I GAVE UP.

 WHAT PRACTICE SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, PHYSICAL ETC. DID YOU USE TO PUSH
THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

UHH I WENT TO CHURCH, I’M CATHOLIC, WENT TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY UMM
BEFORE EVERY BIG TEST GATE YOU KNOW ALWAYS PRAYED. UHH I ALSO DID SOME
MEDITATION, WIM HOFF, WIM HOFF MEDITATION, A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

WHAT IS THAT?

WIM HOFF, UHH, JUST BREATHING TECHNIQUES, UHH, I KNEW OF HIM AND DID
THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT COLLEGE AND THEN WE ACTUALLY GOT A CLASS ON
WIM HOFF HERE SO UMM YEAH DEFINITELY DID THAT FOR MY MEDITATION.

 SO YEAH, SO WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING WHAT
WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? WHAT DECISIONS DID YOU
STRUGGLE WITH?

UHH

THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY USE IS SOMETHING LIKE TURNING IN A CHEATING
CLASSMATE.

THE HARDEST DECISION...I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY JUST BASED, I THINK THIS
PROGRAM IS BASED ON REPUTATION AND YOU DON’T WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE GUY
YOU KNOW WHO CONSTANTLY MAKES WRONG DECISIONS ESPECIALLY LIKE I’M AN O
SO LIKE WE ALWAYS HAD TO MAKE A CALL LIKE ON THE LOG OR LIKE UNDER THE
BOAT UMM. I THINK..HARD...HARD DECISION WAS TRYING TO GET WITH A GOOD
BOAT CREW. LIKE A SOLID GROUP OF GUYS THAT I KNEW WOULD BE AT THE END OF
HELL WEEK. TRYING TO LIKE HUSTLE MY WAY INTO THEIR CREW TO LIKE...IS
THAT...LIKE I KINDA NEVER DOUBTED THAT I COULD MAKE IT THROUGH, BUT I
ALSO KINDA DOUBTED HOW STRONG I AM I GUESS LIKE EVERYTHING LIKE MY
ABILITIES TO MAKE IT THROUGH LIKE WHETHER I’D BE A DETRIMENT TO THEIR
CREW OR LIKE AN ASSET.

 SO WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

UHH...HONESTLY JUST...UHH LIKE THE...EVERYTHING THEY ASKED ME IS NOT
HARD IT'S ALL DOABLE IT'S JUST WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT. I THOUGHT THE
SAME THING LIKE PREPARING AT THE ACADEMY LIKE DOING SCREENERS DOING
SCREENINGS AT THE ACADEMY, PHYSICAL SCREENINGS LIKE I WAS NEVER LIKE THE
MOST PHYSICALLY FIT OR MENTALLY SHARP, BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO
IT I THINK IT’S WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE THERE MORE THAN OTHERS DUDES WANT
TO BE THERE.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE WHO DIDN’T MAKE IT?

UMM YEAH ONE OF THE, A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE DROPPED LIKE SECOND WEEK
DURING FIRST PHASE UMM HE SAID THAT HE DIDN’T, IT WASN’T WORTH IT
BECAUSE HE’D GOTTEN ENGAGED AND YOU KNOW DIDN’T THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT
PLACE FOR HIM AND I’M MARRIED TOO. BEEN MARRIED THROUGH BUD/S,
THROUGHOUT BUD/S AND I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID LIKE ALL BIG
DOG SEALS ALL OLDER SEALS THAT IN PASSING YOU KNOW, WHETHER WE WERE
WORKING OUT AT THE GYM OR LIKE IN A POOL I THINK WOULD ALWAYS SAY “IT’S
WORTH IT, IT’S WORTH IT” AND LIKE THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
MOTIVATOR KNOWING THAT IT’S GONNA BE WORTH AND THE GUYS THAT AREN’T HERE
PROBABLY LOST THAT SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH IT IN THE END. THEY’RE
PROBABLY GOING TO GO ON AND DO GREAT THINGS.

I’VE BEEN HOLDING ON TO THOSE. LAST COUPLE OF QUESTIONS UHH HOW DID THIS
EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

UHH IT KINDA OPENS YOUR EYES I FEEL LIKE UHH THIS PROGRAM LIKE JUST ME
AND MY OPINION, I FEEL LIKE WHAT THIS, WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES IS THAT IT
GIVES YOU BASICALLY IS A LIFETIME, LIFETIME OF LESSONS ALL BUNCHED UP IN
LIKE SIX MONTHS..AND.. YOU KNOW PART OF STRUGGLING TO EXPERIENCE
MENTALLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME AND HERE ITS
KINDA CONDENSED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD’VE ASKED THAT HELPED OR HURT
YOU ABOUT BUD/S?

SOMETHING THAT HURT ME LIKE UHH...WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?

 WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD’VE ASKED YOU ABOUT UHH THAT
HELPED YOU OR HURT YOU THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM?

UMM YEAH NO I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PHYSICALITY, BUT
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PASS ALL THE PHYSICAL TESTGATES, BUT
IT’S DEFINITELY UHH...KNOWING...HAVING A GOOD SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE
DEFINITELY HELPS, WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT OR WHETHER YOU THINK IT’S
GONNA BE WORTH IT IN THE END.

OKAY, THANK YOU.

THE JOBS I GOT SELECTED TO DO. SHE WAS LIKE WHAT ABOUT THIS AIRCRAFT
MECHANIC JOB? SHE WAS LIKE THAT SEEMS FINE AND I DID THAT. I LIKED
GETTING GREASY AND STUFF DOING A LOT OF WORK BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT. I WAS
JUST LIKE I CAN'T DO THIS FOR 30 YEARS OF MY LIFE. SO I WAS LIKE I
ALWAYS WANTED TO DO SOMETHING CHALLENGING AND AWESOME AND I KNEW THE
SEALS WERE OUT THERE AND I WAS LIKE I'M IN THE NAVY I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING THAT WAS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY HARD THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET
TO DO AND IF I'M GOING TO DO MY TIME IN THE MILITARY I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE SERVING THAT I'VE GOT SCARS FROM GOT LIKE
A YOU KNOW LIKE I DID A GOOD JOB

yea

I DIDN HAVE MUCH TO LOSE. I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT
ME HERE. THE FAMILY-LIKE ORIENTED TYPE OF COMMUNITY EVERYONE IS LOOKING
OUT FOR EACH OTHER AND NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND BEING SELFISH.
UMMM

speaking of family um tell me about your childhood when you
were little. Like how did your parents or your mom discipline you? Did
she spank you, did she give you a time out, did she make you do push ups
with holding toys?

UHH SHE SPANKED ME A LOT AS A KID UH SHE LIKE IT WAS UHH
SHE LIKE PUT ME IN SEPARATE ME TIMEOUTS KINDA BUT SHE'S CHANGED. I KNOW
MY DAD DID THAT A LOT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

okay did you move around a lot when you were little

YEAH I ACTUALLY DID.

Tell me about your teenage years. Were you in a sport or
close with any group of kids doing something?

I WAS ALWAYS BY MYSELF BUT BECAUSE I WAS BY MYSELF EVERY
GROUP WANTED ME AS A PART OF THEIR GROUP. I WAS ALWAYS KINDA DOING MY
OWN THING. I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY SPORTS GROWING UP BUT MY FAMILY NEVER
HAD MONEY FOR IT.

yea

SO WE COULDN'T LIKE AFFORD LIKE THE GEAR THAT I NEEDED BUT
I DID ALWAYS PLAY SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL SOCCER IM VERY COMPETITIVE

oh okay imagine that

YEAH

.what did you do for the first 5 years of your life prior to
BUDS? Like did you go to highschool or or straight to BUDS but it
sounded like you did other things in the navy first.

MHM FROM HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATED TRIED TO GET INTO THE NAVY
AND AT FIRST THEY TOLD ME NO BECAUSE I HAD CHILDHOOD ASTHMA BUT I GOT
WAVED FOR IT AND THEN I WENT TO BOOTCAMP WENT INTO THE NAVY AND THEN I
GOT STATIONED IN HAWAII FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN UHH I DID THAT THAT WAS
A LOT OF FUN THEN I TRAINED FOR THIS AND THEN I GOT ACCEPTED

SO EVEN WHEN YOU WERE IN HAWAII YOU KNEW YOU WANTED TO DO
THIS?

mhm

would you say that you make impulsive decisions?

I WOULD SAY 50/50 I DO A LOT OF IMPULSIVE DECISIONS I DON'T
HAVE ANY TATTOOS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT DON'T SMOKE OR DRINK BUT THERE
ARE SOMETIMES WHEN I'M JUST LIKE LETS JUST DO IT IM VERY SPONTANEOUS
WHEN I COMES TO THINGS BUT I ALWAYS LIKE THINK ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS
OF THINGS AND MAKE GOOD DECISIONS SOMETIMES.

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING OR JUST THINK OF ONE DAY THAT
JUST REALLY SUCKED HERE WHERE YOU THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THIS ISN'T FOR ME
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH?

I ACTUALLY HAD TWO OF THOSE DAYS ONE DAY I ACTUALLY CRIED
BUT THE OTHER DAY MY WORST EVOLUTION WAS UM LOGS UM IT WAS LIKE A VERY
GOOD GRIMY WORK OUT AND I LOVED IT BUT IT WAS REALLY HARD THE IMPORTANT
WAS THAT IT WAS FUN THOUGH I THINK LOGS EVERYTIME WE DID LOGS

you're not the only one to say that

YEA LOL

LOG LOGS

MHM UHH WHEN WE DID UP AND DOWN THE BERM AT THE END OF A LOG
WORK OUT I WOULD ALWAYS THINK LIKE I'D RATHER BE IN BED OR ID RATHER BE
DOING SOMETHING ELSE. THEN I REALIZE YOU KNOW I KNEW LIKE TWO GENTLEMAN
IN THE TEAMS THAT LIKE HE WOULD ALWAYS TELL ME I COULD DO IT ANYBODY
COULD DO AND THAT MAKES SENSE LIKE IF CHIEF COULD DO IT I COULD
DEFINITELY DO IT LIKE I WOULD THINK ABOUT UM ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD MY
BACK AND SUPPORTED ME LIKE I DON'T WANNA LET ALL THESE PEOPLE DOWN AND I
ALSO THOUGHT LIKE I DON'T WANNA GET ROLLED I WANNA KEEP GOING I DON'T
WANT TO DO ANY OF THIS AGAIN. THE SECOND TIME WAS THURSDAY OF HELL WEEK
WE HAD OUR SECOND NAP AND THEN WE WOKE UP AND THEN I TRIED TO GET OUT OF
BED I TRIED TO STAND UP AND I IMMEDIATELY COLLAPSED TO THE GROUND AND I
WAS LIKE OH SNAP I TRIED TO STAND UP AGAIN AND I COULDN'T MOVE MY LEG
AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE HIT THE SURF THEN WE TRIED TO HIT THE SURF AND I
WAS JUST DRAGGING MY LEG IN THE DIRT AND I HIT THE SURF AND THEY JUST
MAD US DO IT MULTIPLE TIMES BY THAT TIME I WAS LIKE THE ONLY PERSON BACK
FROM THE GROUP SO I WAS JUST LEGIT MAD AND CRYING BECAUSE LIKE THEY'RE
GONNA NOTICE IT OR THEY MIGHT DROP ME I WASN'T THINKING CLEARLY CAUSE
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THURSDAY SO NOBODY LIKE ROLLS NO BODY BUT MY EMOTIONS
GOT I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT THEN I HIT THE ICE BOAT AND MY EMOTIONS
GOT THE BEST OF ME LIKE I MADE IT THIS FAR I REALLY DONT WANNA GET
DROPPED OR ROLLED BECAUSE OF THIS MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE THAT'S NO BIG
DEAL WE'RE GONNA PUSH YOU THROUGH THIS WE GOT YOU AND I WAS JUST LIKE
THANKS MAN . AND THE INSTRUCTORS NOTICED ME TRYNA RUN AND I COULDN'T
THEY'RE LIKE YOU BETTER GET OUTTA THAT BOAT AND I WOULD LIKE TRY TO RUN
FASTER AND FASTER BUT THEY DIDN TPULL ME SO .

did you like finally snap awake or ?

. Yeah by Friday that's when I started to get emotional like
the majority of the day. I felt like I hit my wall but just kept going.

what practices did you used to get through that like mental
moral spiritual things or what did you think about besides you thought
about all the people you made it through you could do it though about
the people who supported you like did you say a prayer meditate anything
else that you can think of?

.um everytime I ate I always prayed even still I always pray
uhh help me do great and do good let this food nourish my body please
let it take care of my body and give me the strength to keep pushing
through and before we started anything i realized i'm always calm before
the evolution and everybody is always like nervous or scared. I don't
have a lot of events in my life. I've always been calm in stressful
situations. That really helped me out i always think about something
else or try to not have my heart race. Cause if they are nervous they're
gonna make me nervous and if i'm nervous then i already lost.

YEAH ABSOLUTELY, WERE THERE ANY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THAT
YOU HAD TO MAKE DURING TRAINING LIKE TURNING IN A CLASSMATE WHO WAS
CHEATING OR GETTING DRUNK WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT
DECISION.

UM I NEVER REALLY CAME ACROSS THAT BECAUSE I TRIED TO STAY
AWAY FROM THAT.

okay that's fine too how about what made you ultimately
successful in completing this a lot of people quit or got rolled or
whatever

I THINK HONESTLY I JUST APPRECIATED HOW I GREW UP

you appreciate what?

how i grew up cause it was just really rough growing up and
I thought it was normal so I always like to talk about what happens you
know its hard and it's physically demanding and everything but in my
mind i don't feel like it gave me reason to actually walk up to that
bell. I dunno I've faced a lot of challenges and everytime time I face a
challenge I'll just be like you know it's whatever, just move on
learning a lesson just keep going. I'll never like sticking on it or
letting it get the best of me..

So let me ask the question in an opposite way so what do
you think of the people that quit what they didn't have?

I FELT LIKE UM THEY DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES
KNOWING THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF DOING IT THEY JUST DIDN
THAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEMSELVES AND THEY LET FAILURE GET THE BEST OF
THEM.

thanks helpful and then how has this experience changed you
as a person.

UHHH IT DEFINITELY LETS ME KNOW THAT I CAN DO A LOT OF
STUFF WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT LIKE UM LIKE THESE 14 MILE RUNS AND
5 AND A HALF MILE SWIM I DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO THAT AND THEY WERE JUST
LIKE ALRIGHT TOMORROW WE'VE GOT THIS SWIM GOING ON AND YOU'RE GONNA DO
IT AND I JUST GET INTO THE WATER AND DO IT UNTIL I HAVE TO STOP. THAT
CHANGED MY I DUNNO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

okay so what should i have asked you the navy has asked us
to take all these interview to see what makes people successful at buds
is there anything i should've asked you? Thank you for contributing to
your success that I didn't ask for?

umm probably like the personality about the class because
depending on the class as a whole that's going to make the person feel
comfortable or uncomfortable inna class cause that weighs heavy on a
person's mind like ohh i don't fit in here or these people are alphas
and i'm not an alpha.

i heard this was rough. Did you roll from another class?

NOT THIS IS MY FIRST CLASS.

but i've heard this is a tough class.

IN FIRST PHASE WE WERE LIKE VERY CUT THROAT TOWARDS EACH
OTHER AND I DIDNT LIKE IT AT FIRST BUT I SEE WHY WE DID IT NOW BECAUSE
WE WERE TRYING TO WEED OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY STRONG ENOUGH

DO YOU THINK IT'S CHANGED NOW

AS FAR AS US BEING FRIENDLY TOWARDS EACH OTHER

YEA

yea! We're definitely friendly with each other. It's sorta
crazy we still have the same kinda mindset. The third phase is when we
became more of a family cosy type towards each other.
ALRIGHT I'M WITH PARTICIPANT NUMBERS, AH 268 AND THE TIME IS 1117, IT IS
10 FEB AND THIS IS COMMANDER LEDFORD AND ARE YOU GOOD WITH ME, AH
RECORDING THIS INTERVIEW?

YES, YES

AWESOME THANK YOU, I’LL GIVE YOU SOME SOFTBALL QUESTIONS YOU CAN GET
STARTED WITH. AH. DID YOU, UH, WHICH BUDS CLASS DID YOU START WITH?

THREE THREE FIVE.

THREE THREE FIVE?

YEAH

OK. ALRIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRACE THIS OUT AREN’T WE, HUH. AND
WAS THAT YOUR FIRST BUDS EXPERIENCE WITH 335?

YES, YES

AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH 335?

AH, HELL WEEK AH HAD SIX STRESS FRACTURES AND STRESS CHANGES IN UH MY
KNEES, SO I ENDED UP BEING PERFORMANCE ROLLED WEDNESDAY NIGHT AFTER
CHOW. AND WAS IN PTRR FOR A LONG TIME.

PTRR. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK ROUGHLY?

IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE SIX MONTHS.

SIX MONTHS, OOF.

YEA.

AND THEN, AND THEN YOU WENT TO WHAT CLASS?

AH, 339 SORRY. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) GUYS

OK, GREAT. AH, HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

TEN.

OK, ALRIGHT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO OUTLINE THIS BECAUSE I NEED TO
KNOW, AGES AND WHERE YOU'RE AT AND SEXES

OK. UM. START FROM THE TOP?

YEA.

SO MY OLDEST BROTHER IS 33.

SO, BROTHER IS 33.

AH, SISTER, I WANT TO SAY 31.

OK.

ANOTHER BROTHER WHO IS 30.

30.

AH, SISTER WHO IS 20-, ABOUT TO TURN 29, PROBABLY JUST TURNED 29.

OK.

THEN THERE IS ME AND MY TWIN BROTHER, WE ARE 27.

TWIN BROTHER.

YEA.

27. OK.

UH, THEN THERE IS MY OTHER BROTHER WHO IS 25. AND ANOTHER BROTHER,
(CHUCKLE) WHO'S 23.

23

SISTER IS 21.

OK.

AND TWO TWIN BROTHERS THAT ARE 17.

OH MY GOSH.

YEA.

17. THAT IS CRAZY. IT MUST HAVE BEEN AWESOME.

IT WAS FUN. IT WAS WILD.

TO BE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

YEA. FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE, BUT YEA.

(LAUGHS). UMM, PARENTS, MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

MARRIED.

THE WHOLE TIME?

YEA.

AND HOW'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PARENTS?

WE ARE A CLOSE FAMILY, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) VERY, VERY WELL.

BUT UM, LOOKING BACK TO, YOUR LIFE, WHAT KIND OF LIFE CHANGING EVENTS,
EITHER BIG PINNACLE EVENTS, THAT REALLY INFLUENCE YOU MORE THAN
ANYTHING?

UM, YAH, I WOULD SAY MY DAD. HE WAS A, HE WAS A CAPTAIN ON A, FOR A
SHIPPING COMPANY. HE ENDED UP, AH, HE HAD THIS, UM, HE GOT THIS THING IN
HIS EYES SO HE LOST HIS LICENSE FOR THE COAST GUARD. SO HE LOST, HE'S
NOT BLIND, BUT HE'S LIKE LEGALLY BLIND. AH. IT BECAME, I DON’T KNOW HOW
OLD I WAS, I WAS PROBABLY 10 WHEN IT HAPPENED. IT BECAME FINANCIALLY
HARD AND WE KINDA STRUGGLED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. AND THAT WAS KINDA LIKE
A NEGATIVE PART OF IT BUT A POSITIVE PART OF IT IS LIKE LOOKING BACK NOW
LIKE SEEING MY DAD GET THAT HIT. LIKE HE, YOU KNOW HE TOOK IT LIKE YOU
KNOW, HE TOOK IT ON THE CHIN AND HE WAS A GREAT DAD AND FIGURED OUT HOW
TO PROVIDE FOR 11 KIDS WHICH IS, I CAN'T IMAGINE NOW HOW HE DID IT. IT'S
PRETTY COOL NOW LOOKING BACK. THAT WAS A GOOD (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT HELPED YOU AT BUD/S?

UM, THERE WAS NEVER LIKE A POINT WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, BUT I THINK,
JUST THE WAY HE RAISED US, I DON’T KNOW, JUST LIKE HIS EXAMPLE, YOU
KNOW, SO YOU CAN PUT UP WITH THAT BUT WHAT HE DID WAS PROBABLY HARDER
THAN BUD/S SO, MENTALLY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED
TOWARDS GETTING YOU THROUGH THIS?

I LIKE TO LAUGH, AH I LIKE JOKES. I LIKE TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH.

HOW ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, UM, DO YOU HAVE ANY SEAL FRIENDS OR FAMILY,
MILITARY?

I HAVE TWO BROTHERS.

TWO BROTHERS, THAT ARE WHAT?

YEA, ONE IS IN THE TEAMS, AND ONE IS ABOUT TO CHECK INTO TEAM SEVEN IN
TWO WEEKS.

AH, SO TWO BROTHERS IN THE TEAMS, LOOK AT YOU. AND THEY ARE BOTH OLDER?

ONE IS MY TWIN AND ONE’S OLDER.

OH. SO THAT REALLY INFLUENCED YOU? WHEN THEY CAME IN HERE?

I THINK, LIKE WE ALWAYS, LIKE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, IT WASN'T LIKE ONE
DECIDED TO GO OUT AND DO THIS. WE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT, US THREE. I
THINK THEM GOING THROUGH IT MADE IT SEEM MORE ACHIEVABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE
HUMAN. YOU KNOW? I KNOW THEY'RE HUMAN AND THEIR WEAKNESSES AND
EVERYTHING ISN'T LIKE BEFORE IT'S LIKE YOU READ THE BOOKS YOU THINK
EVERYBODY'S SUPERHUMAN, BUT REALITY IS THEY’RE NOT, I THINK THAT HELPS.

BUT TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. LIKE HOW ARE YOU
DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? DID YOUR PARENTS SPANK YOU, WITHHOLD TOYS? WERE
THEY STRICT?

YES, THEY DID. NOT SUPER STRICT, BUT THEY’D SPANK US, MADE US WORK, DO
CHORES, FROM A FAIRLY YOUNG AGE.

HOW ABOUT, UM DID YOU GUYS MOVE AROUND AT ALL?

UM WHEN I WAS, WE ONLY, I ONLY MOVED ONCE WHEN I WAS LIKE FIVE SO.

WAS IT FAR?

UH I AM FROM HAWAII, SO IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT ISLAND, SO.

OH, WHERE? WHERE IN HAWAII?

UM, I WAS BORN IN OAHU AND THEN I MOVED TO THE BIG ISLAND, SO.

OH, WOW, SO YOU GREW UP ON THE BIG ISLAND?

YEA.

ALRIGHT GOT IT.

YOU BEEN THERE?

YEAH, I DID TWO TOURS THERE, BOTH TIMES, I WAS IN K-BAY FOR ONE TOUR AND
THEN PEARLE CITY FOR THE OTHER TOUR.

SDV?

YEA, FOR THE SECOND TOUR, I WAS A MARINE AT K-BAY. SO TEENAGE YEARS, AH,
DID YOU, PLAY ANY SPORTS, ACTIVITIES?

I PLAYED, AH, RUGBY, AH, IT WASN'T LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE IT WAS
LIKE A LEAGUE, I PLAYED THAT FOR,

WHAT WAS THAT?

RUGBY.

OH RUGBY.

I PLAYED THAT FOR THREE YEARS AND I, I SWAM.

SWIMMING. SO YOU WERE ON THAT COMPETITIVE TEAM?

YEA.

SO LOOKING BACK FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO COMING HERE, BUDS, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME, WALK ME THROUGH YOUR LIFE, THOSE FIVE YEARS BEFORE YOU WENT TO
BUDS.

AH, I DID THREE YEARS OF COLLEGE. I STARTED WHEN I WAS 19, I DIDN’T
FINISH.

WHERE? WHERE DID YOU GO?

AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII, STUDIED HISTORY, BUT I DIDN’T GET MY
DEGREE.

WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

UM, I, THAT’S WHERE I MET MY WIFE. UM, I WORKED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.
AND LIKE THE WHOLE TIME, I KNEW I WANTED TO COME HERE, BUT I JUST, I
GUESS, JUST DELAYING IT, I DON’T KNOW

SO WHAT DID YOU WORK?

AH, CONSTRUCTION.

CONSTRUCTION. HOW MANY YEARS DID YOU DO THAT?

ALMOST THREE YEARS, I GUESS.

THREE YEARS.

ABOUT THREE YEARS.

NOW THAT WAS IN HAWAII? IN OAHU?

YEA.

THEN WHAT?

AH, I CAME HERE.

AND THEN?

YEA, THE NAVY.

BUD/S

CORONADO FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

NAH, NOT REALLY.

TATTOOS, ANY TATTOOS?

(NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF BUD/S FOR YOU?
HARDEST DAY, EVENT?

UH, AS FAR AS LIKE A SINGLE EVENT, I THINK I REALLY STRUGGLED ON THE
CASEVAC, ITS LIKE THE, BUT HONESTLY I THINK THE HARDEST PART OF BUD/S,
WAS, MENTALLY, WAS PROBABLY THE PTRR, GETTING ROLLED OUT OF HELL WEEK
THE FIRST TIME, LIKE THAT WAS HARD.

WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH IT?

I GUESS, PART PART OF IT WAS FAMILY, THEY HELD THEIR ENCOURAGING, AND
THEN I DIDN’T WANT TO GO TO THE FLEET, SO(LAUGHS). I, I KIND OF FELT
LIKE I ONLY HAD ONE WAY FORWARD.

WHAT PRACTICES, UM, DID YOU PRACTICE ANYTHING LIKE ON A DAILY BASIS LIKE
SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, PHYSICAL?

UH I’M CHRISTIAN SO I, I PRAY AND OBVIOUSLY I’D WORKOUT AND GOT A GOOD
ROUTINE.

DID YOU DO THAT EVERY DAY, DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DID THAT EVERY DAY, HOW
LONG?

UM ALMOST EVERY DAY, ESPECIALLY IN FIRST PHASE OF THE SECOND CLASS
CONSISTENTLY, ITS JUST ABOUT PRAYING.

HOW LONG WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR?

JUST ONLY LIKE A COUPLE MINUTES IN THE MORNING, AT NIGHT, BEFORE I WENT
TO BED, (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

DID YOU EVER HAVE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DIFFICULT DECISION, LIKE AH, THAT
YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH, WHILE YOU WERE AT BUD/S?

AH, I DON’T KNOW, I HAVEN’T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

LIKE RUNNING OUT CLASSMATES, CHEATING?

YEAH, THERE’S, I NEVER CHEATED, THERE WAS. THE FIRST, MY FIRST CLASS I
WAS PRETTY LIKE NICE TO THE GUYS, THE SECOND CLASS I DIDN’T REALLY KNOW
ANYBODY, AND THERE WAS A GUY IN THE CLASS WHO, HE DIDN’T DO VERY WELL IN
HELL WEEK, I, YOU KNOW HE ENDED UP MAKING IT, BUT I DIDN’T, I PUSHED HIM
OUT ALL THE TIME. I’M, I USED TO BE A NICE PERSON SO IT WAS A SHOCK FOR
ME KINDA HONESTLY.

SO YOU PUSHED HIM KIND OF WITH THE INTENTION OF TRYING TO GET HIM TO
QUIT, MAKING IT HARDER?

JUST, YEAH, GET OUT OF THE BOAT. I WAS JUST, YEAH, TRYING TO GET HIM OUT
OF THE BOAT. HE WAS DRAGGING US DOWN.

AND THAT SURPRISED YOU?

YEAH, I DON’T KNOW. USUALLY A PRETTY NICE PERSON. GUESS IF I WAS LIKE IN
SURVIVAL MODE.

WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL AT BUD/S?

UM, I DON’T KNOW THERE’S PROBABLY SEVERAL THINGS, I DON’T THINK I HAVE
LIKE THE SECRET SAUCE, BUT, UM, MOST OF THE GUYS WHO, THE GUYS WHO CAME
OFF AS OVERHYPED USUALLY DIDN’T MAKE IT, LIKE, I DON’T KNOW. THE GUYS
WHO WERE LIKE ALWAYS SAYING THEY WERE SO HAPPY TO BE HERE, LIKE,
ALRIGHT, THEY USUALLY DIDN’T MAKE, I, I DON’T KNOW I DON’T KNOW IF I
HAVE ANY ANSWERS. I(UNINTELLIGIBLE). I JUST FOUND THE
BEST(UNINTELLIGIBLE).

DO YOU THINK IT’S CHANGED YOU?

UM, YEAH, KIND OF IN A BAD WAY, I, I FIND MYSELF KIND OF A LITTLE, A
LITTLE MORE NEGATIVE, GROUCHY, SHORT-TEMPERED. SO YEAH CHANGES. MORE
MOODY I GUESS YOU COULD SAY.(PAUSE) ALSO, LIKE, I DON’T KNOW, I JUST
SEEM TO, I DON’T HAVE AS MUCH PATIENCE FOR PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING
THINGS OR EVEN LIKE, I DON’T KNOW, EVEN LIKE WITH MY WIFE I CAN BE A
LITTLE MOODY WHEN I COME HOME, AND I’VE NEVER BEEN LIKE, I’VE ALWAYS
BEEN A HAPPY DUDE. I’M HOPING THAT CHANGES AFTER BUD/S.

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU THINK THAT I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU OR
THAT KINDA MADE A DIFFERENCE, EITHER HELPED YOU OR HURT YOU AT BUD/S?

HM, I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THIS, BUT LIKE SOMETHING
THAT REALLY MOTIVATED, IS MOTIVATING AND ME IS LIKE BEING AROUND GOOD
DUDES(PAUSE). THERE’S A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE HERE.

AWESOME. ALRIGHT, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, TWO SIX EIGHT.

THANK YOU SIR.

Ok, so I am going to ask you a series of questions and you can answer
them the best you can. So, when did you start your BUDS class?

I got here to Coronado August of 2019 and I started first phase in
September.

Is this your first … Is this your first BUDS experience?

Yes, this is my first time.



 (SIO): HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS.

WHAT WAS YOUR PARENTAL SITUATION GROWING UP?

UHH, MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED THREE YEARS AGO.

OK, WHAT IS … YOU HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS?

YES

WHAT SEX? OH, SO THEY ARE BOTH BOYS. WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED UP UNTIL?

YEAH, YEAH THEY WERE FOR PRETTY MUCH MY ENTIRE LIFE.

WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM?

IT WAS GOOD, STILL TALK TO THEM EVERYDAY. PRETTY MUCH EVERYDAY.

 WHAT IS THE BIRTH ORDER?

 WHAT IS THE GENDER OF EACH SIBLING? (ALIGN WITH BIRTH ORDER)

 IF YOU THINK OF YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES, WHAT MIGHT YOU DESCRIBE
    AS YOUR CRUCIBLE OR LIFE SHAPING EXPERIENCES?

NOT MUCH. UMM, I HAD A PRETTY GOOD JOB THAT I WAS IN. NOTHING
CATASTROPHIC EVER HAPPENED. NOT A WHOLE LOT, JUST AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I
WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEN I CAME HERE.

 HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S?

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UMM, I AM PRETTY STUBBORN, SO UMM, I CAME HERE TO FINISH AND I WASN’T
JUST GOING TO GIVE THAT UP PRETTY EASILY. SO, UHH, I THINK THAT WAS A
BIG PART OF IT.

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING PART
    OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY.

NO, UMM, MY GRANDFATHER, UNCLE, AND COUSIN WERE ALL IN THE NAVY. NONE OF
THEM WERE SEALS OR WORKED IN NSW. UMM, I DIDN’T REALLY KNOW ANY GROWING
UP. UHH, PRETTY MUCH I HAD HEARD ABOUT THEM AS A KID. UMM, PROBABLY JUST
MOVIES OR SOMETHING WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID. UMM, WHAT KIND OF GOT MY
ATTENTION ABOUT THEM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE OLDER WAS I HEARD THE STORY OF
NEIL ROBERTS. HE WAS UHH, KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN IN 2002. MY MOM WENT TO
HIGH SCHOOL WITH HIM. I THOUGHT IT WAS A COOL STORY AND THAT INSPIRED
ME.

 TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW
    WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR
    PARENTS PARENTING STYLE? (SPANKING, TIMEOUTS, WITHHOLDING TOYS,
    ETC.).

I HAD PRETTY STRICT PARENTS. UMM,

SPANKINGS? TIMEOUTS?

NOT SO MUCH SPANKINGS, BUT TIMEOUTS FOR SURE. PRETTY STRICT CURFEWS.
UHH, YEAH.

 TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU MOVE
    AROUND? DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A TEAM SPORT OR AN ACTIVITY WITH A
    TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY? (ASK WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT SPORT OR
    ACTIVITY WAS)

UHH, I GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD, BUT WE MOVED HOUSES.
UHH, LIVED IN THREE DIFFERENT HOUSES BEFORE I FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL.

YEAH, UHH, I PLAYED LACROSSE IN HIGH SCHOOL. UMM, I DID THAT YEAR ROUND.
UMM, THAT’S ABOUT IT FOR THAT. I DIDN’T DO ANY CLUBS OR ANYTHING.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE (PRIOR TO
    BUD/S TRAINING)? WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR
    EXAMPLE, DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

SO I WENT TO COLLEGE. UHH, I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON FOR 4
YEARS. UMM, PLAYED LACROSSE THERE. UMM, THAT’S ABOUT IT. UMM, AFTER I
FINISHED THERE, BEFORE I JOINED THE NAVY, I JUST WORKED CONSTRUCTION
PART TIME TO MAKE SOME MONEY BEFORE I LEFT.

WERE YOU IN ROTC?

NO, I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. JUST DID THE NORMAL COLLEGE THING.

DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

NO

DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

NO, NO I DON’T.

HAVE TO KEEP THESE TO 15 MINUTES. I AM JUST MAKING SURE.

 WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
    QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S)

UMM, OVERALL, I GUESS JUST THE GRIND OF DOING EVERYTHING EVERYDAY. VERY
LONG DAYS. UHH, KNOWING THAT THE NEXT DAY WAS GOING TO BE JUST AS HARD.
UHH, IN TERMS OF A SPECIFIC EVOLUTION I THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING THING
FOR ME WAS POOL COMP IN 2ND PHASE. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT ONE WAS GOING
TO END MY BUDS CAREER. I STRUGGLED WITH THAT ONE A LOT, BUT FINALLY
PASSED IT ONE THE 3RD TRY.

 WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH? DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE
    SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

YEAH, I DEFINITELY FELT REALLY SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP. ESPECIALLY MY
FAMILY. UHH, I KNEW THAT THEY SUPPORTED ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND I
JUST KNEW THAT I DIDN’T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. SO, UHH, I WAS JUST
GOING TO SUCK IT UP AND DO WHATEVER THEY THROUGH AT ME.

 WHAT PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL) DID YOU UTILIZE TO
    PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

UMM, I WOULD SAY I DID A LOT OF VISUALIZATION. ESPECIALLY FOR THINGS
LIKE POOL COMP. UMM, JUST CLOSING MY EYES, TAKING A DEEP BREATHE, AND
THINKING ABOUT WHAT I NEEDED TO DO. I WAS GOING TO DO IT. THAT WAS
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME.

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
    WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION?

UMM, I AM NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THAT ONE.

SO THE EXAMPLE THAT IS LISTED HERE IS TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASSMATE.
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

OH, UMM, I WAS FORTUNATE. I WAS NEVER REALLY PUT IN A SITUATION LIKE
THAT. UMM, I NEVER REALLY HAD ANY BIG ETHICAL DECISIONS TO MAKE.

 CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE?

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

I TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO PREPARE TO GET HERE. I DEFINITELY DID MY
RESEARCH BEFORE HAND. I DEFINITELY HAD A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT I WAS GETTING
MYSELF INTO AND UMM, I - I JUST WENT IN TO EVERYDAY KNOWING THAT TODAY
WAS NOT GOING TO BE DAY THAT I QUIT.

SORT OF JUST ONE DAY AT A TIME?

SORT OF, AND I - I JUST KNEW THAT I WAS NEVER REALLY WORRIED ABOUT -
ABOUT QUITTING LIKE EVER. I NEVER - UMM, I NEVER REALLY HAD TO TALK
MYSELF OFF OF A LEDGE. UHH, THERE WERE DEFINITELY PLENTY OF TIMES THAT I
DID NOT WANT TO BE HERE, BUT I MEAN, WHATEVER. YOU JUST GOT TO DO IT.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE
    IT? IF SO, CAN YOU DESCRIBE THOSE DIFFERENCES?

UMM, WELL, THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME GUYS YOU CAN TAKE ONE LOOK AT AND KNOW
HE IS NOT GOING TO UHH MAYBE JUST PHYSICALLY OR JUST KNOW THEY ARE NOT
READY. UHH, THEY ARE JUST NOT MATURE ENOUGH. OR JUST UHH, THERE
DEFINITELY WERE SOME GUYS THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME AND I COULDN’T - I
NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT THEY WOULDN’T HAVE.

THAT THEY WOULDN’T HAVE

THAT THEY WOULDN’T HAVE MADE IT. IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME I TOTALLY
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE. UMM, SO ITS KIND OF HARD BECAUSE IT
IS JUST A WIDE SPECTRUM. UMM, I WOULD JUST SAY MAYBE OUT OF THE GUYS
THAT DIDN’T, MAYBE THEY JUST DIDN’T HAVE REAL EXPECTATIONS. THEY DIDN’T
REALLY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THEY
DIDN’T THINK IT WOULD BE AS HARD AS IT WAS.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON?

UMM, UHH, WELL OUTSIDE OF THE OBVIOUS THAT I DON’T REALLY LIKE BEING
COLD AND WET ANYMORE.

HAHAHA

UHH, THAT’S THE BIG ONE. UMM, IT’S DEFINITELY THE HARDEST JOB I HAVE
EVER HAD. IT'S GIVING ME AN APPRECIATION FOR HARD WORK AND JUST BEING
ABLE TO WAKE UP EVERYDAY AND - AND UHH REALLY, UHH, REALLY GRIND.

SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU THAT HELPED YOU OR HURT
YOU ABOUT BUDS?

UMM, NOT REALLY. I THOUGHT BUDS WAS DIFFICULT, BUT IT WAS TOTALLY
DOABLE. I DON’T REALLY SEE ANY REASON WHY SOMEONE DECENT GOOD SHAPE
CAN’T MAKE IT. ANY ABLE BODIED DUDE. I THINK IT’S JUST WHETHER OR NOT
YOU WANT TO BE HERE. THAT’S IT.

OK, WELL THANKS.

NO PROBLEM.

SO YOU GREW UP IN OREGON?

I GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST UHH
CDR: ALRIGHT SO I'M WITH UM CANDIDATE NUMBER 3? GOT YOUR INFORMED
CONSENT, UM SO BASICALLY WHAT WE’RE DOING IS I’M JUST GOING THROUGH

OH YEAH WITHOUT A DOUBT

AND IT’S NOT SOMETHING UH WAS IT UNEXPECTED?

OH YEAH VERY HE WAS KILLED BY A UH DRUNK DRIVER

SORRY DUDE…

YEAH [UNINTELLIGIBLE] WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED

SO WHEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH BUD/S WHAT WERE THE
EXPERIENCES THAT MOTIVATED YOU, NOT EXPERIENCES BUT WHAT THINGS
MOTIVATED YOU?

UM I’D SAY JUST THE GUYS NEXT TO YA, OR THE GUYS NEXT TO ME THAT WAS THE
BIGGEST THING JUST SEEING THEM, IF THEY WERE HAVING A BAD TIME JUST IT
CAN’T BE THAT BAD OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO HELP OUT YOUR BUDDY YOU GROW AND
YOU FORM REALLY GOOD CONNECTIONS WITH EM SO LIKE YOU REALLY WANNA SEE
YOUR GOOD FRIENDS MAKE IT THROUGH AS WELL, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO
GET EM THROUGH

WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT FOR YOU GETTING
THROUGH, NOT JUST AN EVOLUTION OR ACTIVITY BUT COULD BE OVERALL LIKE
WHAT DID YOU THINK THE HARDEST TIME IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S?

I DON’T KNOW I’D SAY THE HARDEST PART WAS JUST GETTING BACK BUT UH I’D
SAY DURING LIKE PHYSICAL OR JUST OVERALL?

JUST OVERALL

I’D SAY JUST THE GRIND BUT UH

THE GRIND?

YEAH BUT IT’S NOT REALLY THAT IT REALLY WASN’T THAT BAD I’D SAY, NOT A
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR BUT IT NEVER MADE ME CONSIDER NOT CONTINUING, I’D
SAY THE HARDEST PART WAS JUST GETTING BACK

WHAT DO YOU THINK, YOU TALKED ABOUT LIKE THE GRIND, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT
WAS THAT KEPT YOU THAT MOTIVATED YOU TO STICK THROUGH IT WITH THE GRIND?

UMM I GUESS BEFORE I EVEN START WITH GETTING BACK, I GUESS THERE WASN’T
EVEN AN OPTION OF QUITTING, SO LIKE PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY I WAS GETTING
OUT WAS MY PERFORMANCE OR LIKE INJURIES, JUST HAD THAT EXPECTATION THAT
IT’S GOING TO GET WORSE OR SOMETHING WORSE IS GOING TO HAPPEN SO IT’S
NOT THAT BAD.

WERE THERE PRACTICES, LIKE ANYTHING YOU DID ON A CONSISTENT BASIS, LIKE
COULD’VE BEEN SPIRITUAL, COULD’VE BEEN MENTAL, PHYSICAL, SOMETHING THAT
YOU DID ON A NORMAL BASIS THAT WOULD HELP YOU GET THROUGH?

UM I WOULD SAY JUST HAVING A LIGHT ATTITUDE AND JUST NOT REALLY CARING
TOO MUCH ABOUT LIKE NOTHING TOO FAR AHEAD AND JUST LIVING IN THE
PRESENT, REALLY JUST STAYING RELAXED, I THINK JUST DURING THE TRAINING
OR EVEN ATER, STAYING RELAXED AND ENJOYING THE TRAINING WHEN I’M OFF

UM WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ENJOYING THEIR TIME GOING THROUGH BUD/S

OH YEAH EXACTLY, THE SMALL THINGS JUST TO ENJOY IT

WAS THERE A POINT AT ALL IN BUD/S WHERE YOU HAD TO MAKE SOME KIND OF
DIFFICULT DECISION?

YEAH I’D SAY UM PROBABLY HELL WEEK WHERE UM THERE’S SOME PEOPLE JUST NOT
CARRYING THEIR WEIGHT AND YOU JUST GOTTA PUSH PAST IT AND I LEARNED YOU
CAN TRY RUNNING EM OUT BUT LIKE YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE PACE

WHAT’S THAT?

YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE PACE WITH LIKE RUNNING BOATS OR WHAT NOT AND
SOMEBODY CAN’T KEEP UP AND IT’S JUST A SHITTY ASS SITUATION

SO WHAT ABOUT THAT WHAT KIND OF SITUATION DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT

UM I WOULD SAY BASED ON THE PERSON THAT WAS, IF IT WAS GOOD PERSON FROM,
IF HE WAS JUST HAVING A BAD DAY THEN YEAH OBVIOUSLY YOU’D TRY TO CARRY
HIM THROUGH THAT EVOLUTION BUT IF IT’S LIKE CONSTANT LIKE THROUGHOUT THE
ENTIRE PIPELINE THEY’VE BEEN SLACKING OR JUST BEING A TURD, ALRIGHT WELL
HE’S NOT CONTRIBUTING HE HASN’T BEEN HELPING WITH THE BOAT CREW, IT’S
TIME TO JUST KEEP PUSHING THROUGH, IF YOU CAN’T KEEP UP YOU CAN’T KEEP
UP THAT KINDA DEAL

AND SO WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS, WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN LIKE DID YOU
WHAT WOULD GO FROM THERE[UNINTELLIGIBLE] LIKE A DECISION?

OH YEAH OUR ENTIRE BOAT CREW WOULD JUST [UNINTELLIGIBLE] PUSH THROUGH,
GO FASTER

OH OKAY, THE BOAT CREW WOULD KIND OF LIKE PICK UP THE PACE?

YUP

KIND OF THE INTENTIONALLY LEAVE HIM BEHIND OR?

YEP, MAINLY IF THEY’RE LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE
DAY ONE, KIND OF JUST LIKE HANGING ON

SO WHY WOULD THAT WHY WAS THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION?

I MEAN YA UH YOU KNOW BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE GUY THAT’S HERE WANTS TO BE
HERE AND IT’S THEIR DREAM AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY’RE THEY’RE 100%
COMMITTED TO THE CLASS, THE TEAM, AND EVERY BODY ELSE, BUT SOMETIMES
THEY’RE JUST NOT AT THE TIME PHYSICALLY READY AND YOU KNOW LIKE
DEFINITELY SOME OF THEM ARE STILL AROUND BUT IT’S JUST NOT HELPING THE
CLASS

AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE A PART OF THAT TOO OR KIND OF AN OBSERVER?

KIND OF PART OF IT

UM WHAT DO YOU THINK THINGS THAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL AT BUD/S WHAT DO
YOU THINK THOSE THINGS WERE LIKE WHY DO YOU THINK YOU’RE HERE AND OTHER
PEOPLE AREN’T

I’D SAY PROBABLY JUST LIVING IN THE MOMENT AND THE BIGGEST THING IS
PROBABLY JUST NOT CARING TO MUCH ABOUT LIKE ANY BEATINGS OR JUST LOOKING
AT THE SMALL THINGS AND JUST HAVING FUN WITH IT, I JUST FIND THE HUMOR
IN EVERYTHING. THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING JUST, YEAH YOU’RE
GETTING HAMMERED AND YOU SEE SOMEBODY JUST MAKE A WEIRD SOUND OR
WHATEVER AND YOU SEE ANOTHER GUY [UNINTELLIGIBLE] GET HAMMERED AND HE’S
IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU, JUST LAUGHING AT THE SMALL STUFF

YEAH

THAT HELPED OUT, JUST NOT REALLY CARING TOO MUCH ABOUT ANY OF THE
BEATINGS

UM AND DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE GUYS WHO ARE NOT HERE
ANYMORE, WAS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM?

UM I’D SAY THE BIGGEST THING UH PRETTY SURE THE STRONGER GUYS OR GUYS
YOU THOUGHT WERE MENTALLY TOUGH, THEY MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY
THEY ACTED, LIKE MAY BE [UNINTELLIGIBLE] OR LIKE GETTING DOWN ON
THEMSELVES, THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR SOME OF THE
GUYS, OR NOT REALLY BEING PRESENT AND THINKING TOO FAR AHEAD

AWESOME, ALRIGHT, PERFECT, THAT’S AWESOME DUDE, ALRIGHT, I APPRECIATE IT
I THINK THAT’S IT I THINK THAT’S ALL WE’VE GOT

Yes.

Haha and your participation ID number?

Three zero nine.

Three Zero nine three, ok. OK. So easy questions first uh when uh when
did you start your BUDS class? Were you?

Three three three.

You were Three nine.

Yes.

Ok And then is this your first experience going through BUDS?

Yes.

OK. So you made it through without any umm hahaha.

Yeha, no rolls.

Haha that's hard to do...Umm how many siblings do you have?

Two.

Two. So what sibling, brother sister?

I have an older brother and a younger sister.

And then um how many years apart?

Three all uh three years up and down.

OK. And then what's your kind of parent’s situation? Two parent
household.

Yep, two parent household Married happily um yeah no issues.

For the whole time growing up.

Yep.

Ok. And what's your relationship with your parents like?

Very good. Strong.

Where are you from or?

I'm from Southern California.

Ok, San Diego? Or?

Orange County.

OK. Now are you. Well, I'll get to you know the results. And then did
you move around a lot or always?

Always grown in the same place through my whole life.

Um any life changing events that happened in your life prior to coming
to BUDS?

Well, what is considered a life changing event?

I mean, anything that I would think is kind of meaningful kind of shaped
who you are.

I don't, I don't I don't think so.

So nothing stands out.

No.

You know uh, either great, great highs or great, great lows.

Uh, Yeah. I mean, I mean, I grew up playing sports.

Ok.

Um up to college, so I guess there were, you know, but I mean.

Ok.

I don’t consider.

I'll Ask you more about that in a minute. Um how about Anything that you
think factored into your experience here at BUDS. I mean, cause not many
people make it through without so much luck without rolling.

Uh I think I know that this is what I want to do and I prepared for it
very well. I was very well prepared.

How did you prepare for it?

Um I ran a lot um I probably could've swam more more positive and more.
But I didn't really have an issue swimming. Uh I read a lot of books. I
talk to a lot of different people. I talked to a lot of people who had
gone to BUDS all the way through and I feel like I just gathered as much
information as they could. So my expectations were appropriate and
stuff.

OK. Now did you um. How did you do? How did you know people that went to
BUDS?

Um I had two friends that made it through BUDS.

OK.

Um And then just kind of through those networks, have some contact with
other people.

OK,

And just go down the rabbit hole to kinda give you a picture of what its
gonna be.

Yeah, ok

I was. I was never I was never surprised at BUDS.

OK. Because you've talked to so many people?

Yeah

Can you describe your personality a little bit? How do you think it
might contributed to getting through BUDS.

Uh yes, so I'm very I think the various eyes I have a really good sense
of humor um...I have a very close knit group of friends and we've also
made it all the way through with me. So I think that helps a lot...

And they were here in this class? Or they were

Yes.

And you guys met here or?

At boot camp.

OK.

Yeah.

And so I know we talked a little bit because it went into this. But so
what, you really made you want to become a SEAL?

Uhhh I read I read a lot of books when I was in like middle school, I'd
say, and...you know, to be honest, first, it wasn't so much that I
wanted to be a SEAL it was that I wanted to go to BUDS you know. I
wanted to go to BUDS.

Really?

That was like, that was the challenge and as I kinda learned moreI kind
of thought that that would be a good job and maybe even a profession I'd
find fulfilling.

Now did you did anybody in your family military?

Uh yes, my brother was in the army.

OK. Is he still the army? or?

No.

Anybody else um you were around?

Grandparents were in the army in Korea, but it wasn't like I I do not
come from a military whatsoever.

Ok Um what about um, and these are a little bit of questions but that
they kind of help play and eventually. How is your family discipline?
Was it strict family.

Yeah, my uh dad my dad was very strict about sports,.

Ok.

About uh preparation and training and all that stuff so I think that
probably carried over well.

And when you say preparation, training, what do you mean by that?

Meaning that he was very, uh very big on like the process.

Ok.

And I had to...very similar, uh I don't know, very similar to the
military in the sense that "Ok we're gonna started. We're going to do
these drills. We're gonna do this simulation.

Got it.

We're going to do X. We're going, you know, practice outside of
practice.

Yea.

And stuff like that.

Um what about uh discipline at home life? Was there uh time outs,
spankings?

Uh so my brother was kind of a problem child I would say

Okay.

So I was just kind of quiet and just did what I was supposted to do
cause I didn't want to give my parents more grief.

Yeah.

So I kind of just I always felt like an easy job, but like I just kind
of did what I was supposed to do because I was like, you know, even if I
did act out of line they probably wouldn't have it in them have it in
them to, like, discipline me so.

Hahaha um what about any, I think I asked you but, uh, any moving around
as a child or did you pretty much just stay in Orange County.

Yeah, I've lived in Orange County my whole life.

Um teenage years you said you talked, participated in sports. What
sports?

So I played football and ran track.

Ok they're kind of different sports to a degrees what was kinda tough to
both?

Okay, so my dad was really into me playing football.

Ok.

I was I was a pole vaulter in track. That's what I was about.

Ok.

And that's what I went to college for.

Ok. Did you kinda was it the one you preferred it more you so why?

I, to be honest I hated both, but I knew that track was a it was a means
to an ends.

Ok.

That I would get into a good school and college playing football was
(intelligible).

Um what about the last five years since prior coming to BUDS, what have
you done?

So I uh graduated college in 2017. And then I worked in Phenix
commercial real estate for about a year and a half.

Ok.

And then I joined the Navy.

Ok. So um even when you were doing commercial real estate, you know this
was what.

Yes.

You were gonna do.

Yes.

So what made you kind of do that?

I needed I needed time to train.

Ok.

For BUDS so I wanted to give myself that opportunity. So, you know, in
the meantime you need to have a job.

Hahaha You can't just support yourself.

Yeah hahaha yeah.

So uh tell me a little bit about anything when you did commerical
realestate. Was it tough to you? Did it make life worse?

Uh, commercial real estate is very much like a good old boys kind of
profession.

Yeah.

Um it's not like you just are there nine to five, its like its kinda
like BUDS where.

Yeah.

It's kind of a culture.

Yep.

In addition to being you know like your occupation. But I wouldn't say
that that was just like I would say that had a big effect on me making
it through here.

Yeah.

It just was happen to be like that.

Yeah.

Like I specifically chose...

That for that.

Yes.

What about training? What type of training would you do?

Um I would run 4 miles every other day. I would swim 1500 meters on
those off days. And then I would do some kind of leg workout every other
day. So swimming and running would alternate. And then I would lift on
the running days.

Ok um any uh mental and spiritual practice to prep you did?

So I um and so it's an additional to working commerical realestate I
also worked at a restaurant. Um so I would work seven days a week. I
would work easy seventy eighty, sometimes ninety hour weeks because I
want to save a lot of money. And in addition to training. So I think
that was the mental preparation where I would you know, I would go get
in the office at 6 a.m. and then I would leave the restaurant at like 10
p.m. and then I would go work out for an hour or two hours.

Um what about impulsive, do you consider yourself and impulsive at all?

Sometimes yep.

Can you talk to me a little bit about that?

Sure um...uh so I bought a I bought a, now this is 2 or 3 years ago, I
would say I am less impulsive now.

Yeah.

But like I bought a like used truck.

Mhmm.

It's a 1997 and sight unseen by from the state of Washington. And it
just showed up because it was before I moved out. My parents were just
like "Woah!, Like what's that all about?" I was like, oh, yeah. Um moved
to Arizona. I'm kind of like an impulse. Like I'm from Orange County.

Yeah.

And went out there and I was like, I'm gonna go to (intelligible) Um, uh
getting to work real estate was impulsive getting the restaurant job
inside that was I would say impulsive like there wasn't like any I
didn't have like, great reason to go do those jobs,.

Yeah.

Do those things specifically I just kind of signed up. So that's what I
wanna do know uh and then when I joined the Navy, my parents saw that is
very impulsive because they didn't know that I was they thought that I
had kind of moved on that.

Yeah

And then they were like, "Woah OK".

Hahaha now you're doing this

Yeah.

What about tattoos? Do you have any tattoos?

OK. So, yeah, I don't have I don't have tattoos but.

Ok.

Me and my buddies uh joke that the guys with the coolest, you know most
extravagant tattoos were the first ones to go.

Hahaha.

For some reason

Well there might be a reason we're asking that question hahaha. Yeah, I
don't know. We kind of kind of curious because there may be something to
do with that question. Um what about uh what do you think the most
challenging part of BUDS was

Uh so on paper, the most challenging thing that I thought at BUDS is
pistol qualification.

OK.

Um I didn't have any real problems with first phase I failed a swim, but
all but one swim pair passed that swim or I'm sorry, all but one swim
pair failed that swim. So everybody failed except for one pair. And then
I passed everything on first time, the second phase and then third phase
I almost went home for piston qual.

Ok.

I failed it twice. I then barely passed the third time. Um but I said
the most difficult thing was Hell Week.

Yeah. So what about Hell Week sucks so much?

What's up?

What about it sucks so much?

I was just cold and tired and just don't want to do it.

Yeah.

Basic physiology. I still haven't found a world character.

Hahaha.

And like infinite infinite strength in cardiovascular endurance.

Yeah. Nobody does.

Yeah.

What about um for both of those. I mean, what pushed you to geth through
when you failed with the swim qualification?

So a big motivator in BUDS is is uh a part for me at least is the fear
of failure over want for success?

Mkk.

Because if you get rolled, you can lose all your friends. Especially
with pistol, you literally you literally go home eight or nine days
before you finish.

Yeah.

Which would suck. Um...so yeah, I'd say that's a big one. Losing your
friends, I think was the worst thing and having to for me at least
really go into the class, have to see, you know, it would be fun to meet
a bunch of people, but like also you really, really bummed to see your
friends go on.

Yeah.

And like graduated guys you're are like.

So you're still there.

Still in BUDS.

So what is the group component um was that a big motivator for you?

I think. Yeah, I think uh that might be one of the subconscious things.
But I was like, I'm not...I don't understand what like I never like I
was never going to quit. But it like it wasn't like that. You know,
reality was I wasn't aware of that reality.

Yeah.

And I didn't think, you know, OK, like, this really starts right now
like I don't have to be here. And I mean, I think a lot, yes. I think a
big component say, well, my buddy still here so.

Yeah. Was there any like outward support um that help from kinda your
group uh?

Uh I don't think there was ever a like any like, come on man like I'm
like on my edge.

Yeah, yeah.

Like come back. No it wasn't like that. But by the way, they never trust
that those guys 100 percent of the time, even if they you get brought
back.

They know.

That they will. It was true when I've experienced it, too. No, I don't
think so. I mean, I think it's just again, I think it's like
unconscious.

Yeah.

Subconscious kind of the thing.

Just kind of knowing

Yeah.

There's people there. Um any specific uh practices that you utilize to
help you push you through this hell week or any other challenging.

Uh segmentation. I think everything I mean, it's like cheesy as it
sounds. I think everything that they just like the whole visualization,
arousal control goal setting and so forth. I think that.

Yeah.

All that stuff was like, I don't I don't like to admit that. Like,
that's like what really helps cause I think it's like, you know, you
want move.

Yeah just do it.

And so forth. But no, that's a totally helps.

So talk to me a little bit about how you segmentation.

What's up?

How do you use segmentation?

Uh it's kinda of an abstract thing uh for me, with the island since its
like, OK, we're going to wake up and we're going to run some more and
you're gonna break your right. I think and I think even now, like I
notice my brain doing this is like I used to, like, get really anxious
about things to come, like, oh, my gosh, seven weeks like I've noticed
now that I really just now I do it unconsciously. Where like I just my
brain can only do so far forward.

Yeah.

Like in the future...But it wasn't I was always like it's like a number
like you know BO and first phase it was like, you know, just like.

Cause you're thinking about.

You think you an infinite like amount of time. Today is an infinity of
time. You're like, oh my gosh, what a week this and a month of this.
It's why I don't do that anymore.

What do you think, um, is there a time where you had to make a difficult
decision about or wonder if it is kind of like a moral decision or an
ethical decision.

I think I think I think especially in first face, those decisions are
played out in a long in like over a longer period of time rather than
like.

Exactly.

And I like for example, I really like log PT or like you have a boat in
your head and you can kind of get away with, like, not carrying your
weight, and nobody will really know. and there was a lot of times where
like I really had to consciously be like, really? Because that weight
just gets transferred to your friend.

Yeah.

So those are like the kind of like the moral issues that I think that
that's what really weighs on people. Like if they do quit or if people
are quitting is that they like I its that they like I'm at my wit's end.
It's just that I can't really carry my weight that much. I feel like I'm
letting everyone down.

Um anytime you saw somebody else kind of make a make a bigger maybe a
moral decision and you had to decide whether to.

I mean

Speak up about that.

Yeah I mean, so it's called ducking boat.

Ok.

But like when we're like when your friend's head isn't on the boat,
that's when it might be. In my opinion, that's like a moral decision.

Yeah.

Cause like we got weight that gets transferred to the other people and
that like knowingly doing it and you're just avoiding the temporary
pain.

Yeah.

So it's like I'm I'm I'm uh forgoing the temporary pain and I'm gonna
transfer it to you guys so I can live comfortably, you know what I mean?

Yeah.

So to mean that's a moral decision. But to see somebody steal something
or I, I'd lie about something like you know, like I can't really
remember I guess.

No it's more examples like that. Why do you think you were successful at
BUDS.

Uh, it's weird to say that cause you go get your ass kicked the whole
time, and like you kinda come out the other end and you're like "aaaaah"
hahaha.

But you made it.

Yeah, uh yeah I think. Okay, so so the big one is my my body was
prepared I think a lot of your guys go away because their bodies break
i.e. shin splints and stress fractures. And that's because they just
didn't run enough even though, like they're like mentally hard enough
and strong enough to like make it. So like your body has to be able to
do it.

Yeah.

And I have very good joint movement. I am very flexible. I have very
good mobility. Both things I, I consciously worked on before I came um.
Strong, I have strong legs strong back it's really important to have a
strong core for like boats and logs was stuff that gets me like so many
people. So we started out I think at BO with one hundred fifty five or
so candidates.

Yeah.

And we finished Hell Week with 26 and it's not like almost like most of
those guys didn't quit most of those guys got rolled or performance
dropped.

Yeah.

With their bodies. And so that's about like right out of the gate as I
think it's something, you know, a lot of people think of like the
helmets on the ground are people that quit?

Yeah.

But I don't think that's like even the majority. Um, so, one, my my body
was prepared. Uh I think I think pole vaulting since I hated it so much
and football cause I hated it so much but I knew it was a means, well
pole vault specifically, a means to an end it really scared me. I really
hated doing it. But I think that doing that for several years, and like
being in that headspace of like this comfort six months of BUDS became
doable. Like I like I thought of it It's like one track season, six
months. Uh, yeah.

Anything different about those that didn't make it. I mean, other than
the ones, like, performance things.

Right.

But people that literally quit.

Yeah. You know, it is weird. The fleet returnees the guys that this is
the second time that at BUDS were some of like, like physically we're
like the best. Yeah. Like we're the highest performers period in like I
thought. No question. You know, I, I don't I don't I don't know why they
quit.

Yeah.

I think maybe that's the reason why I didn't. Because I yeah, I don't, I
don't know.

Um, how did this experience change you as a person.

Uh it makes you definitely more humble. That's for sure. Because at any
given point in my friend's and I talk about this all the time. So I did
really well in second phase quote on quote like on paper

Yeah.

But by no means is going to predict future success in BUDS you know and
like, because, like I of a sudden, third phase, like you know for the
pistol like it's it's relatively easy. It's not like OC-8 or Hell Week.

Yeah.

Or It's like it's like this a huge numbers of fit, like it's just like,
oh my gosh. All sudden I just. I can't shoot pistol.

Yeah.

And so all of my friends have the same stories. They excel in some areas
and it just naturally inclined to do well in some things, and then like
other things and then like they just like suck like random. And I think
that's because the curriculum is so diverse and exacting that you're
eventually gonna find your,and they told us that in BUDS, you're
eventually going to find something you suck at.

Anything else you think I should ask you either helped or hurt at BUDS.

No, No

Well Perfect

Thank you.

Yep, congratulations

Thank you. Thank you.

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,

   CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE?

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

   DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT
      MAKE IT? IF SO, CAN YOU DESCRIBE THOSE DIFFERENCES?

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
  PERSON?

Okay, I have a series of questions for you, um, and we’ve got 15
minutes, so uh, most of it has been running right around 15 minutes. Um,
so if you have any questions about the questions, or clarifications or
whatever, let me know. When did you start BUD/S?

I started BUD/S in August, 2019.

Is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yep.

How many siblings do you have?

I have four siblings. I’m the youngest of five, so...

You’re the youngest of five?

Yep.

Um, were they brothers or sisters?

Three brothers, one sister.

Can ya, Give me the, just so i can write it down, can you give me the
order, like brother sister brother?

Yeah. So it’s my brother Nate, my sister Paige, brother (inaudible at
58).

So three sisters - three brothers, one sister.

Yep.

And you’re the youngest?

Mhm.

What was your parental situation growing up?

Um. Both parents present. Good relationship with my mom and my dad. Um,
very blessed.

What is - err, so uh, you’re parents were married?

Yep.

And you had a good relationship?

Yeah..very good relationship.

What uh life-changing ex- uh events happened in your life prior to
BUD/S?

Um so my parents, my family moved to Ethiopia, we’re cause we’re
missionaries, when I was about 14 so probably say that was the most
formative experience for me. Came from a very small town, and then just
moving overseas and experiencing a whole another culture, and then kinda
going through the culture shock and having to reset all my relationships
and stuff, that was, pretty big for me, and opened up my uh horizons a
little bit, to see more of the world, from just small town america.

So how do you think that experience factored into your experience here
at BUD/S?

Umm, I think it definitely motivated me a lot. I was in East Africa, and
definitely heard a lot about like the spread of like Islam and a lot of
horror stories of what was going on with that, and that kinda motivated
me and my decision to come to BUD/S. Um so yeah, it was kinda my why,
was just hearing that stuff and wanting to be involved and do something
about that so.

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression
through BUD/S?

Umm I've always been stubborn, so haha that definitely helped. Umm..
yeah - I think that's like the biggest thing. I have always been kind of
a quiet stubborn dude, so it paid dividends here to just shut up and do
your job and not quit. So, worked out well.

So, describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL community and, what they have in parentheses is: do you have SEALs,
any SEALs as family members or friends, or do you have military family?

No uh I, no military members in my family so - just grew up watching
military movies and stuff and was always very appreciative of people
that served and thought it would be cool to serve myself and then like I
said growing up overseas a little bit really gave me a passion to kind
of defend the American way, and be a part of that.

So, how were you disciplined as a child? Spanking? Time-out?

Umm freely, haha yeah all of the above, spankings, timeouts, yeah.

Grounding? Anything like that?

Yeah, grounding, pretty much all the, all the traditional means.

Yeah uh all the, anything they can come up with. Did you move around a
lot uh during your childhood? I mean you moved to Ethiopia, but.

Yeah, no up until then I lived in the same house for the first fourteen
years of my life. Just moved over to Ethiopia, and then kinda came back
to the same area up to college when i graduated high school.

Where is that?

Grand Rapids, Michigan.

So, so you moved to Ethiopia, when you were like 14?

Yep.

Until you went to college?

Yep. I was there for four years.

Did you participate in any team sports in high school?

Yeah, a lot of them. Played soccer, basketball, volleyball, was on the
track team, uh cross country team - it was a small school, so if you
were ever athletic, you played everything. So.

What have you done in the last five years of your life prior to coming
to BUD/S?

Um I went to college - I got a chemistry degree. Uh met my wife, got
married, um the summer after graduating college. And then, worked as an
industrial roofer while I was getting ready to come to BUD/S.

So you joined the Navy specifically to come to BUD/S?

Yeah, yeah.

So how long were you in the Navy before you came to BUD/S?

About four months - two months at boot camp and then two months over at
Great Lakes at BUD/S prep, so.

Yeah, uh did you, is that something uh you worked out when you signed
up?

Yeah, so I was able to enlist with a contract to come here to BUD/S.
Most, most of the first time attendees had kind of similar deal with
their (inaudible). Enlisted and came here pretty quick.

Would you consider yourself impulsive?

Umm.. maybe a little bit. I haven’t made any like major life decisions
impulsively, but maybe in the smaller day-to-day decisions.

Do you have any tattoos? That's an example of…

Uh no, haha no tattoos.

Let me check the time. We’re supposed to go no more than 15 minutes.
What was the most challenging component in BUD/S? And it says just think
about your hardest day or event.

Yeah I think the hardest part of BUD/S is just when you, when you do
mess something up, or like when the class pays for something that you
messed up. Like, not even like the guys are going to give you a hard
time for it, but you just feel bad for letting down the team.

What motivated you - well - so not, it wasn’t any particular physical
or, um, event, um, that was particularly challenging? I mean all of it
was challenging.

Yeah, it was all pretty challenging, I wouldn’t say there was any
particular test gate that really stood out to me as being a lot harder
than any of the other ones. Um, it was kind of, kinda day-in day-out,
just grind.

Did you feel you were supported by the group?

Yeah, definitely. You become like family with the guys from the class,
so. I was a 39 original so I went through hell week with a lot of these
guys, became pretty close.

So what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, Etc. Did you use to help
you through?

Yeah, so I'm uh a Christian, so I'd go to church every Sunday and kind
of have a lot of support from that community at my church. I think
that's really been big for me to kinda reset on the weekends. It’s just,
spending some time in worship.

So when you made a difficult decision during training, what went through
your mind as you made that decision? Now, the example that they use,
that they put in the questionnaire, is for example turning in a cheating
classmate or something along those lines.

Yeah, I think for me the closest thing to that is just like in hell week
making the decision to stop supporting somebody and just decide that it
was time for them to go and kind of usher them out the door because they
were just going to get people hurt, so. Because, I mean obviously,
everybody here, your first instinct is just to help guys along, but then
it comes to a point when somebody's not gonna do their part then you
kind of just have to get rid of them. And then at that point, I guess
what went through my head was just the inevitability of the decision,
and doing what’s best for the team even if it doesn’t sit well with you.
Umm (inaudible).

Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?

I think I didn’t take anything personally and I never, I never got angry
about what they asked us to do, or like said it wasn’t possible. I
just...just decided that whatever they said we had to do, I was going to
do it. I kind of just made that decision beforehand, so I never had to -
it wasn’t like I was revisiting the issue and having to make that
decision every time. I just told myself that I was going to make it
through and do whatever they said to do, so. That was a big part of why
a lot of guys quit, is that they, the start of every evolution they
would try to make that decision again and again, rather. I made that
decision before I ever joined the Navy, so.

Spend a lot of energy questioning what you’re told to do. Did you notice
anything different about those who did not make it?

Yeah, uhh say like self-doubt was like pretty big with a lot of them. I
mean there's a lot of like humble guys here, but I think the trend in
like guys that didn't make it was just perceiving themselves as being
weaker than other people even if they weren’t.

How did this experience change you as a person?

Humbled me, probably.

Is there anything else I should have asked you, that I didn't ask you
about or that helped you or hurt you get through the program?

No.

Okay, I guess that's it. So. Yeah. Perfect timing.

WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE?

This is my first BUD/S experience, I started in August of 2019 in class
339 originally.

HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE AND WHAT’S THE BIRTH ORDER? OLDEST
YOUNGEST?

I have one older brother, so I am the youngest.

WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, OR DIVORCED?

Uh.. they were married for most of my life and now they are divorced

SO ONCE YOU WERE OUT OF THE HOUSE THEY WERE DIVORCED?

Yes ma’am.

WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER LIFE CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED TO YOU PRIOR
TO ENTERING BUD/S?

Uhm.. Ooh.. I think my parents' relationship played a big part in my
upbringing, uhh.. But at the same time I have had a lot of overseas
experience uhh… I was fortunate enough to travel in college and get a
job after University and I think a lot of that really helped me.

SO HOW DID TRAVELING HELP YOU OR FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE AT
BUD/S?

Uhh.. well, I will kinda answer that in two ways. On a more pragmatic
note, it was easy to recall good memories when going through
particularly unpleasant events so that kinda like put a smile on my
face. Uhh and another way, I got to see individuals who had a lot of
struggles in life compared to mine and it put things into perspective so
when I had one bad day on the beach or something I thought it was one
bad day and I can go back and sleep in a bed which a lot of people I met
overseas did not have that luxury so I thought my life really wasn’t
that tough at the moment and I should probably just keep going.

SO WHAT PART OF YOUR PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR
SUCCESS AT BUD/S? ANYTHING SPECIFIC?

Yes I am very stubborn and uhh.. I think that helped a lot.

NOW DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED TO YOU WANTING TO BE A SEAL? DO
YOU HAVE ANY SEAL FAMILY OR FRIENDS IN THE MILITARY?

So not necessarily military in my family but my parents were both law
enforcement and I knew from a young age that I wanted to be in the
military. I talked to my mom about this before coming here and she said
that she remembers my fascination from SEALs from when I was like 5 or 6
and she took me to a book store and there was a book that had SEALs in
it and from that point on I took that book everywhere I was. From that
point on I decided I wanted to be a frogman, so I picked up SCUBA diving
when I was 8 and that’s where I wanted to go but I never really knew any
SEALs growing up, I saw the book and thought they were cool.

TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD WHEN YOU WERE DISCIPLINED? DID
YOU GET A TIMEOUT WHEN YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG? DID YOU GET SPANKED OR
HAVE TO DO A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY?

I think it depended on if it was my mom or my dad to come punish me. I
think my mom was more like clever psychologically and she would like
take things away or give me a punishment I didn’t want. My father was
more like spanking or the belt uh… yeah.

DID YOU MOVE AROUND THROUGHOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS?

Uhh no so I was born in Virginia, but I only lived there for 3 years so
I don’t really have any memories. I was in South Carolina for my entire
uprising all the way through college.

WERE YOU ON A SPORTS TEAM WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE OR HIGH SCHOOL AND WHAT
SPORTS WAS IT? OR WHAT DID YOU DO THAT WAS A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY?

So that’s actually kind of where I am a little different, growing up I
was loner and didn’t really like team sports. Uhm in middle school, or
highschool I started playing football but it wasn’t really something I
was that into. Uhm in high school I played soccer and managed to become
captain of my high school soccer team. We were not very good so it was
definitely not based off skill. Uhm and in college I kind of found my
own path and in the beginning picked up boxing and mixed martial arts
and then found climbing and never turned back.

TELL ME ABOUT THE 5 YEARS PRIOR TO BUD/S, WHAT WERE YOU DOING? YOU SAID
TRAVELING, CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY SPECIFICS?

Absolutely, so I worked for a medical non-profit, it's an operation
called smile. It is based out of Virginia Beach. Uhm.. my job was a
program coordinator, so they do surgical missions, yes they do
maxillofacial surgery most cleft lips and cleft palates. So I would
recruit the doctors on the mission and do their logistics and I would go
and be the onground logistical support. So I did that for almost 3
years. Uhm which was incredible you know I got to go to some awesome
locations uhm I went to the Democractic Republic of the Congo, I went to
Malawi, Madagascar, uhh China 3 times.

DID YOU GET TO PICK WHERE YOU WENT?

No I got assigned. You can put preferences out there but, at the end of
the day you’re just assigned.

AND THAT CONTRIBUTED TO YOU SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE LESS FORTUNATE AND
HAVING MUCH WORSE DAYS THAN YOU WERE?

Mhm, there is one in particular that I can remember, it was in Congo. Uh
there was a man, he brought his son, he was very quiet and just stayed
in the back, you could tell he like didn’t really mix well with the rest
of the people there and their families and I went and got a translator
and talked to him and the reason was he was from a completely different
part of the country that we were not doing recruiting in and it took him
two weeks by boat to get there and this was his third try and the two
years prior he'd come to the mission site cause he heard about it but we
hadn’t had missions or they got cancelled and it took about I think
three months pay for the journey and he made this twice and failed and
finally the third time he came his child needed some surgery and I
remember talking to him and I asked him like why would you sacrifice so
much to come here for your son and he looked at as if I was a fool and
said it’s my son why would I not. I will never forget the power of that
man and his dedication. I honestly remember thinking of that during
first phase and I was like you know he showed a lot of grit and resolve
for his son and sacrificed a lot more than I did, ahh so.

DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? LIKE DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS THAT
YOU GOT IN THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

Ahh yes, I am a little impulsive, I do have tattoos that were kind of
spur of the moment. Actually I got two tattoos that were both spur of
the moment and uhh I kinda own that and then yeah I am impulsive to like
reckless behavior a little bit especially when it comes to like the
outdoors.

WHAT WERE THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENTS OF BUD/S FOR YOU? SO THINK
ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY EVER AT BUD/S? WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH
THROUGH?

Ahh, week 2 of first phase and it was the day we did logs. It was a
Wednesday or tuesday. Uhh..

SO WHAT MADE YOU GET THROUGH THAT TOUGH TIME?

Yeah that was my best friend, he quit right before that. Uhm I did know
what he was going through when he quit, then I did not do very well and
I had about 3 instructors screaming at me telling me I should quit uhm I
decided to quit but not until after lunch and I forgot to and I ended up
at the next evolution and I was like I guess im here. What got me
through? I think it was I’m stubborn, if I was going to go out it was
going to be their choice not my own.

DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

Ahh no, no, ahh i was not.

WOULD YOU SAY THAT TODAY YOU ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

Uhh more so but I think I have a lot of the scars from ahh from that but
yeah I think it’s changed a lot.

WHAT PRACTICES DID YOU USE TO HELP YOURSELF GET THROUGH LIKE DID YOU
HAVE ANY PHYSICAL OR MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL THAT HELPED YOU GET THROUGH THE
NEXT EVOLUTION?

Uhm I think self talk.

I ASSUME POSITIVE SELF TALK?

I mean yeah I think negative can also be empowering if you respond well
to it but yeah uhh both and goal setting I guess.

WHEN YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING BUD/S? WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND CAN YOU THINK OF ONE DECISION THAT YOU STRUGGLED WITH
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT HELPED YOU?

Uhh.. that's interesting, I can’t think of any specific instance or
instances that uhh

THAT’S OKAY, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT HELPED YOU BE SUCCESSFUL?

So I heard this a lot beforehand and I heard people say you either have
it or you don’t and that it is not anything else. Uhh I didn’t like that
explanation and I always thought there was something more empirical and
can boil it down to. I honestly don’t know, I laugh, cause everyday I
wonder if they’re going to figure out that I am still here cause uhm I’m
like I shouldn't be here uhm yeah imposter syndrome but also like
laughing because I am in company of such great guys and I just feel so
average and most things I just don't take for granite that I am here and
I try to just enjoy everyday but I have no idea why I am still here.

DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT QUIT OR DID NOT MAKE
IT? LIKE WHAT SEPARATED YOU FROM THEM?

I think they from the people that I know that quit are

LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND?

They just stopped believing in themselves or they just let it get to
them in a way that you have to think about. You have to accept that it
is not going to be very fun, you just gotta push on. If you let it like
eat you up its gonna be

HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

Uhh it definitely made me stronger. It shows your strengths and
weaknesses.

MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY OR…?

Uhh mentally, physically, no surely not. It shows your weaknesses but it
also allows you to play to your strengths when you see them come out and
it teaches you, it really shows you that it is not about physical
strength. It is all mental.

ANYTHING YOU THINK I SHOULD’VE ASKED YOU THAT YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP
PEOPLE INTERVIEWING TO GET IT IN HERE?

I think the people who were successful and something that I did that
also might have led to my success is taking ownership of your training
before you come here. I know the navy puts out a lot of information on
their own workouts ya know, but the guys who are here I think everyone
took ownership over their training and did their own thing and kind of
you know pursued their own workouts which is something that's translates
to which they own the program.

You weren’t here passively actively wanted to mold themselves to work
harder and if they had a problem they were active in fixing it opposed
to those that were told they had a problem and were waiting for it to be
fixed.

OK. IS IT OK IF I RECORD THIS INTERVIEW?

YES.

AND WHAT IS YOUR PARTICIPANT ID NUMBER?

SAY I'M PRETTY QUIET. UM, DON'T TALK A WHOLE LOT. I THINK, UM.

HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY, OR IS THAT UNIQUE TO THIS SITUATION?

I THINK IT’S. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY LIKE, KIND OF LIKE AN INTROVERT.
BUT, UM, I’D SAY IT'S. SINCE I’VE GOTTEN HERE, I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT

 LOTS OF SPEEDING TICKETS? ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

NO. I’VE NEVER BEEN PULLED OVER. NO TATTOOS. NOT YET. I DON'T THINK, I
DON’T THINK I WILL. UM.

ANY MAJOR PURCHASES WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT GONE INTO IT?

NO. UM, NO I'M ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING A CAR RIGHT NOW AND I'M
SUPER, LIKE, DILIGENT ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY STUPID MISTAKES
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, SO. OR DO ANYTHING CRAZY, SO. NO, I’D SAY I’M
REALLY, PRETTY DILIGENT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SORT OF STUFF, SO.

YEAH.

 WHAT ABOUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING
    COMPONENT OF BUD/S? OR WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF
    BUD/S? WHETHER IT WAS A SINGLE DAY, OR A LARGER…?

I’D SAY, UM, JUST THE, UH, RELENTLESSNESS OF IT. UM, THERE WAS TIMES IN
FIRST PHASE WHEN I’D, WHERE WE’D HAVE AN EXTREMELY HARD DAY, AND I’D BE
LIKE, WELL THERE’S NO WAY THAT IT COULD BE THAT HARD THE NEXT DAY. IT
WAS. SO. I’D SAY THAT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME.

 SO WHAT HELPED YOU GET THROUGH THAT?

UM, SAY JUST KEEPING A POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

WAS THAT, SORRY-.

THERE WAS NO, LIKE, SPECIFIC THING I WOULD DO. ANYTHING LIKE, ANYTHING I
WOULD SAY TO MYSELF IN MY HEAD. I DON’T KNOW I JUST KIND OF DID IT. AND,
JUST KEPT GOING.

ANY UM, WITH THE POSITIVE ATTITUDE, WAS IT, LIKE, MORE INTERNAL, OR WAS
IT LIKE, KIND OF COLLECTIVELY…?

DEFINITELY IN-, I'D SAY BOTH. INTERNAL AND, UM, BEING AROUND EVERYBODY.
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PAIN IS, UM, GOOD.

 UM, ANY PRACTICES THAT YOU UTILIZED TO GET THROUGH, UM, GET
    THROUGH BUD/S? WHETHER THEY WERE SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, PHYSICAL?

NO, I DIDN'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF STRETCHING. I'M NOT VERY RELIGIOUS. UM, I
MEAN, FOR ME I WAS JUST ALWAYS AT, AT THE END OF THE DAY, JUST ORDERING
A PIZZA FROM DOMINOS. THAT WAS MY BIG THING, SO.

 UM, ANY SORT OF, LIK,E MINDSET THINGS YOU DID, LIKE, THAT YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT? OR JUST?

UM, I’D SAY, JUST THINKING ABOUT MY FAMILY. I COULDN'T...JUST LETTING
THEM DOWN WAS PROBABLY THE ONE THING I THOUGHT ABOUT, UM. OTHER THAN
THAT, NO.

 WAS THERE ANY TIME THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION
    WHILE TRAINING AT BUD/S? UM, LIKE AN ETHICAL OR MORAL TYPE OF
    DECISION OR ANYTHING?

UM, NOTHING, NO, NOTHING HUGE.

ANYTHING YOU SAW, MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE LIKE CUTTING CORNERS AND YOU HAD
TO DECIDE DO YOU SPEAK UP? DO YOU (UNINTELLIGIBLE)?

NO. I’VE ACTUALLY, ONE THING I THINK WE DID REALLY WELL AS A CLASS WAS
NOT CUTTING ANY CORNERS. INDIVIDUALLY, AND AS A CLASS WHOLE, SO.

OK.

 UM, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

UM, I DON'T KNOW. JUST BEING QUIET, PUTTING MY HEAD DOWN, DOING WHAT I’M
TOLD. UM, BECAUSE, WHAT, I MEAN, EVERYONE HAS THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS OF
APPROACHING IT. I DEFINITELY UH, MY THING WAS JUST BEING QUIET, PUTTING
YOUR HEAD DOWN, JUST DOING WHAT YOU’RE TOLD, AND PUTTING OUT.

 ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU NOTICED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT MADE IT
    THROUGH BUD/S VERSUS THE ONES THAT SPECIFICALLY QUIT? NOT
    NECESSARILY PEOPLE WHO GOT DROPPED.

NO. I MEAN, GOING THROUGH BOOT CAMP AND EVERYTHING I’D, LIKE, I’D BE
LIKE OH THAT DUDE IS DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE IT, AND HE ENDED UP
QUITTING. AND THE GUYS WHO ARE STILL HERE FROM MY BOOT CAMP DIVISION, I,
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME I WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, MAYBE, I DON’T KNOW.

WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS, WAS LIKE IF YOU COULD PINPOINT SOMETHING? OR A
COUPLE THINGS?

JUST, CERTAINLY THE GUYS WHO ARE STILL HERE FROM MY BOOT CAMP DIVISION,
UM, AND THE ORIGINAL 339 CLASS, ALL SUPER POSITIVE DUDES, VERY SMART,
UM, JUST GREAT ATTITUDES.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON? IF AT ALL?

IT, DEF- YEAH, IT DEFINITELY CHANGED ME. UM. DEFINITELY HAD, I CAN’T, I
COULDN'T EXACTLY SAY HOW OR WHY BUT I FEEL, I’M DEFINITELY DIFFERENT
THAN FROM WHEN I, FROM WHEN I JOINED.

ANYTHING ELSE I DIDN'T ASK THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE GOOD FOR US TO KNOW?

NO. THAT WAS ALL GOOD.

OK. WELL GREAT, THAT'S IT.

AWESOME.

FINISHED.

THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, CONGRATULATIONS.

THANK YOU.
: RYAN HERRERA-MURPHY

DATE: 17AUG20

PARTICIPANT : 328

LENGTH OF THE INTERVIEW: 39

DO YOU MIND IF I RECORD THIS?

Yes.

It’s okay to record?

YES.

OKAY. I ASKED IT IN THE WRONG WAY. AND THEN WHAT WAS YOUR
NUMBER?

328.

OKAY. SO WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S? IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S
CLASS?

YES MA’AM, I’VE BEEN WITH 339 THE WHOLE TIME.

WOW YOU’RE A RARITY.

SNEAKING THROUGH.

Wow, that’s awesome. Um, how many siblings do you have?
Like older brother, older sister?

I HAVE ONE OLDER BROTHER AND ONE OLDER SISTER.

SO YOU’RE THE YOUNGEST?

YES MA’AM.

Were your parents married, separated, divorced?

UHH, MARRIED AND STILL ARE.

That’s also unusual. What life changing events happened to
you before you came to BUD/S? Whatever you think is life changing is
life changing.

UM, NOTHING CRAZY. I HURT MYSELF IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT
SLOWED ME DOWN FOR A BIT. I WAS-

LIKE BROKE A LEG OR-?

I WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL ON OUR HIGH SCHOOL TEAM IN A FREAK
ACCIDENT IN A GAME AND DISLOCATED ALL MY TOES AND FRACTURED IT IN TWELVE
PLACES. IT WAS WEIRD. IT, UH, SLOWED ME DOWN FOR A BIT. AND THEN COMING
INTO THE NAVY I HAD A BUNCH OF HARDWARE IN THERE AND IT FELT FINE BUT
THEY WANTED ME TO GET IT ALL TAKEN OUT, SO THAT HURT PRETTY BAD AND
ADDED ANOTHER 6 MONTHS OF WAITING.

Wow. So what did-how did those experiences factor into your
experience at BUD/S?

IT JUST MAKES YOU MAKE SURE YOU WANT IT.

SO WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED IN YOUR
SUCCESS IN BUD/S? LIKE WHAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR PERSONALITY?

JUST BEING A TEAM PLAYER. IF YOU DON’T- YOU CAN BE THE
STRONGEST GUY, LIKE BY EVERYBODY, BUT YOU DON’T WORK WELL WITH THE TEAM,
IT’S A NO GO.

OKAY. AND WHAT IN YOUR BACKGROUND MADE YOU WANT TO BE A
SEAL? LIKE DID YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY WHO WAS MILITARY, DID YOU
READ A BOOK WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE?

UH, NO MILITARY. UM, ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS IS IN THE TEAMS-
WELL WAS IN the teams, and that piqued my interest. Just knowing that I
could serve, be physically and mentally challenged, do something real
hard, and meet like minded individuals is nice.

OKAY. TELL ME ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR CHILDHOOD. HOW
WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? LIKE, DID YOU GET TIME OUTS, SPANKING,
A BELT-?

UM-

-withholding toys, physical stuff?

MY BROTHER AND SISTER WERE ALWAYS DOING WAY MORE THAN ME SO
I- SO I ALWAYS GET.. I DON’T KNOW.. MUCH SOFTER. BUT, IT WASN’T ANYTHING
CRAZY: GROUNDED. NOTHING PHYSICAL. I THINK I GOT SPANKED ONCE WHEN I WAS
LITTLE AND MY PARENTS WERE LIKE ‘NAH OKAY WE DON’T REALLY LIKE THAT’.

Okay. Did you move around a lot when you were a kid?

UM, BORN IN INDIANA, MOVED TO NORTH CAROLINA WHEN I WAS
REAL LITTLE, AND THEN MOVED TO SAVANNAH AND BEEN THERE FOR OVER 15
YEARS.

Military? No? Zero military-

MY MOM’S JOB HAD US MOVE AROUND A LITTLE BIT WHILE SHE WAS
IN SCHOOL.

Okay. And then what about your teenage years? Did you
participate in sports?

YES

And were you close with any teams that you were on? What
sports were you on?

UH, I WAS IN SPORTS EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE. I PLAYED
FOOTBALL, BASEBALL, RAN TRACK, WRESTLED, LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

THAT’S NICE. WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE?

UH, COLLEGE JUST INTRAMURALS AND STUFF. I HAD JUST HURT
MYSELF SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL, SO..

Ah, okay.

NOTHING TOO CRAZY.

Okay. Any teams that stand out to you as really intense?
Like, close bonds with?

MMM, HIGH SCHOOL WAS A LOT OF FUN-

Mhmm-

-JUST TRAINING AFTER SCHOOL EVERY DAY WITH EVERYBODY WAS
FUN.

Okay. What did you do in the last 5 years of your life
prior to BUD/S? So you went high school, college and then-

COLLEGE, AND THEN I HAD ABOUT MAYBE A YEAR WHERE I WAS JUST
WORKING, TRYING TO GET IN SHAPE AND THEN APPLY AND HAD SURGERY TO GET
THE HARDWARE TAKEN OUT BEFORE THEY LET ME BACK IN.

Would you consider yourself impulsive, like do you have
tattoos or do you like to binge drink or..?

UH, NO. I DON’T DRINK HARDLY EVER. MAYBE ONCE A MONTH. UH,
NO TATTOOS.

Okay. And what is the most- think of the most challenging
day you had here at BUD/S, the hardest day you had… What was that day
and what motivated you to push through?

PROBABLY OC8. I WAS ON MY LAST ATTEMPT AND HAD TO PASS OR
I’D GET ROLLED OR DROPPED.

OC8?

UH, IT’S ONE OF THE POOL DIVING TESTS.

.Uh huh.

OPEN CERT.

Okay, gotcha, and um what motivated you to keep going and
push through?

JUST SEEING THE REST OF THE GUYS- THERE WAS PROBABLY, OH I
DON’T KNOW, MAYBE 15 OF US THAT HAD TO DO OUR FINAL TEST, AND JUST
KNOWING EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ALREADY DONE AND I DON’T WANT TO GET ROLLED
FOR A SWIM CLASS.

DID YOU FEEL LIKE THE OTHER GUYS SUPPORTED YOU?

Yeah! Everybody always supported us.

What practices did you have? Did you have anything that
helped you, uh, push through, like, uh, meditation or spiritual, or..
Anything that you-

UH, I THINK JUST LIKE BOX BREATHING, THAT’S ALWAYS NICE.
SLOW YOUR HEART RATE DOWN, AND THEN JUST KEEP YOU FROM-

THEY TAUGHT IT TO YOU HERE?

YEP.

And you think it worked? That it’s helped?

YEAH, IT’S GOOD. IT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY HELPED, YOU
KNOW. SLOW YOUR HEART RATE AND THEN ALSO KEEPS YOU, YOUR MIND FROM
WANDERING, TO JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR BREATHING, JUST RELAX.

OKAY. DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT YOU HAD TO
MAKE AT BUD/S? LIKE, UM, RUNNING A CLASSMATE OUT, OR TURNING IN SOMEBODY
WHO CHEATED, AND WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU DID THAT?

UM, I’VE BEEN WITH A GOOD GROUP OF GUYS PRETTY MUCH THE
WHOLE TIME

Okay.

SO, IT’S BEEN PRETTY NICE.

Okay.

. Never had anybody dragging us down and the people who
physically weren’t as good are still nice guys, so we just keep ‘em
around as long as you can.

OKAY, UM, WHAT, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN
COMPLETING BUD/S?

GOT LUCKY, GOT A GOOD GROUP OF GUYS.

Well lemme ask you a different way, what do you think, did
you notice about those who didn’t make it? Um, do you see any
differences between the kids, the people who aren’t here?

IT’S PRETTY CLEAR, YOU’LL JUST SEE THEM LIKE ‘WOW, MY LEGS
HURT REALLY BAD’, THEY’RE NOT LOOKING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AND BEING
LIKE ‘SO DO THEIRS. I SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP GOING, HELP THEM’. YOU KNOW,
JUST WORRYING ABOUT THEMSELF, ‘I DON’T THINK I CAN KEEP GOING’.

That’s interesting. How do you think this experience has
changed you as a person?

.Mm, definitely don’t like being cold, that’s my-but, just
like gets you a nice group of friends that you can always count on, so
that’s nice.

Okay, so the Navy is trying to ask us to do this research
and these interviews so they can do a better job, we can do a better job
at picking who comes to BUD/S. Is there anything you can think of that
we should have asked you, or that we can ask people coming into BUD/S?
To pick a better group?

PROBABLY.. HAVE PEOPLE, THE STUFF IN BO, IF PEOPLE AREN’T
ABLE TO MEET THOSE, THEY HAVE WAY MORE TO WORRY ABOUT. SO MAYBE, HAVING
PEOPLE COME OUT AND RUN THE O-COURSE AND RUN IN THE SAND, LIKE A LOT OF
PEOPLE SHOW UP AND HAVEN’T DONE ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

REALLY?

IT’S JUST TOO MUCH TO DEAL WITH. LIKE HAVING NEVER SWIM IN
THE OCEAN, YOU COME OUT AND THEN SWIM IN CIRCLES BECAUSE YOU CAN’T SWIM
STRAIGHT. IT’S JUST SMALL THINGS THAT ADD UP.

OKAY. OKAY.

.They do it for officers. They should probably-

Okay-

-MAYBE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT-

Yeah. that’s- yeah. That is a good idea. I thought they had
it for enlisted, too. Okay. That’s very helpful.

OK, IS IT OK IF I RECORD THIS INTERVIEW?

YES.

AND WHAT IS YOUR PARTICIPANT ID?

340

OK. 340. SO, UM, EASY QUESTIONS TO START, WHAT IS YOUR BUD/S CLASS?

UH, 339.

YOU'RE 339.

BUT, UH,

YOUR ORIGINAL CLASS, I SHOULD ASK.

OH, 335.

OK. AND THEN, WHAT'S KIND OF, WHAT WAS YOUR BUD/S PROCESS?

UH, SECURED WITH 335, HAD A BROKEN FOOT. UH, TOOK A WHILE TO HEAL,
HEALED UP, CLASSED UP, END WITH 3-9.

OK, SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY CLASSES IN BETWEEN?

NO.

AND AT WHAT POINT DID YOU BREAK YOUR FOOT IN 335?

UH, IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE HELL WEEK.

OK. SO YOU, DOES THAT MEAN YOU START BACK AT THE BEGINNING?

NO, I SECURED AND THEN I JUST CONTINUED ON AS A BROWN, BROWN SHIRT.



 (SIO): SIBLINGS? HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO
    YOU HAVE?

I HAVE A TWIN SISTER.

OK. ANY OTHER SIBLINGS?

UH, NOPE.

UM, AND WHAT'S YOUR PARENT SITUATION? TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD?

TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD.

STILL MARRIED?

YEAH, STILL MARRIED.

AND WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR FAMILY CLOSE? OR?

YES.

 ANY LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENED TO YOU PRIOR TO
    BUD/S? POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, ANYTHING THAT STANDS OUT?

I'M PRETTY NORMAL. SUBURBAN UPBRINGING.

WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?

UH, BAY AREA, SAN CLARA, SO YEAH.

 UM, DID YOU KIND OF, HIGH SCHOOL, WHAT WAS KIND OF YOUR PROCESS?

HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, THEN CAME HERE.

 OK. AND WHERE DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

UH, PEPPERDINE.

OK. I KNOW IT. I DID MY MBA THERE.

OH! AWESOME.

YEAH, SO EXCEPT I WENT TO IRVINE FOR THE MBA, SO I SAY I PAID FOR IT,
PAID FOR THE VIEW, BUT WENT TO IRVINE. CAUSE I LIVED IN SAN DIEGO FOR
SEVERAL YEARS. YEAH, I KNOW IT VERY WELL. LOVE PEPPERDINE. UM, WHAT WAS
YOUR MAJOR?

UH, PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE.

REALLY? SO, MY UNDERGRAD IS IN PHILOSOPHY.

WAIT, REALLY? WHERE DID YOU GO TO UNDERGRAD?

UH, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, UH, BALTIMORE COUNTY, UM, SO YEAH.

AMAZING. EXCELLENT CHOICE.

YEAH. SO PHILOSOPHY, MBA, PHD IN ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP. VERY
STRANGE.

YES. BUT I THINK THAT'S LIKE, THE BEST WAY TO GO WITHIN ACADEMICS. I
DON'T KNOW WHAT MY NEXT ROUTE IS EITHER. IT'S LIKE, EH, WE’LL SEE.

SO YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE, I'VE GOT THE PHILOSOPHY, I'VE GOT THE
PRACTICAL BUSINESS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT A PHD IN ORGANIZATIONAL
LEADERSHIP IS CONSIDERED. SOME WEIRD SOCIAL SCIENCE. BUT THAT'S NOt WHy
WE’RE HERE.

 TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY, AND KIND OF HOW YOU
    THINK IT CONTRIBUTED TO GETTING THROUGH BUD/S?

UM, I LOVE TO LEARN.

OK.

UM JUST, BEING INQUISITIVE, AND FIGURE OUT A PURPOSE MINDWISE IN
RELATION TO HELPING OTHERS, AND UM, YEAH THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER I
THINK MAKE IT, UM, AN EASIER EXPERIENCE.

 NOW, WHAT ABOUT, WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO BECOME PART OF THE SEAL
    COMMUNITY?

JUST HELP. HELP AND LEARN.

OK.

I THINK THIS IS THE BEST ENVIRONMENT TO DO THAT UM, IN EVERY RESPECT.
LEARN ABOUT THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE WORLD, ABOUT MYSELF, AND THEN BE
IN A POSITION TO HELP THEM IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S, YEAH.

 NOW DID YOU COME FROM A MILITARY FAMILY AT ALL?

NO.

 KNOW ANY SEALS? ANYTHING LIKE THAT? SPECIAL FORCES? NO. SO WHAT
MADE YOU SAY SEALS VERSUS JUST ANY OTHER SPECIAL FORCES, OR ANY OTHER…?

UH, THE WATER.

OK.

I PLAYED WATER POLO AND I LOVED THE WATER, UM, AND, I THINK THAT WAS
JUST THE FINAL CHOICE WITHIN DIRECTION.

UH HUH.

UM, JUST WANT (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

 AND AT WHAT POINT DID YOU KIND OF DECIDE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE
MILITARY? I WANT TO BECOME A SEAL?

WHEN I WAS 11 PROBABLY.

OK. WHAT WAS THAT, KIND OF?

JUST, I WANT TO SERVE.

OK.

 UM, tELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. MORE
    SPECIFICALLY, LIKE YOUR PARENTS DISCIPLINE STYLE. WERE THEY
    STRICT? WERE THEY…?

UM, FAIR, STRICT WHEN NEEDED TO BE, LIBERAL WHEN NEEDED TO BE, Uh,
PLEASANT.

 WHAT WAS DISCIPLINE LIKE? TIMEOUTS? SPANKINGS?

TIMOUTS, SPANKINGS, UM, CONVERSATION. JUST DEPENDED ON CIRCUMSTANCE AND
WHETHER OR NOT I WAS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID WRONG AND
WHATNOT.

 DID YOU MOVE AROUND AT ALL DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD?

NO.

ALWAYS IN THE SAME HOUSE?

SAME HOUSE.

 WHAT ABOUT, TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS?
    TELL ME ABOUT THE SPORTS YOU PLAYED.

UH, PLAYED WATER POLO, SWAM, UM, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR SPORTS.

UM, WERE THOSE BOTH IN HIGH SCHOOL?

YES.

UM, ANYTHING ABOUT THEM, BEING PART OF THOSE TEAMS, THAT YOU THINK,
OTHER THAN THE WATER ASPECT, THAT HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR EXPERIENCE
HERE?

UM, I MEAN, IT'S A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT PLAYING WATER POLO. UH, YOU HAVE
TO THINK WITHIN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND YOU HAVE TO BE PHYSICAL, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME KNOW WHEN TO LIKE (UNINTELLIGIBLE). I MEAN IT'S THE SAME
WITH ANY SPORT THOUGH, IT'S LIKE FINDING THAT BALANCE OBVIOUSLY I THINK
THAT HELPS IN RELATION TO HAVING TO WORK WITH OTHERS. UM.

 UM, WHAT ABOUT IN THE LAST 5 YEARS? SO WHEN DID YOU GRADUATE
    FROM PEPPERDINE AND KIND OF, WAS THERE ANY IN BETWEEN TIME?

UH, SLIGHT IN BETWEEN TIME. GRADUATED IN WINTER OF 2017, WENT HOME. UH,
STARTED TO RUN, BECAUSE I HADN'T DONE THAT. BEEN IN THE WATER MY WHOLE
LIFE.

OK.

AND JUST WORKED ODD JOBS, AND THEN ENLISTED, AND CAME HERE.

AND WHEN DID YOU ENLIST?

JULY 2018.

OK. SO THEN BOOTCAMP AND STRAIGHT HERE.

YES.

 UH, WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE AT ALL?

NO.

 ANY TATTOOS, LOTS OF SPEEDING TICKETS, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

NO.

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
    QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S)

COMMITMENT AT BUD/S?

CHALLENGING COMPONENT.

OH. UM, BREAKING MY FOOT AND HAVING TO DO HELL WEEK KNOWING THAT I HAD A
BROKEN FOOT WAS, WAS A DOOZY. UM, BUT SURE BETTER THAN REPEATING IT ALL.
SO. I WOULD SAY THAT WAS HARD.

 WHAT GOT YOU THROUGH THAT?

UH, FAMILY, I MEAN I'VE LIVED A PRETTY PRIVILEGED LIFE AND I'VE HAD A
LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED TO ME. JUST WANTED TO, BE ABLE TO KNOW
THAT, GIVE BACK AND THAT it's NOT ABOUT ME TYPE OF DEAL.

YEAH.

AND KNOW THAT THERE'S KIDS AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING.AND, JUST PRETTY EASY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

 WHAT ABOUT, UM, SO, YOU HAD A BROKEN FOOT, BUT YOU STILL GOT
THROUGH HELL WEEK. I MEAN, WAS THERE ANY POINT WHERE, LIKE, I'M JUST
GONNA SAY I'M INJURED AND COME BACK AND, YOU KNOW. UM, aNYTHING THAT,
BEYOND FAMILY, THAT WAS REALLY THE DRIVING FORCE TO?

UM, WELL I'VE ALWAYS SEEN THIS AS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUEST.

YEAH,

LIKE PLATO'S REPUBLIC, THAT FIRST WE MUST BECOME A WARRIOR...
(UNINTELLIGIBLE). AND OBVIOUSLY.

LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS BROUGHT UP
PLATO'S REPUBLIC IN ALL THESE INTERVIEWS, BUT I LOVE IT, SO KEEP GOING.
SORRY.

THIS IS GONNA BE TANGENTIAL, BUT I GUESS I’M GOING DOWN THIS RABBITHOLE.
UM, YEAH, AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE PSYCHE OF THE INDIVIDUAL, AND
OVERCOMING ALL THESE DIFFERENT DESIRES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
YOURSELF, AND I THINK THAT RELATION TO KNOWING WHO YOU OUGHT TO BE, UH,
IS IMPORTANT THEN REMOVING YOURSELF FROM THE PHYSICAL EQUATION. AND
LEARNING WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE, AND THIS PLACE IS AN
EXCELLENT ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN JUST THAT. UM, I GUESS IN A DIFFERENT
NOTE, FOR A DIFFERENT ANSWER. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT,
BUT.

THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER. I WON'T FORGET THIS INTERVIEW FOR THAT VERY
REASON.

 UM, ANY OTHER PRACTICES YOU UTILIZED TO GET THROUGH BUD/S? UM,
    SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, PHYSICAL?

NO, I’m NOT SPIRITUAL.

 UM. WAS THERE ANY POINT UH, WHERE YOU EITHER HAD TO MAKE A
    DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S, LIKE A KIND OF
    ETHICAL OR MORAL DECISION, ABOUT, FOR YOURSELF, OR YOU OBSERVED
    SOMEBODY MAYBE CUTTING CORNERS AND YOU HAD TO, DECIDED, HOW WILL I
    DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION?

UM, NO I, I NEVER HAD UH, A PERSONAL ENCOUNTER WITH IT. OBVIOUSLY YOU
HEAR OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING SOMETHING.

YEAH.

AND THEN, BUT, NOT PERSONALLY, I HAD TO BE THE ACTOR IN THAT SPECIFIC
SORT OF THING. SO.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

FOR THE REASONS I LISTED ABOVE. HELPING OTHERS, AND WANTING TO LEARN.
AND OBVIOUSLY MY WIERD, MAYBE TAINTED, VIEW OF THE WORLD.

 UM, WHY DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT THROUGH, MADE IT
    THROUGH, VERSUS THE PEOPLE THAT, SPECIFICALLY, THE PEOPLE THAT
    QUIT, NOT NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE WHO GOT INJURED? WHAT'S THE
    DIFFERENCE I GUESS?

UM, JUST SIMPLE DESIRE TO FORGET ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT,
YOU DON’T EVER DESERVE A PAT ON THE BACK. AND THE PEOPLE THAT REALIZE
THAT ARE ABLE TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR, THEIR EMOTIONS. I
ALMOST FEEL LIKE THEIR, LIKE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND AMYGDALA TURNS OFF,
AND THEY LIKE, START TO UNDERSTAND.

YEAH.

I WOULD SAY, LIKE, MAYBE THAT'S MAYBE WHAT'S HAPPENING. UM, I'D SAY
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED-COMPLETING
    BUD/S-CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON, IF AT ALL?

Uh, hasn't changed me. I see this as just simply like an admissions
ticket, and I'm still in college and I have a long more way to go, and
hopefully I’m successful and have a job within this community and make a
difference. But, it's just something that’s necessary to do and no
different than completing anything else within the realm of what you
view as important.

Yeah. Anything else that I should have asked that I didn't ask? Maybe a
little more about Plato’s Republic.

I would love to have a conversation about Plato’s Republic.

I’m a, I’m an Aristotle fan personally.

I, I am as well. I am as well. Virtue Ethics I think is probably a
little bit more compatible with living than, than that. But within the
idea of this, I think it's, it's a fun thing to, yeah.

It is, it is. I have to dust my philosophy hat off a little bit. I’m a
little rusty. But.

I, I do too. But it’s been nice just being able to read a teeny bit on
the side and start to refresh myself.

Yeah. No it's a good thing. That’s, That's uh, my uh, next uh, task
when I finish pretending I’m a researcher. So, anyway it was great to
meet you.

Yeah, pleasure.

Thank you

Yeah.

Good luck

Thank you, take care.

UH AND SO YOU’VE SIGNED THE CONSENT AND DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO
RECORD?

YES MA’AM

OK GREAT AND CAN YOU STATE YOUR PARTICIPANT ID NUMBER

342

GREAT OK WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUDS CLASS?

UM I GOT HERE ORIGINALLY OCTOBER 1ST 2018 WITH 34 UM AND THEN I CLASSED
UP WITH 339 OR THEN I WENT THROUGH HELL WEEK WITH 37 UM GOT INJURED
AFTER HELL WEEK THEN CLASSED UP WITH 39 UM AND I’M NOT SURE EXACTLY THE

    YOUR PROGRESSION THROUGH BUDS?

UM I THINK UH BEING ABLE TO HAVE A A SENSE OF LIKE UH SICK SENSE OF
HUMOR LIKE IN THE TWISTED TYPE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH IS A HUGE FACTOR IN
IT UM SEEMS LIKE LIKE ALL THE ALL THE DUDES I-I’M CLOSE WITH LIKE THEY
ALL ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT IN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE UH THEY HAVE A WAY
OF LAUGHING THINGS OFF WHEN WE PROBABLY SHOULDN’T BE LAUGHING

OK UH SO THAT’S, DOES THAT HELP YOU, YOURSELF OR DOES THAT HELP THE TEAM

UM I THINK BOTH UM IF IF EVERYONE’S LIKE A SOLID MEMBER, IT DEFINITELY
HELPS OUT THE TEAM BUT UH LIKE DEFINITELY DEFINITELY PERSONALLY I-I
THINK IT HELPS MORAL WHENEVER YOU CAN JOKE ABOUT SOMETHING WHEN IT’S NOT
EXACTLY GOING YOUR WAY

UM ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR PERSONALITY

UM

LIKE ANYTHING CONSCIENTIOUS OR UH..

I DON'T THINK SO

EXTROVERTED OR INTROVERTED..

(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

LOSING SOMETHING, YOU KNOW

SO IT WASN’T NECESSARILY..

IT WASN’T LIKE

ESSENTIAL..

NO NO

OK

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? THIS IS A
    HOLISTIC QUESTION SO IT COULD BE YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT YOUR
    HARDEST DAY OR YOU KNOW WAS IT SORT OF WATER OR SOME OTHER
    CHALLENGE

UM I THINK THE UH I THINK RUNNING UM JUST CAUSE LIKE LIKE UH LIKE BEFORE
I CAME HERE LIKE I WASN’T LIKE NEARLY AS WELL TRAINED AS MOST THE OTHER
GUYS THAT COME HERE, LIKE THE DUDES THAT COME HERE ARE ABSOLUTE ANIMALS
AND I WAS NOT THAT UM SO I THINK LIKE RUNNING BECAUSE PHYSICALLY LIKE I
WAS NOT GOOD AT IT, DEFINITELY ONE OF THE WORST RUNNERS AND THEN
MENTALLY UM EVERYDAY LIKE WHEN YOU HAD A 4 MILE IT WAS LIKE LIKE I
SELLING MY SOUL FOR THAT 4 MILE LIKE IT WAS LIKE AT A HUGE PUT OUT AND
THE WHOLE REST OF THAT DAY WOULD JUST BE LIKE ME RECOVERING FROM DOING
THAT 4 MILE SO I THINK LIKE THE HARDEST PART OF BUDS WAS LIKE THE LIKE
SLICK 4 MILE RUNS WAS THE WORST PART

 OK UH SO WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH?

UM JUST WANTING TO PASS UM LIKE I LIKE I WAS CAPABLE OF PASSING THE 4
MILES OR IT WAS JUST LIKE LIKE IT WAS HARD LIKE IT WAS UH DEFINITELY A
PUT OUT FOR ME TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE

SO THIS IS ME JUST SORT OF GOING THROUGH WHAT I KNOW HERE BUT YOU KNOW
YOU QUIT BASEBALL WHEN IT STOPPED BEING FUN

MHM

YOU QUIT COLLEGE WHEN IT STOPPED BEING FUN

MHM

IT SOUNDS LIKE RUNNING WASN’T VERY MUCH FUN

RUNNING WAS NOT FUN

SO SO WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO TAP INTO

UM I DON’T KNOW UH MAYBE JUST LIKE (UNINTELLIGIBLE) UM JUST LIKE BEING
ABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT’S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 4 MILE UM REALIZING THAT
LIKE IT IS LIKE IT’S JUST A 4 MILE AND LIKE MY LIFE WILL SOON CEASE TO
BE JUST 4 MILE TIMED RUNS LIKE IT WILL BE BETTER

OK

UM I’D SAY THAT’S IT

SO HAVING (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

YES

SO DID YOU FEEL SO SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY INTERNAL MOTIVATION DID
YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP

ABSOLUTELY YEA UM I MET SOME OF THE GREATEST DUDES HERE UM LIKE BEST
FRIENDS LIKE ALL ALL OF THEM FEEL THE SAME WAY EVERYONE HATES 4 MILES
YOU KNOW IT’S NOT LIKE I KNOW IT’S-IT’S NOT JUST ME HAVING THAT IDEA UM

SO SORT OF A SOLIDARITY

YEA

OK EVERYONE’S SUFFERING

YES

 OK DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES LIKE (PHYSICAL OR MENTAL OR
    SPIRITUAL) THAT YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THESE HARD TIMES?

MMM

LIKE A PRAYER, A MANTRA OR A VISUALIZATION UM YOU KNOW SOME ATHLETES
BEFORE THEY GO INTO A GAME WILL HAVE LIKE A WARM-UP ROUTINE

UMM

ANYTHING YOU’VE USED TO..

*PAUSE* I WANT TO SAY NO BUT LIKE I’M I’M SURE THERE’S SOMETHING LIKE
UH….UM ACTUALLY YEA THERE WAS UH THERE WAS THIS MOVIE CALLED FURY UM
IT’S ABOUT, I THINK BRAD PITT’S IN IT, BUT THEY’RE LIKE TANKERS LIKE
BACK IN THE DAY I DON’T REMEMBER WHICH WAR

OK

UM BUT THEY ALWAYS SAID UH BEST JOB I EVER HAD

OK

SO MAYBE THAT

SO YOU SAID THAT TO YOUR-, SO YOU SAID THAT

OUT LOUD YEA TO MY BUDDIES LIKE IT WAS KINDA A FUNNY THING CAUSE
OBVIOUSLY IT SUCKED WE WERE SAYING IT’S THE BEST JOB WE EVER HAD AND IT
CLEARLY WAS HORRIBLE

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
    WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION AND WERE
    THERE ANY DECISIONS YOU STRUGGLED WITH FOR EXAMPLE RUNNING
    CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASSMATE?

UM YEA UH SO I WASN’T VERY BIG ON THE WHOLE RUNNING PEOPLE OUT THING UM
I-ORIGINALLY WHEN I CAME THROUGH LIKE IN 334 LIKE I WAS LIKE DANG THAT’S
LIKE ROUGH UM PRETTY M-MEAN IN MY LIKE OPINION I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A
VERY MEAN THING TO DO UM BUT IN-IN 37 WE LIKE WE DID RUN A COUPLE GUYS
OUT AND IT WAS UH LIKE IT WASN’T I DON’T-I DON’T KNOW WHY LIKE I THINK
IT WAS FOR LIKE A UH I THINK IT WAS MORE SO FOR MORALE BOOST FOR THE
GUYS WHO WERE DOING WELL UM BECAUSE LIKE THOSE ARE THE GUYS YOU WANT TO
KEEP UP AND THE GUYS WHO ARE LIKE KINDA BRINGING YOU DOWN YOU WANNA GET
RID OF THEM SO IT REALLY DOESN’T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE EVEN WITH THEM NOT
DOING WELL LIKE IT MAKES EVERYTHING HARDER BECAUSE LIKE WHATEVER LITTLE
WEIGHT THEY’RE CARRYING, THEY’RE STILL CARRYING SOME WEIGHT SO I THINK
THAT WAS JUST LIKE A LIKE A MORALE BOOST FOR THE GUYS WHO WERE DOING
WELL SO... CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN, I’M SORRY

SO HARD DECISIONS, SO THIS DECISION TO IN FACT YOU KNOW UH SHED THIS ER
CUT THEM OUT

MHM

RUN THEM OUT, HOW DID YOU COME TO THAT CONCLUSION TO TAKE ACTION TO DO
IT

OH UM I THINK IT WAS UM MORE SO DECIDED BY ANGER OF LIKE LIKE HEARING
GUYS I CAN’T KEEP UP OR LIKE LIKE LIKE THE COMPLAINING OF LIKE GUYS I’M
HURTING WHEN EVERYONE IS HURTING UM WHICH IS LIKE LIKE UH A POOR
ATTITUDE YOU DIDN’T YOU DIDN’T WANT TO BE AROUND ANYMORE ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU’RE LIKE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND TIRED AND STUFF LIKE UH I GUESS THE
NEGATIVITY THEY WERE BRINGING WAS LIKE WHAT DID IT FOR ME

SO YOUR DECISION TO YOU KNOW THAT-THAT IT WAS WHAT’S BEST FOR THE GROUP
OR..

YES, I’D SAY SO

 UH WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S AND
    THEN THOSE THAT DROPPED LIKE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THAT?

UM I THI-LIKE LIKE AGAIN I THINK LIKE BEING ABLE TO UH TO LIKE LAUGH
DURING THE HARD TIMES AND KEEP LIKE A LIKE A GOOD HEAD ON YOUR
SHOULDERS, UM NEVER TAKING YOURSELF TOO SERIOUSLY

LIKE A POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE

YES

OK AND THEN THOSE WHO DROPPED

I THINK THEY JUST GOT CAUGHT UP IN THEIR HEAD UM CAUSE LIKE I-I BY NO
MEANS WAS PHYSICALLY SUPERIOR TO REALLY ANYONE BUT LIKE I THINK BEING
ABLE TO BEING ABLE TO KEEP A GOOD HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS DURING TIMES
THAT’S VERY EASY TO LOSE YOURSELF IN THE BAD THINGS HAPPENING

 BONUS QUESTION - HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

YES

HOW?

UM IT’S..IT’S MADE ME REALIZE ONE GOING THROUGH HELL WEEK AND THEN
ALSO GETTING ROLLED THEN WORKING HELL WEEK LIKE LIKE PEOPLE ARE
CAPABLE OF DOING SOME INSANE THINGS AND WORKING THROUGH A LOT UH GIVES
LIKE GIVES YOU LIKE AN APPRECIATION FOR THE GUYS YOU’RE AROUND AND
LIKE THE LIKE THE CALIBER OF MEN IN THIS WORLD THAT ARE LIKE WILLING
TO DO THIS KINDA WORK, IT’S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

AND ARE YOU IMPRESSED WITH YOURSELF LIKE

UH

LIKE A CONFIDENCE BOOST

YEA I WOU-

OR IN AWE OF EVERYONE ELSE

LIKE LIKE I WOULD SAY SO IT WAS IT’S UH YEA I’M UM I’M HAPPY WHERE WHERE
I’M AT RIGHT NOW

OK UM ANYTHING ELSE I HAVEN’T ASKED THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE UH RELEVANT

NO

OK SO I’LL HIT STOP

Hey so uh this is uh relatively short interview about 15 minutes.
Questions are open ended but ya know if you can be somewhat concise
then we should get through all of it, but if we dont its not a big
deal.

Um so when did you start BUD/S?

I was actually class 330.

330? When, do you know, when was that?

That was in February 2018.

So this isn’t your first, is this your second?

This is actually my third, I got injured in Hellweek in 330 and got
rolled and got surgery than came back after over a year then in 337
made it through Hellweek but my foot was broken up so I got rolled two
classes after Hellweek.

So you sort of got rolled twice?

Yeah.

And how were you injured in 2018 in 330?

I uh had a labral tear in my hip and also damage to the (inaudible)

Oh ok. Alright so you joined with 339?

Yeah.

So How many siblings do you have?

I have two. Brother and sister.

Uh whats the ordering? Where are you?

Oldest

Youre the oldest?

Then sister.

So self, sister, brother?

Yeah

Uh what was your parental situation growing up?

Uh two parents, still married

Mom Dad?

Yep

And you have, do you have, what's your relationship with them?

(inaudible 59-11)

What, if any, life changing events happened in your life prior to
    BUD/S?

Uh I was in the Marine Corps uh I was an infantry officer, I deployed
twice. Two deployments to Iraq.

No Afghanistan?

(inaudible 35-43)

How did uh that experience, being a marine officer uh effect your or
factor into your experience here?

Uh I think it gave me a little bit of maturity, uh I had my feet
underneath me in the military, and it already kind of groomed me to
deal with hardship. And then i think it also for my deployments gave
me a sense of purpose. Got to work with seasoned SEAL team guys in
both deployments.

So uh when you left the Marines and uh joined the navy did you change
rank?

I was a captain in the Marine Corps and Lieutenant in the Navy.

So thats what the guy running this research project did right he
started in the uh Marine Corps and then came here. How do you think
your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?

I think I’m pretty good at dealing with failure.I think that kind of
helped me I didnt, mostly medically predicated issued that I had, but
I think that being able to uh persevere.

So when you were injured what did you do in the meantime while you
were injured?

I worked at the CTT, the Combat Training Tank, just at the pool.

Ok

Uh I worked for the BUD/S orientation the indoctrination stuff.

Um so describe your background um that led you to pursuing becoming a
part of the SEAL community? I mean is there anything other than you
mentioned you worked with SEALs overseas I guess and you have a
military background. Do you have any SEALs as family members or
friends?

I do not.

Any military family?

I do uh my father, and my grandfather.

Where they in uh

My father was in the Army, retired Colonel. And my grandfather was in
the Air Force Reserve.

So is that what motivated you to join the military to begin with?

Yeah I think so it was kind of what I uh all I knew as a kid. So I
think I wanted to do something in the military, and then special
forces spoke to me. (inaudible 43-49) so I ended up being a Marine
infantry officer.

Alright so some questions about your childhood. Um how were you
disciplined as a child?

Uh I think varying times throughout my childhood my dads temperament
uh my dad was more physical when I was younger and then he kind of
cooled off when I was older.

So you were spanked and then what grounded?

Perfect yeah

Did you move a lot as a child?

Yeah.

Yes you were an Army Brat right so. What branch was your father in? I
know he was in Army but what uh?

Corps of Engineers

Engineers? How disappointed is he that you're in the Navy? Uh so in
your teen years did you participate in sports uh or other team kinds
of events?

I did uh I played basketball, uh I wrestled for a bit earlier on then
I raced motorcross.

Motorcross?

Yeah

Any other kind of team activities? Like chess club or

Ah no

So the last five years have you, you’ve been in the Marines for the
last five years and you just switched to the Navy or?

(inaudible 05-10)

How long ago did you switch to the Navy?

So it was February 2018.

Would you consider yourself impulsive?

No

Do you have any tattoos?

No

Did you go to college? To ROTC or?

No I did uh Marine Corps Officer Candidate School.

After you finished your college degree?

No I did it while I was in college.

While you were in college?

(inaudible 53-57)

Whats your degree in?

Engineering Technology Education

What was the most challenging component of BUD/S either a day or an
    event or?

Hellweek.

Huh?

Hellweek.

Hellweek?

What motivated you to push through it?

Uh a lot of different things I guess if it boils down to one, one big
thing its the uh the ability to make a significant impact in the lives
of people overseas and I kind of experienced that with my first
deployment with the SEALs. That was very fulfilling.

What uh practices did you uh use to push through challenges like
physical, mental, spiritual, what techniques?

Uh I think the endstate visualization.

The goal?

Yeah

Visualizing the goal, achieving the goal?

Yeah

When you made a difficult decision uh during training, what went
    through your mind as you made that decision? Uh were there any
    decisions, specific decisions, that you remember having to make.
    Like examples they list are running a classmate out or uh
    cheating, turning in a cheater?

Yeah uh running a buddy a couple times running a classmate out of the
boat. Leveraging that against like class cohesiveness. Respective
implications to the class’ unity.

So I guess to some extent you have a lot of expirience that others
here don’t having been an officer a Marine officer, uh with making
those kinds of decisions. Thinking about unit cohecion versus hurting
someone.

Uh why do you think you were successful at completing buds?

I think it boils down to one thing I think uh the uh maturity and
perserverence, resiliency. That was probably predominatley cultivated
while in the Marine Corps.

Did you notice anything about anythything different, characteristic
wise, uh about the those who didn't make it through versus those who
did?

I havent really thought about that uh not really honestly.

Has this experience, and if so how has this experience changed you as
a person?

I think it has just augmented my ability to perservere.

Is there anything else that I should have asked you about that I
haven't that helped you or hurt you through this that I didn’t ask
you?

I don’t think so.

Ok thats it.

Thank you Sir.

Thank you.

SO DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO RECORD?

YES.

OK. AND IF YOU WOULD STATE YOUR PARTICIPANT I.D. NUMBER.

344

OK. AND WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S CLASS?

I WAS WITH THREE FIVE, 335. VIRTUALLY. I GOT TO CORONADO IN DECEMBER OF
2018.

AND... IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE?

YES.

 (SIO): SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT
    YOUR FAMILY. ARE YOU AN ONLY CHILD? AND-.

I'M AN ONLY CHILD.

OK, ME TOO. SO WHAT ARE YOUR PARENTS? MARRIED, SEPARATED…?

THEY SEPARATED WHEN I WAS LIKE FOUR.

OK. AND ARE THEY DIVORCED?

YEAH, THEY'RE DIVORCED.

AND WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH EITHER OF THEM?

I'M VERY CLOSE WITH BOTH OF THEM. THEY HAVE LIKE A GOOD- EVEN AFTER THE
DIVORCE- THEY STAYED LIKE FRIENDS, SO IT WASN'T LIKE A NASTY DIVORCE.

OK. SO FAMILY DYNAMICS. HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU SAY YOU CONTACT THEM?

UH, LIKE NOW? I STILL TALK TO 'EM MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK. NOT QUITE
EVERYDAY, BUT PROBABLY.

 SO HAVE THERE BEEN ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR
    LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?

UMMM, NOT REALLY.

SO YOU WENT THROUGH HIGHSCHOOL, DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

I DID. YEAH, I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR TWO YEARS. I GUESS THAT'S KIND OF IT
WAS KIND OF THIS. I JUST WAS IN COLLEGE AND I WAS WANTING TO COME TO
THIS AND KIND OF TOLD THEM I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE SO I HAD TO FINISH,
WHICH I KIND OF LIKE, KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO. AND I WAS PRETTY, YOU
KNOW, LIKE I WAS PRETTY SET ON IT. SO THEY WEREN'T THEY WERE HAPPY WITH
MY DECISION. OBVIOUSLY, MY DAD DEFINITELY TOOK IT WELL. MY MOM AT FIRST
WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT GONNA FINISH COLLEGE?", BUT SHE WAS GOOD WITH IT.
AND THEN I JUST LEFT COLLEGE AND CAME HERE.

OK. SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE COLLEGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POSITIVE FOR YOU?

YEAH, I ENJOYED COLLEGE. IT WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE I WAS KIND OF LOOKING
TO SEE WHAT I WANTED TO DO. AND NOTHING REALLY STUCK OUT TO ME BESIDES
THIS. AND I'D LIKE- SO SOMETHING I LIKE THOUGHT ABOUT GROWING UP, BUT IT
WAS NEVER LIKE, I'M GOING TO GO DO THAT UNTIL I GOT TO COLLEGE AND KIND
OF STARTED SWITCHING MAJORS A FEW TIMES. AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT,
HONESTLY, I WANT TO DO THIS." I DON'T WANT TO BE IN COLLEGE.

SO YOU HAD TO LEARN TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT?

YEAH.

TAKE INITIATIVE.

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY AFFECTED YOUR PROGRESSION
    THROUGH BUD/S?

PRETTY EASY GOING GUY. I THINK THAT HELPS A LOT OF THE HARD TIMES. YOU
JUST KIND OF GOT TO FIND THE HUMOR IN IT AND GET THROUGH IT. IT'S NOT
LIKE IF YOU DWELL ON EVERYTHING, LIKE, I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BUILD ON YOU
AND BE PRETTY HEAVY. BUT I'M JUST KIND OF ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES THROUGH
IT.

 OK. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAVE SORT OF ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED
    IN THE SEAL COMMUNITY. WHAT GOT YOU INTERESTED IN THE SEALS AND
    WHAT LED YOU DONE THIS PATH? DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY OR FRIENDS
    THAT WERE?

I DON'T REALLY KNOW. I KIND OF I THINK I LEARNED ABOUT THEM ON A YOUNG
AGE. I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY HOW. AND THEN-.

DID YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY, THAT WAS IN THE MILITARY?

UHHH UH. MY DAD WAS A SHERIFF'S OFFICER FOR LIKE 28 YEARS, AND I
PROBABLY HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT BECAUSE HE, LIKE I SAW HOW MUCH HE
HELPED OTHER PEOPLE. I KNEW THAT WAS PART OF SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO. I
WOULD LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE AND MIGHT DO SOMETHING GREATER THAN JUST
OURSELVES.

SOME IDEA OF SERVICE. AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE EXPOSED OR
GOT THE IDEA OF SEALS BUT IT REALLY BECAME URGENT TWO YEARS INTO
COLLEGE. WHAT WAS THAT SENSE OF URGENCY?

I DON'T EVEN, I THINK, IT WAS ALONG THE TIME, WHEN LIKE ALL THE BOOKS
AND MOVIES AND EVERYTHING WERE COMING OUT. AND I THINK I WATCHED LONE
SURVIVOR ONE DAY OR SOMETHING AND I DECIDED TO READ THE BOOK. AND THAT
LED ME INTO READING LIKE QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT BOOKS, KIND OF LIKE
RESEARCHING IT MORE. AND I WAS NOT REALLY A BIG READER. AND WHEN I
STARTED READING MORE AND LIKE, LEARNIN' MORE, I WAS LIKE, "WOW. I'M
ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN THIS." SO THAT'S WHAT KIND OF SPARKED IT. AS I'LL
LEARNED MORE, I JUST GOT MORE LIKE INTO IT. AND I WAS LIKE, "I WANT TO
DO THIS."

 SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN YOUR
    PARENTS PARENTING STYLES. SO LIKE WERE YOU SPANKED AS A KID?

YES.

FREE RANGE PARENTING, OR...

UH, IT WAS KINDA, I WAS SPANKED AS A KID, BUT MY MOM AND MY DAD REALLY
HAD DIFFERENT STYLES. MY MOM WAS LIKE DEFINITELY VERY STRICT GROWING UP.
AND DAD WAS MORE LIKE, LIKE GOOD BUDDY. LIKE MENTOR. LIKE ME. WE HUNTED
ALL THE TIME TOGETHER, PLAYED BASEBALL. HE COACHED A LOT.... BUT HE
NEVER, HE WAS NEVER LIKE ON MY CASE BUT AS MUCH AS A MOM.

AND THEN AS YOU GOT OLDER, WAS THERE LIKE, LOSS OF PRIVILEGES? DID THEY
TAKE AWAY YOUR VIDEO GAMES, YOUR PHONE, OR YOUR CAR? OR WAS IT LIKE,
"YOU DISAPPOINTED US"?

YES. IT WAS MORE LIKE THE DISAPPOINTMENT SPEECH. I NEVER, I DON'T REALLY
THINK I HAD THINGS TAKEN AWAY.

 AND THEN DID YOU MOVE THROUGHOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD OR YOUR TEENAGE
    YEARS?

WELL, LIKE BEING IN THE SAME AREA. WE MOVED, OF COURSE, LIKE OUR PARENTS
DIVORCED AND THEN THEY BOTH REMARRIED. AND LATER ON, THEY MOVED AND
MOVED AWAY FROM LIKE WHERE MY ORIGINAL HOUSE. BUT WE STILL- WERE IN THE
SAME COMMUNITY. I NEVER MOVED AWAY.

SO YOU WERE IN THE SAME SCHOOL?

YEAH.

 OK. SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. DID YOU DO ANY SPORTS,
    OR DO AN ACTIVITY WITH A CLOSE-KNIT COMMUNITY?

WE- I PLAY BASEBALL GROWING UP, FROM LIKE, I STARTED WHEN I WAS LIKE
FOUR. AND THEN WHEN I WAS EIGHT, WE HAD TO TRAVEL TEAM THAT I PLAYED
WITH UNTIL LIKE PRETTY MUCH HIGH SCHOOL, PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL.
AND THAT I DEFINITELY GOT THAT "TEAM"- I WAS ALWAYS USED TO BEING ON A
TEAM AND HAD A CLOSE KNIT GROUP OF GUYS THAT WERE ALWAYS THERE THAT
DEFINITELY LIKE, WAS PART OF THE REASON I WANT TO COME HERE JUST LIKE
THAT TEAM AND KNOWING YOU CAN COUNT ON THE DUDES.

YEAH.

 SO IN THE FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO BUD/S, YOU HAD THE TWO YEARS AND
    THEN THAT WAS RIGHT OUT OF HIGHSCHOOL, AND WAS THERE ONCE AND WAS
    THERE ANY TIME YOU WERE WORKING, OR. DOING A GAP YEAR, OR MISSION
    WORK?

YEAH. SO LIKE I WORKED IN THE SUMMER, BUT THEN AFTER COLLEGE, AFTER I
LEFT COLLEGE, I SPENT AT A YEAR JUST WORKING AND LIKE WORKING OUT GETTIN
READY TO DO IT HERE.

AND HOW LONG WAS THAT?

LIKE RIGHT AT A YEAR.

ONE YEAR AT HOME PREPARING TO START TRAINING. AND THAT WAS MOSTLY
PHYSICAL TRAINING? OR DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER, SORT OF MENTAL TRAINING?

NAH, IT WAS MAINLY JUST PHYSICAL TRAINING.

 OK, WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU
    HAVE ANY TATTOOS YOU GOT ON A WHIM?

I DON'T. [CHUCKLES].

[LAUGHS] OK. SO ANY. TICKETS, BIG PURCHASES?

NOT REALLY.

YOU DIDN'T SEE A CAR AND BUY IT ON THE SPOT?

NAH.

SO YOU'RE MORE ANALYTICAL IN YOUR DECISION MAKING. YOU PLAN YOUR
RESEARCH?

YEAH.

1WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING TIME OF BUD/S? THIS COULD BE LIKE
    AN EVENT, OR EVOLUTION, OR IT COULD BE LIKE "LOGS", OR "WATER".

PROBABLY THE WATER. PROBABLY WATER JUST BECAUSE, LIKE, THAT'S ONE THING-
I LIKE DEFINITELY SWAM AND STUFF GROWING UP. BUT I DIDN'T SWIM
COMPETITIVELY. I WAS NEVER LIKE... LIKE I JUST SWAM FOR FUN... AND NOT
NECESSARILY SWIMMING PORTION, BUT ESPECIALLY LIKE UNDERWATER STUFF. IT'S
JUST LIKE- I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH. SO IT WAS LIKE KIND OF
WEIRD AT FIRST.

SO THAT- WAS IT SCARY? WAS IT INTIMIDATING? WHY WAS IT SO HARD?

I GUESS JUST MY NERVES. NOT REALLY SCARY, BUT LIKE, I'M JUST NERVOUS. I
DON'T KNOW.

1OK. AND THEN WHEN YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING IN THE WATER
    AND YOU HAD THAT ANXIETY OR NERVOUSNESS ABOUT IT, WHAT GOT YOU?
    HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THAT CHALLENGE?

REALLY JUST STAND IN THE MOMENT AND JUST KIND OF ATTACKING IT AND, JUST
KINDA- ONCE IT, ONCE I START ANYTHING THAT I'M REALLY LIKE. "STRESSFUL
SITUATION." I JUST HAVE A WAY OF KIND OF LIKE GOING INTO LIKE A FOCUSED
MODE WHERE I WAS JUST LIKE ME DOING WHAT I NEED TO DO. AND IT'S NOT- I
DON'T LIKE OUTSIDERS STRESSORS KIND OF GET IN.

DID YOU HAVE- THAT SOUNDS VERY INTERNAL.

YEAH.

DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY. LIKE EVERYTHING YOU DO HERE IS LIKE EVERYBODY'S
GONE THROUGH IT WITH ME. YOU GUYS LIKE YOU'RE NEVER LIKE ALONE DO
ANYTHING HERE.

1DID YOU DO ANY PRACTICES LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL THAT
    YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THOSE CHALLENGES? SO, SOME GUYS WILL DO A
    PRAYER, MEDITATION, OR A MANTRA. SOME ATHLETES WILL, BEFORE A
    GAME, DO A PHYSICAL FORM IF YOU HAVE ANY ROUTINE.

NOT REALLY, NO. [CHUCKLES]. SO I JUST WENT IN TO EVERYTHING.

1OK. WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING TO
    BUD/S, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? AND
    GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF A DECISION THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH?
    SO, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE RUNNING OUT YOUR CLASSMATE, TO GO TO
    MEDICAL, WITH RISK OF GETTING HURT.

PROBABLY. SO I GUESS TALKING ABOUT LIKE RUNNING SOMEBODY OUT, JUST
KINDA, IT'S KIND OF LIKE I TRIED TO GIVE- IF WE WERE GOING TO RUN
SOMEBODY OUT, WE TRIED TO LIKE, FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND WE RAN ANYBODY
OUT OF WAS MORE LIKE- IT WASN'T AS, UHH.... A BUNCH OF GUYS LIKE YELL AT
PEOPLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WE NEVER WE NEVER REALLY, LIKE, TOLD THE GUY
TO GET OUT OR JUST KIND OF TRY TO BE NICE TO HIM, LIKE HIM IN LIKE DO
WHAT YOU CAN DO. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S GONE. AND IT'S LIKE IT WAS
HARD, OBVIOUSLY, CAUSE YOU'RE LIKE BASICALLY RUNNING THE GUY OUT, LIKE,
GROWN IN HIS DREAM. BUT IN THE END, THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.
AND MAYBE DOWN THE ROAD HE GETS SOME BETTER SHAPE AND COMES BACK AND
MAKES IT. BUT IF THIS PROGRAM WAS LIKE JUST UH... LIKE GET GUYS WHO
WEREN'T READY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEN IT WOULDN'T BE WHAT IT IS. I
DON'T KNOW. I GUESS THAT'S, I KIND OF DIDN'T REALLY ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION.

SO WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT THERE ARE STANDARDS? AND THAT IT'S
NOT REALLY THAT YOU'RE MAKING A JUDGMENT AND BUT THAT YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"THESE ARE THE STANDARDS, AND THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON."

YEAH. AND EVERYONE'S EXPECTED UPHOLD THEM. SO IF I WAS NOT MEETING THE
STANDARD TO HELP HIM, IT'S KIND OF COUNTERINTUITIVE, TO THE WHOLE
PROGRAM.

1WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL?

I THINK JUST LIKE NOT LETTING IT GET TO YOU, JUST TAKING IT ONE STEP AT
A TIME, LIKE I GOT ROLLED THAT WAS LIKE PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGER
SETBACKS I'VE HAD AT BUD/S, BUT WAS LIKE THE FIRST TIME I GOT ROLLED. NO
ONE LIKE YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK THROUGH IT. THIS, LIKE, YOU
JUST CAN'T, YOU CAN'T GET OVERWHELMED BY THE WHOLE PROCESS, YOU JUST GOT
TO LIVE IN A MOMENT, YOU KINDA GET DONE WHAT YOU GOT TO GET DONE AT THE
TIME.

SO DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT WHATS DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE WHO DIDN'T
MAKE IT, AND THOSE WHO DROPPED?

UMM... IT FELT LIKE THEY GOT IN THEIR OWN HEAD MOSTLY. KIND OF LIKE I
WAS SAYING, LIKE I GOT AHEAD OF THEIRSELF THINKING LIKE, WOW, THIS
SUCKS. WE GOT THIS AND I STILL GOT TO DO THIS. THEY'RE NOT- THEY WEREN'T
FOCUSED ON LIKE LIVING AT THE MOMENT. JUST GETTING THROUGH THE EVOLUTION
AT HAND.

1HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

ABSOLUTELY. I'VE DEFINITELY GROWN- FACING ADVERSITY IS LIKE THE WAY- I
FEEL LIKE ONCE YOU MAKE THROUGH THIS, YOU DON'T. NOTHING REALLY SEEMS
QUITE AS BIG OF AN ISSUE TO YOU AS IT WOULD BE LIKE BEFORE I WENT
THROUGH THIS. SO, LIKE, IF YOU GAVE ME A REALLY BIG PROBLEM, I'D BE
LIKE, I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT LIKE I THIS PROGRAM REALLY
TEACHES YOU TO USE YOUR RESOURCES, DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN AND KINDA,
LIKE, ATTACK ANY ISSUE YOU HAVE TO ATTACK.

_PROBLEM SOLVING?_

YEAH.

OK. IS THERE ANY QUESTION THAT WE HAVEN'T COVERED THAT YOU THINK WOULD
BE USEFUL FOR THIS IDEA OF INVESTIGATING WHO IS SUCCESSFUL AND WHY?

UMMM NOT REALLY.

OK. I'M GOING TO HIT STOP.

AND THEN I’LL JUST CONFIRM WITH YOU IT’S OK IF WE RECORD?

YES

GREAT AND THEN WOULD YOU UH STATE YOUR PARTICIPANT ID NUMBER?

345

OK GREAT UH SO WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUDS CLASS?

UH 334

AND UH SO YOU HOLD

YES

(UNINTELLIGIBLE) OR IS THIS THE SAME CLASS YOU STARTED IN

NO I-I STARTED WITH 334 NOW I’M IN 339

OK SO UM HAS THIS THIS BUDS EXPERIENCE BEEN YOUR ONLY BUDS EXPERIENCE?

 (SIO): UM SO CAN WE TALK ABOUT YOUR
    FAMILY? UH DO YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

I HAVE TWO OLDER SISTERS

OK SO YOU’RE THE THIRD

I’M THE YOUNGEST YES

THE YOUNGEST OF THREE OK SO, YOUR SISTER UH YOUR SISTER AND THEN ARE
YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED, YOUNG AGE I DON’T REALLY REMEMBER

NICE

AND SO GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH OF THOSE SEPARATED PARENTS AND THEN

UM

DROWNED UH THAT I DON’T KNOW THAT THAT MESSED ME UP FOR LIKE A FEW DAYS
UM BUT I HAD LIKE A LOT OF CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY KINDA REACH OUT UM

AND YOU WERE THERE IN THE POOL

YEA YUP UM

TO HAVE THE SKILLSET TO HELP IN ANY SITUATION

AND THAT WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL?

YES

UM SO AGAIN I’M SORRY THAT MUST’VE BEEN REALLY HARD

I JUST FEEL FOR THE FAMILY MORE THAN ANYTHING

 UM SO HOW HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTORED INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE
    AT BUD/S?

UM *PAUSE* (UNINTELLIGIBLE) QUESTION UM

AS OF (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

LIKE KINDA JUST LIKE LOOKING OUT FOR THE OTHER GUYS UM MAKES THINGS
EASIER UM JUST WHEN YOU’RE KINDA NOT FOCUSED ON YOURSELF, YOU DON’T
REALLY THINK ABOUT LIKE HOW MUCH PAIN YOU’RE IN UM I THINK THAT’S
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE (UNINTELLIGIBLE) CAUSE ME AND MY FRIEND UH PULLED
HIM OUT OF THE POOL AND UH LIKE AFTER THAT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME UM LIKE
CHECKING IN ON MY FRIENDS LIKE CHECKING IN ON THE FAMILY UH AND ALL THAT
AND IT KINDA LOOKING UH LOOKING AT LIKE OTHER PEOPLE’S PAIN AND LIKE
TRYING TO HELP WITH THAT IT TAKES AWAY FROM YOUR PAIN YOU’RE FEELING SO
THAT HELPED A LOT

YEA

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UM.. IT WORKED I GUESS UH

*LAUGHS*

I DON’T KNOW

SO ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH PERSONALITY TRAITS UH THINGS LIKE INTROVERSION,
EXTROVERSION

YEA

OPENNESS, AGREEABLENESS

OK

CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

UM

WHAT ARE THE TRAITS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU THAT YOU THINK

I DON’T KNOW I GUESS I’M NOT LIKE I’M NOT CRAZY OUTGOING UM BUT I’M NOT
CRAZY INTROVERTED UH...I’M NOT REALLY SURE

YOU’RE JUST KINDA A WELL ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL?

I-I’D LIKE TO THINK SO UM I DON’T KNOW, I JUST HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR
ABOUT THE STUFF WE’RE GOING THROUGH HERE AND I TRY NOT TO TAKE ALL OF IT
TOO SERIOUSLY

OK

UM I THINK THAT HELPED

 IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE
    BECOMING PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY, DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS
    FAMILY OR FRIENDS, DO YOU HAVE A MILITARY FAMILY?

UH A LITTLE BIT MY DAD WAS IN THE NAVY BUT HE GOT DRAFTED UH IN VIETNAM

OK

UM BUT I HAVE TWO COUSINS WHO’RE BROTHERS UH AND THEY WERE OFFICERS IN
THE TEAMS

OK

UH JUST GROWING UP LIKE THEY WERE THE UH THEY WERE JUST LIKE THE BIGGEST
ROLE MODELS LIKE AND EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY LOOKED UP TO THEM AND THEY
WERE JUST ALWAYS HAPPY

AND THEY WERE YOUR COUSINS YOU SAID

YEA THA-MY COUSINS, THEY WERE BROTHERS

OK

UM AND UH GOT LIKE PICTURES OF LIKE LIKE A FAMILY VACATION AND THEY’RE
JUST LIKE THROWING ME IN THE AIR INTO A POOL

OK

UM YEA THEY WERE UH YEA THEY WERE JUST UH ROLE MODELS FOR ME AND UM I-I
JUST WANTED TO KINDA BE THE TYPE OF MAN THAT THEY ARE

YEA AND HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO MENTOR YOU OR GIVE YOU..

A-A LITTLE BIT

ADVICE..

I CHECK IN WITH THEM ON UH ON MY PROGRESS IS GOING, THEY’LL YEA THEY’LL
THROW IN SOME TIDBITS OF ADVICE

 OK, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW
    WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR
    PARENTS PARENTING STYLE? (SPANKING, TIMEOUTS, WITHHOLDING TOYS,
    ETC.).

YEA UM MY PARENTS HAD DIFFERENT WAYS OF DISCIPLINING UM MY MOM SHE
YELLED UH A LITTLE BIT AND UH I DON’T KNOW I’VE PROBABLY ONLY HEARD MY
DAD RAISE HIS VOICE ONCE IN MY LIFE UH IT WAS KINDA WORSE WITH MY DAD
BECAUSE IF YOU SCREWED UP UH WASN’T MAD HE WAS JUST DISAPPOINTED

OK

AND THAT WAS WAY WORSE

YEA

UM YEA SO

ANY SPANKING (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

UM

SPOONS..

I GOT SPANKED MAYBE LIKE ONCE OR TWICE THAT’S ABOUT IT

UM TAKING AWAY TOYS OR PRIVILEGES..

YEA

TAKING AWAY A CAR..

YEA THERE WAS DEFINITELY UM YEA DEFINITELY LIKE THREATS OF LIKE TAKING
AWAY A PHONE OR CAR OR LIKE UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN’T GO DO THIS ON THE
WEEKEND OR WHATEVER, IT WASN’T ANYTHING CRAZY UM

OK DID YOU MOVE AROUND THROUGHOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD OR YOUR TEENAGE YEARS?

YEA UM I STAYED IN SO I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN SANTA BARBARA UM AND WE
ALWAYS STAYED THERE BUT WE DEFINITELY MOVED SOME HOUSES UM IT’S LIKE UM
WHEN MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED MY DAD STAYED AT THE HOUSE HE BUILT AND
THEN MY MOM MOVED UM TO ANOTHER HOUSE AND THEN MY DAD HAD TO SELL THE
HOUSE UM SO I-I’VE MOVED HOUSES A LOT

OK AND DID THAT REQUIRE YOU TO MOVE SCHOOLS OR SOCIAL GROUPS?

NO NO NOT REALLY

 OK UM TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU
    MOVE AROUND? DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A TEAM SPORT OR AN ACTIVITY
    WITH A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY? SO LIKE BAND OR THEATER?

UM UH I WAS ON SPORTS TEAMS MY WHOLE LIFE BU- SO I PLAYED WATER POLO AND
SWAM IN HIGH SCHOOL

OK

UH I WAS UH BOY SCOUTS UH FROM A SUPER YOUNG AGE TILL I WAS LIKE 17

DID YOU DO EAGLE SCOUT

YEA, YEA I GOT MY EAGLE SCOUT UM WHAT ELSE, I WAS I WAS A BEACH
LIFEGUARD FOR 6 YEARS, UM THAT WAS AWESOME LOVED THAT JOB YEA

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS PRIOR TO BUDS? SO YOU
    MENTIONED SOME COLLEGE

YEA I-I DID A YEAR IN COLORADO AT UC BOULDER UM

AND THEN WHAT?

THEN I DID A YEAR AND A HALF AT CITY COLLEGE BACK HOME, SANTA BARBARA
CITY COLLEGE, UH WHERE I WAS DOING UH JUST I GOT MY ASSOCIATES IN THE
ONLY DEGREE THAT DIDN’T REALLY REQUIRE MATH WHICH WAS COMMUNICATIONS UM
UM

SO YOU HAVE TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF CREDITS?

YES

OK AND THEN WHY NOT FINISH THE DEGREE?

UM I I DIDN’T REALLY LIKE SCHOOL AND I-FROM A YOUNG AGE I’VE ALWAYS
KNOWN THAT I WANTED TO DO THIS SO I JUST DECIDED TO SEND IT, UM DID
JIU-JITSU UM UM

EXTRA-CURRICULARS..

WORKED A LOT

WORKED..WHAT SORT OF JOBS?

UH LIFEGUARDING THE WHOLE TIME

OK, *PAUSE* WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU
HAVE ANY TATTOOS THAT YOU GOT ON A WHIM OR..

NO YEA I WOULDN’T CONSIDER MY-

SPEEDING TICKETS?

I HAVE ONE SPEEDING TICKET UM I DON’T EVER WANT TO REPEAT THAT UM

IT’S EXPENSIVE

YEA

*LAUGHS*

UM YEA NO TATTOOS I NO I-I THINK THINGS THROUGH FOR SURE

NO BIG PURCHASES UH

NOTHING ON A WHIM NO

EVERYTHING’S PREMEDITATED

PRETTY GOOD AT SAVING, INVESTING YEA NOTHING CRAZY

 OK SO REFLECTING ON BUDS, WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING
    COMPONENT OF BUD/S?

UH

THIS COULD BE A DAY, THIS COULD BE A THEME?

FOR ME IT WAS LOGS, I HATED LOGS

OK

UM

WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THEM?

THEY JUST THEY JUST SUCKED

*LAUGHS*

UM YEA LOT OF LOT OF PAIN

OK SO WHAT SO MOTIVAT..WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH IT RIGHT? SO
YOU KNEW IT WAS GONNA SUCK BEFORE YOU DID THEM

YUP

BUT YOU GOT THROUGH THEM, WHAT WAS IT THAT..?

I JUST KNEW THAT UM IF I JUST STOPPED DOING LOGS (UNINTELLIGIBLE) THAT
WOULD BE LIKE I QUIT AND I KNEW I WASN’T GOING TO QUIT UM UH SOMETHING
UH ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO WAS A TEAM GUY UH SAID TO ME BEFORE I CAME OUT
HERE, WE HAD LUNCH, UH HE’S LIKE NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT SUCKS OR HOW MUCH
IT HURTS JUST KNOW LIKE IN THE END IT’S ALL WORTH IT, SO I KINDA JUST
KEPT THAT IN MIND UM JUST KINDA DEALT WITH THE PAIN THEN AGAIN I ALSO
JUST LOOKED OUT FOR THE OTHER GUYS IN THE BOAT CREW

OK

AND THAT HELPED

SO YOU HAD SORT OF THIS INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE OF PAIN IS TEMPORARY

YUP DEFINITELY

OK AND THEN YOU HAD AN EXTERNAL THESE GUYS ARE DEPENDING ON ME

YEA YEA

UM AND THEN UH NOT WANTING TO LET THE GROUP DOWN I GUESS

BIG TIME YEA

AND THEN SO THAT’S YOU NOT WANTING TO DISAPPOINT THEM OR LET THEM DOWN,
DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THEM?

UH THIS UH A LOT OF GUYS DEFINITELY, I-I’VE BEEN UNDER A LOG OR A BOAT
WITH A LOT OF GREAT GUYS UM BUT I’VE ALSO HAD REALLY SOME TURDS

YEA

UM

SO YOU’D SAY THAT MOST OF THIS MOTIVATION REALLY CAME FROM THE INTERNAL
SOURCE

YEA I’D SAY SO

 OK DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL)THAT
    YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES? SO SOME GUYS SAY THEY
    HAVE A PRAYER OR A MANTRA OR OR A VISUALIZATION EXERCISE

YEA UH THIS WAS DURING HELL WEEK IT REALLY CAME OUT IT WAS KINDA LIKE
OUR CLASS THING UM SORRY IF I SWEAR

YEA

ALRIGHT UH IT WAS JUST I HAVE THIS VIDEO FROM OUR HELL WEEK UM ONE OF
THE INSTRUCTORS TOOK OF US JUST CRAWLING AROUND IN THE WATER ON LIKE
THURSDAY MORNING UH CHANTING “IT DOESN’T FUCKING MATTER” SO IT WAS LIKE
OUR THING WAS LIKE IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO US OR LIKE HOW MUCH
IT SUCKS, I-I’M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

YEA OK SO THIS WAS SORT OF A GROUP MANTRA

YEA A LITTLE BIT

THAT DEVELOPED….UH “IT DOESN’T FUCKING MATTER” MHM..(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

 SO WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
    WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? AND IS
    THERE A DECISION YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH? SO FOR EXAMPLE RUNNING
    CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASSMATE WERE YOU EVER
    CONFRONTED WITH LIKE A HARD CHOICE

*PAUSE* I DON’T THINK SO..I...THINK THE ONLY HARD CHOICE WOULD BE
QUITTING AND I WASN’T EVER GOING TO DO THAT

OK

UM

WHAT ABOUT LIKE EVALS (UNINTELLIGIBLE)?

UM YEA I MEAN THAT WAS NEVER FUN UM BUT I I DON’T THINK I EVER WROTE
DOWN ANYTHING I WOULDN’T SAY TO THAT PERSON’S FACE UM SO IT WASN’T
REALLY A HARD DECISION UM I DON’T KNOW MAYBE GOING TO MEDICAL WHEN I WAS
SCREWED UP CAUSE I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT GETTING ROLLED OR DROPPED UM
BUT I KNOW I COULDN’T REALLY CONTINUE...THAT SUCKED

SO WHAT HELPED YOU GO-ACTUALLY GO, YOU WENT?

YEA UM JUST UH TALKING TO THE OTHER GUYS AND UH SEEING WHAT THEY
THOUGHT, GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS UM AND UH JUST KINDA IN-THE-AND
DOING WHAT I DO AND WHAT I HAD TO DO (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING AS FAR AS YOU
    DID?

UM THINK I-I THINK I HAD A REALLY GOOD FRIEND GROUP UM A LOT OF CLOSE
FRIENDS HERE UH THEN FAMILY UH YEA FAMILY FRIENDS I JUST I KNEW IF I-I
DIDN’T GO ALL THE WAY, I’D JUST DISAPPOINT THEM AND I DIDN’T WANT TO DO
THAT

 YEA OK WHAT ABOUT THOSE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT? WHAT WAS IT IN
    THEM THAT FAILED

UM I’M NOT SURE I-I THINK THERE’S HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT REASONS LIKE
SOME OF THE FLEET RETURNEES THAT WERE GETTING OUT IN A FEW MONTHS UM
THEY HAD THAT OPTION UM I DON’T KNOW I DIDN-I DIDN’T HAVE A PLAN B TO
THIS AND THAT WAS THAT WAS VERY INTENTIONAL

OK

UM I DIDN’T WANT TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE CAUSE SOME GUYS, THERE WAS SOME
DUDE WHO HAD LIKE A MASTERS UM I DON’T KNOW UH

SOMETHING TO PURSUE

YES SOMETHING CRAZY AND HE UH HE QUIT CAUSE HE HAD A BACKUP PLAN UM HE
KNEW HE'D BE FINE IF HE DIDN’T MAKE IT UM

SO YOU’D SAY THEY WEREN’T ALL IN?

YEA

 BONUS QUESTION - OK, HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A
    PERSON?

YEA DEFINITELY

OH

YEA UH I DON’T KNOW IF IT’S MADE ME A HARDER PERSON OR A SOFTER PERSON
UM

HUH

BUT IT-I DEFINITELY DON’T REALLY LIKE THE OCEAN AS MUCH AS I USED TO UM

OK

AND I THINK UM IT'S DEFINITELY MADE ME MO-MORE CONFIDENT IN I GUESS MY
ABILITIES JUST YOU KNOW AND I CAN GO THROUGH A LOT OF..SHIT

OK

COME OUT THE OTHER END OK

CONFIDENCE OK IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I HAVEN’T ASKED ABOUT THAT YOU
THINK IS RELATIVE TO THIS DISCUSSION OF UM.. MENTAL GRIT, HEARTINESS,
RESILIENCE, MINDFULNESS…

NO I-I DON’T THINK SO (UNINTELLIGIBLE)

OK SO I’LL HIT STOP...STOP

OKAY, SO I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT OPEN ENDED, BUT
SOMEWHAT CLOSED, SO IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY TO ANSWER THEM. UH, WE GOT
ABOUT 15 MINUTES, SO UH

OKAY

...HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

YA

UH, SO WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S?

2008

2008?

YES, ...I… MY FIRST ATTEMPT.

UH, SO THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST?

NO THIS IS MY SECOND TIME THROUGH.

WHEN DID YOU START THIS ATTEMPT?

THIS ONE WAS IN FEBRUARY, SORRY UH, AUGUST OF 2018

AUGUST OF 2018?

UH, 2019.

OH, 2019? SO DID YOU START WITH 339?

UH, 338.

 (SIO): OKAY, UHM, HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO
    YOU HAVE?

I HAVE A SISTER.

A SISTER? YOUNGER OR OLDER?

YOUNGER

WHAT WAS YOUR PARENTAL SITUATION GROWING UP?

UHM, MOTHER, A BIOLOGICAL MOTHER AND THEN A ,UH, STEPFATHER WHO ADOPTED
US.

SO WERE YOUR PARENTS, YOUR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS, MARRIED? DIVORCED?

NO

NO?

NO THEY, UH, THEY NEVER WEDDED.

WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP, SO DO YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH YOUR
MOTHER AND BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

YES, I DIDN’T MEET MY BIOLOGICAL FATHER UNTIL I WAS 25.

HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR MOM?

GREAT

LET ME GO BACK TO THIS FIRST QUESTION. SO YOU STARTED YOUR FIRST BUD/S
CLASS WAS 2008 AND THIS IS YOUR SECOND? OR HAVE YOU DONE...HAD OTHER

TECHNICALLY WOULD 338 AND 339 BE TWO SEPARATE ONES?

I DON’T KNOW. SO, BUT BETWEEN SO IN 2008?

I QUIT.

YOU QUIT?

YES

AND THEN NOT AGAIN UNTIL LAST YEAR?

YES

SO YOU’RE ONE OF THE OLDER?

I AM.

THAT’S GOT TO MAKE IT TOUGHER?

IT DID

PHYSICALLY?

AND MENTALLY AS WELL (CHUCKLES).

 SO WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO
    BUD/S?

SO, PRIOR TO THIS TIME, I GUESS, INBETWEEN, OR MORE BEFORE THE FIRST
ONE?

UHM, EITHER UH, EITHER WAY I GUESS.

UHM, NOTHING SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS WHY I DIDN’T HAVE
ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND I QUIT, AND THEN INBETWEEN 2008 AND 2000...NOW,
WENT TO THE FLEET AND DID ABOUT 9 YEARS.

AND THAT JUST MADE YOU DECIDE YOU WANTED TO…

I KNEW I WANTED TO COME BACK, AND, UH, UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A LONG ROAD
SO I GUESS THAT IN ITS… TRYING TO GET HERE OVER A DECADE THAT WAS A
MAJOR OBSTACLE.

 SO, HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO, OR THAT EXPERIENCE
    FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE NOW?

UHM, MADE IT INFINITELY EASIER. AT LEAST ON THE MENTAL SIDE OF IT.
PHYSICALLY THE TIME, YOU KNOW, IT’S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.

YEAH, I THINK , I COULD, I COULD HAVE DONE THIS WHEN I WAS TWENTY I
DON’T KNOW, NO WAY I COULD DO IT AT MY AGE NOW. OR MAYBE NOT EVEN AT 25.

YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU COULD TALK TO A NAVY RECRUITER.

OH, I’M FORMER ARMY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, BY THE WAY.

THANK YOU FOR YOURS. I UH, IF I HAD KNOWN ALL THE THINGS ABOUT THE NAVY
I KNOW NOW, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE JOINED THE NAVY. A LOT MORE EXCITING.

 UHM, HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

I’M A HARD WORKER AND I AM A TEAM PLAYER. AND I DO, I DO, I AM MORE ON
THE INTROVERTED SIDE BUT... I THINK THAT ALLOWED ME TO NOT NECESSARILY,
MAYBE UH, NOT NEED AS MUCH EXTERNAL VALIDATION AS I DID WHEN I WAS
YOUNGER.

 SO, DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING
    PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY AND SO WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO IT, AND
    SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THEY HAVE HERE ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS
    FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR DO YOU HAVE ANY MILITARY FAMILY OR FRIENDS?

HMM, MY FATHER WAS BRITISH SAS.

BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

STEPFATHER

STEPFATHER?

YEAH...AND UH THAT INTROVERTED SIDE OF ME HAS ALWAYS, I’VE ALWAYS LONGED
FOR A COMMUNITY.

ARE YOU ENLISTED OR OFFICER?

I’M ENLISTED

ENLISTED.

 SO, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. SO WERE YOU,
    SPECIFICALLY, HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? LIKE SPANKING,
    GROUNDING?

YES, PHYSICALLY.

PHYSICALLY?

YES...I’M GLAD I WAS.

I AM TOO. OF COURSE NOT AT THE TIME THOUGHT.

OH OF COURSE, ABSOLUTELY

WERE YOU ANYTHING ELSE, LIKE TIMEOUTS OR THINGS TAKEN AWAY?

YES, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING...EVERYWAY UNDER THE SUN. THEY DID A GOOD JOB
OF IT.

 DID YOU MOVE A LOT?UHM DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD OR TEEN YEARS?

I WOULD SAY YES, MAINLY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE ONE OR TWO PLACES, BUT
I HAVE LIKE FIVE OR SIX.

LIKE IN THE SAME AREA OR A SERIES?

I WOULD SAY THE SAME AREA, LIKE CITIES BORDERING THE SAME CITY.

SO IT WASN’T LIKE MOVING FROM JAPAN TO GERMANY TO MEXICO TO CANADA TO…

NO, NO YEAH IT WAS YEAH IT WAS THE RELATIVE SAME PLACE YOU SLEEP.

SO WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER, DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN TEAM SPORTS OR
    OTHER ACTIVITIES.

I DID, I DID. UH SOCCER...FOOTBALL...BASEBALL...THEN I DID SOME
INDIVIDUAL, OH WATERPOLO AS WELL FOR TEAM. AND THEN I DID SWIMMING

ANY OTHER KIND OF TEAM ACTIVITIES?

NO

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO COMING TO
    BUD/S? YOU’VE BEEN OUT IN THE FLEET?

YEAH, I WAS IN THE CIVILIAN SECTOR FOR A LITTLE BIT OF IT AS WELL, BREAK
IN SERVICE.

I’M SORRY...OH A BREAK IN SERVICE?

YEAH, I HAD A TWO YEAR BREAK IN SERVICE.

SO, DID YOU SO YOU WERE IN THE NAVY YOU HAD A BREAK IN SERVICE AND THEN
DID YOU COME BACK IN SPECIFICALLY TO DO THIS?

YES

SO YOU’VE BEEN BACK IN FOR LIKE A YEAR

YEAH THIS THIS ACTIVE DUTY TIME HERE, YES

WHAT DID UHM, WHAT DID YOU DO DURING YOUR BREAK IN SERVICE?

I WENT TO SCHOOL FULL TIME AND I DID A MULTITUDE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE
JOBS INCLUDING PERSONAL TRAINING.

DID YOU FINISH YOUR DEGREE?

I DID NOT, NO

WHAT WERE YOU WORKING ON?

UHM A BACHELORS IN KINESIOLOGY.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

NO...NOT ANYMORE. I WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

I DO NOT, I DO NOT.

THAT’S SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF IMPULSIVITY. I THINK MAYBE
HISTORICALLY, MAYBE IT WAS.

I CAN SEE WHY.

YEAH I JUST I DON’T, I DON’T THINK OF IT THAT WAY NOW.

RIGHT YEAH

IT’S MORE OF A EVERYBODY DOES IT SEEMINGLY.

YEAH

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? HARDEST DAY,
    HARDEST EVENT?

DOES IT HAVE TO BE A SPECIFIC EVENT OR A DAY OR CAN IT BE JUST LIKE A
THEME.

IT CAN JUST BE IN GENERAL.

UHM, THE HARDEST PART WAS BEING, HAVING TO REALIZE BEING WHO YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE...YOU’RE NOT. YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ALL THE TIME ON THAT SO
HAVING TO KIND OF SELF REFLECT, YOU KNOW, REALIZE YOUR SHORT COMINGS AND
GROW FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES ARE WHAT MAKES YOU.

SO WOULD YOU SAY LIKE THAT YOU’RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED AT EVERYTHING?

ABSOLUTELY.

AND I THINK THAT’S WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING, I THINK.

YES, YEAH.

RECOGNIZING YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL.

YEAH AND IN WAYS YOU DON’T EXPECT, I MEAN YOU CAN ANTICIPATE I MEAN FOR
ME, 10 YEARS, I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I
EXPECTED SOME FAILURES AND THOSE DIDN’T BOTHER ME BUT I DIDN’T EXPECT
THE FAILURES DURING THE LESS DIFFICULT PARTS OF BUD/S.

 WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH?

DESPERATION. I DESPERATELY WANTED TO BE HERE, I WAS GOING TO DO ANYTHING
IT TOOK TO STAY

DID YOU FEEL THAT YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

YES, UP UNTIL THE LAST MONTH, YEAH.

 WHAT PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL) DID YOU UTILIZE TO
    PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

I HAD A VERY GOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM.

BUT NOT LIKE, UHH, PRAYER OR MEDITATION OR ANYTHING?

NO, I WOULD… I’M (UNINTELLIGIBLE) I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I, I’M, I
BELIEVE A MAN IF YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD PERSON YOU HAVE TO BE A MAN OF
YOUR WORD. IF YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT YOU STICK TO IT. SO I GUESS IN A WAY
THAT WAS MY SPIRITUAL THING THE WAY I PERCEIVED IT.

 SO, WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING, WHAT
    WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? IS THERE A
    SPECIFIC DECISION YOU STRUGGLED WITH AT BUD/S AND THE EXAMPLES
    THEY GIVE ARE, THEY’RE LISTED HERE, ARE YOU KNOW DECIDING TO RUN A
    CLASSMATE OUT, OR TURN IN SOMEONE WHO’S CHEATING

YEAH, SO MORE APPLICABLE TO THE LATTER, UHM, CALLING PEOPLE OUT FOR NOT
CONTRIBUTING, I WOULD SAY THAT MY FATHER ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT BAD THINGS
HAPPEN WHEN GOOD MEN STAND BY AND DO NOTHING. SO I GUESS, ALWAYS BEING
HONEST UHM, EVEN, EVEN WHEN UM I MAY WANT TO GO ALONG WITH IT UHM, DOING
THE RIGHT THING WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING, DOING THE RIGHT THING EVEN…

EVEN WHEN WHAT?

EVEN WHEN IT MIGHT BE THE MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE, UNDERSTANDING IT WAS FOR
THE BETTER.

 IS THERE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF TURNING SOMEONE IN? IS THAT
    YOU WANT TO SHARE, OR?

JUST NOT BEING AFRAID CALL YOUR, YOUR BROTHERS OUT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE
ALL ON THE SAME STANDARD AS EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT’S A DIFFICULT ONE TO
SURMISE.

HUH?

THAT’S A DIFFICULT ONE TO SURMISE ON PAPER.

OH, I’M SURE.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

UHM, ‘CAUSE I ALWAYS FOLLOW THROUGH WITH MY COMMITMENTS.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DID NOT
    MAKE IT? SOMETHING DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE FOLKS THAT WERE GOING TO
    MAKE IT AND THOSE THAT DIDN’T?

NO.

NO?

NO.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON? IF IT DID

I AM LESS CONFIDENT THAN I WAS BEFORE

LESS CONFIDENT?

YEAH...THAT’S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING.

(CHUCKLES) NO.

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I, THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU? THAT HELPED
YOU OR HURT YOU OR THAT I DIDN’T ASK YOU.

NO

WELL THAT’S IT

AWESOME, THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, AND UHM...

OK, SO I AM GOING TO ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS. WE GOT 15 MINUTES TO
GET THROUGH, SO, UMM, SO IT SHOULDN’T BE TOO TERRIBLY LONG. UMM, WHEN
DID YOU START YOUR BUDS CLASS?

STARTED 37, THAT WAS

WHAT?

CLASS 337

OK,

UHH, THAT WAS LAST YEAR IN, FEBRUARY… LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS.

FEBRUARY OF 2019?

SO THIS, THIS IS, THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST, UHH, OIR IS IT YOUR FIRST BUDS
EXPERIENCE?

UHH, YEAH, IT IS MY FIRST BUDS EXPERIENCE. I GOT ROLLED TWICE. UMM, NOW
I AM IN 339.

 (SIO): OKAY, UHM, HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO
    YOU HAVE?

I HAVE 1 YOUNGER BROTHER.

SO, IT’S YOU AND A BROTHER?

YES

WHAT WAS YOUR PARENTAL SITUATION GROWING UP?

UHH, MY MOM AND MY DAD GOT DIVORCED, UHH, AROUND, WHEN I WAS LIKE 5
YEARS OLD. THEY GOT DIVORCED, AND PRETTY MUCH, AFTER THAT, I GREW UP
JUST WITH MY MOM. AND MY DAD USED TO LIKE TRAVEL ALOT. HE WASN’T VERY
PRESENT AS PHYSICAL, BUT HE WAS LIKE - LIKE CALLED A LOT

SO HE CALLED REGULARLY?

YES

WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH BOTH OF THEM?

UHH, MY MOM WAS VERY CLOSE, SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH LIKE MY MOM AND MY DAD
AT THE SAME TIME SINCE MY DAD WASN’T THERE THAT MUCH. BUT WITH MY DAD,
IT WASN’T AS CLOSE AS WITH MY MOM, BUT IT WAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

 SO WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO
    BUD/S?

I’D SAY MY MOM AND DAD GETTING DIVORCED WOULD BE ONE. UMM, I DON’T KNOW.
I AM HAVING TO THINK ABOUT IT. UHH, I MEAN, I DIDN’T GROW UP HERE IN THE
US. I GREW UP IN COLUMBIA. SO, I -GROWING UP I GOT TO SEE US AND
COLUMBIA BOTH BECAUSE I’D TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH. SO I THINK THAT

 SO, HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO, OR THAT EXPERIENCE
    FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE NOW?

I THINK LIKE IN THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT YOU MEET. YOU GET TO APPRECIATE
THE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE. LIKE, EVERYBODY’S DIFFERENT AND JUST BECAUSE
THEIR DIFFERENT DOESN’T MEAN, I DON’T KNOW, JUST … I’LL SAY YOU JUST GET
TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

 UHM, HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UHH, I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF A VERY QUIET PERSON. I THINK THAT THAT
HELPS A LOT HERE BECAUSE SOMETIMES LEADERSHIP IS TRYING TO PUT OUT WORD
AND THEIR ARE OTHER PEOPLE TALKING AND SAYING STUFF AND IT IS JUST SOUND
POLLUTION. SO, I THINK THAT THAT HELPED A LOT. ALSO, I AM A VERY PERSON
- I LISTEN A LOT. THERE IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL HERE,
SO I GUESS THAT HELPS A LOT TOO.

 SO, DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING
    PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY AND SO WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO DO IT, AND
    SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THEY HAVE HERE ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS
    FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR DO YOU HAVE ANY MILITARY FAMILY OR FRIENDS?

YEAH, SO PRIOR NAVY, I DID NOT KNOW ANY NAVY SEALS AND THE WAY I GOT
LIKE LEARN ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY WAS PRETTY MUCH, SO I WAS BORN HERE IN
SAN DIEGO OR YOU SEE LITTLE CAMP DOWN BY THE STRAND BY THOSE MOTOR HOMES
DOWN THERE. I USED TO SEE THE BUDS CLASSES DOWN THE BEACH AND THAT
REALLY GOT ME INTERESTED. SO, I GREW UP AND STARTED LEARNING MORE AND
DECIDED THATS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I DIDN’T WANT TO DO THE SAME THINGS MY
FRIENDS WERE DOING, LIKE FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND GO TO COLLEGE. YOU KNOW
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

 SO, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. SO WERE YOU,
    SPECIFICALLY, HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? LIKE SPANKING,
    GROUNDING?

UHH, I MEAN MY MOM WAS GREAT. SHE WAS LIKE, SHE WAS DEFINITELY VERY
STRICT, BUT SHE WAS ALSO VERY NICE AND KIND AND

DID YOU GET SPANKED?

UHH, EARLY

EARY?

I HARDLY REMEMBER A TIME I GOT SPANKED

SO YOU GOT GROUNDED? TIMEOUTS? THINGS TAKEN AWAY?

UMM, YEAH SHE WAS LIKE, LIKE - I LIKE A LOT OF SPORTS, SO IF I GOT A BAD
GRADE, SHE MIGHT TAKE SPORTS AWAY FROM ME. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

 DID YOU MOVE A LOT?UHM DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD OR TEEN YEARS?

UMM, YES, PRETTY MUCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE STATES AND COLUMBIA.

SO THIS AREA? SAN DIEGO AND COLUMBIA?

SAN DIEGO, YES. SO I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE, BUT I SPENT ALL OF MY
VACATIONS HERE. SUMMER, CHRISTMAS, ALL SPENT HERE.

SO WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER, DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN TEAM SPORTS OR
    OTHER ACTIVITIES.

UHH, YES, I PLAYED FOR MY SOCCER TEAM, MY VOLLEYBALL TEAM, AND MY
BASKETBALL TEAM IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND, I WAS INTO BOXING AND MARTIAL ARTS.

SO MARTIAL ARTS?

OH, YEAH

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO COMING TO
    BUD/S?

HIGH SCHOOL PRETTY MUCH. I FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND CAME HERE.

SO YOU WENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO ENLISTED IN THE NAVY AND CAME

YES AND CAME HERE TO BUDS. I FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL IN 2018. 2018, I CAME
HERE TO SAN DIEGO AND PROBABLY LASTED LIKE TWO MONTHS WORKING OUT AND
THEN JOINED THE NAVY AND CAME HERE TO BUDS

DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

I WOULD NOT CONSIDER MYSELF IMPULSIVE.

THE EXAMPLE IN THE QUESTION THEY ASK IS DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

I DO.

IS THAT IT?

THAT’S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE.

I THINK THERE IS SOME LITERATURE THAT SUGGEST THAT HAVING TATTOOS IS A
SIGN OF IMPULSIVITY. PROBABLY DATED, BUT UHH,

I’D LIKE TO READ THAT

MEHH

 WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
    QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S)

UHH, I WOULDN’T SAY ITS A DAY. ITS LIKE A WEEK. I WOULD SAY IT WOULD
DEFINITELY BE FIRST PHASE. ITS JUST LIKE YOU’RE SUPER TIRED, YOU’RE
HURT, YEAH, YOU’RE DRAINED, BUT YOU … AND YOU HAVE THESE TEST LIKE
PHYSICAL EVOLUTIONS LIKE RUNS AND SWIMS. YOU START THINKING YOU MIGHT
NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AND YOUR LIKE SCARED ABOUT GETTING PERFORMANCED
DROPPED. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE HURT AND INJURED. HAVING TO DO THOSE
THINGS WHILE YOU’RE HURT AND INJURED, I MEAN, YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
PERFORM.

 WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH? DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE
    SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

UHH, I THINK LIKE ALL THE TRAINING AND LIKE ME LEAVING COLUMBIA AND
COMING HERE BECAUSE I KNEW I WANTED TO DO THIS, I WAS JUST NOT GOING TO
LET THAT BE FOR NOTHING. YEAH, I WAS JUST NOT GOING TO LET ME FAMILY
DOWN AND MYSELF DOWN. AND I WAS ALREADY HERE SO, I WAS LIKE THIS IS MY
ONLY OPTION SO

 WHAT PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL) DID YOU UTILIZE TO
    PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

UHH, SELF TALK, YOU SEE YOU HAVE THAT VOICE IN MY HEAD THAT WOULD TELL
ME THAT I HAVE LIKE A LITTLE MORE. I WOULD HAVE THINGS IN MY HEAD THAT
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL HAPPY. I WOULD THINK A LOT ABOUT MY BROTHER AND MY
MOM. YEAH, THATS IT

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT BUD/S,
    WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION?

WHAT DECISION DID YOU REALLY STRUGGLE WITH?

HMM,

THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY GIVE HERE IS TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASSMATE FOR
EXAMPLE.

OK, YEAH SOMETHING IN HELL WEEK. WE WERE RUNNING BOAT AND ONE GUY WAS
DEFINITELY NOT PERFORMING. HE WAS NOT KEEPING UP WITH US AND IT WAS
EITHER WE SLOW DOWN AND HAVE IN IN OUR BOAT AND NOT PERFORM OR
PERFORMING AND EVENTUALLY KNOWING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP
WITH US AND THAT HE WOULD GET DROPPED. HE DEFINITELY WASN’T ONE OF THE
GOOD GUYS IN OUR CLASS, SO WE DECIDED AS A CREW THAT WE WERE GOING TO
RUN HIM OUT. SO WE JUST SPED UP AND HE EVENTUALLY ENDED UP FALLING OUT.
I’D SAY THAT WAS A HARD DECISION.

SO WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU MADE THAT DECISION?

UHH, I WAS THINKING LIKE WAS IT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE SLOWED DOWN AND LET HIM KEEP THE PACE OR WAS HIM PERFORMING A GOOD
THING TO DO BY MAKING US NOT PERFORM.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

I THINK A LOT HAS TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET HERE AND THE
RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU MAKE. THEY DEFINITELY HELP A LOT. AND LIKE I SAID
BEFORE, I FELT LIKE I LEFT BEHIND ME LIKE A LOT OF STUFF TO COME HERE
AND I WAS NOT GOING TO LET THAT BE FOR NOTHING.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE
    IT? IF SO, CAN YOU DESCRIBE THOSE DIFFERENCES?

YES, THEY WERE VERY, LIKE BEFORE COMING HERE, WHEN WE WERE AT GREAT
LAKES, THEY WERE VERY COCKY, TALK A LOT, OR BE LIKE OH YEAH, I AM AN
AMAZING GUY. YEAH, THEY WERE PRETTY COCKY, NO HUMILITY. UHH, IMMATURE.
YEAH, I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO BIG THINGS I NOTICED, COCKY AND
IMMATURE.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON?

UHH, IT DEFINITELY SHOWED ME THAT YOU CAN DEFINITELY LIKE YOU AND YOUR
MIND CAN JUST DO A LOT OF THINGS. YOU MIGHT NOT BE THE FASTEST OR
STRONGEST DUDE, BUT IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN DO IT, YOU CAN.

UHH IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU THAT HELPED YOU
OR HURT YOU THROUGH BUDS?

UH, I THINK THAT IS IT.

OK, WE’RE DONE.

This is participant number 351. So I’ve just got a series of questions
and... we should be able to get through all of them - we’ve got 15
minutes, um ya know give or take a minute or so. Um when did you start
BUD/S?

Uh, I want to say June last year, uh June July area. Came in February.

Is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yep, yes.

How many siblings do you have?

One younger sister.

What is your uh, what was your parental situation growing up?

Uh my parental situation? Um, my parents were together until I was about
17 years old and then divorced. Um...Very civil. There was no uh big
situation, not even child support or anything. Just parted ways.

So it was amicable?

Yes.

What’s your relationship like with your mom and dad?

Uh..like, like I said - very civil. I visit both of them regularly.
They’ll be around each other regularly. So, it’s - they’re very good.
Very, um, probably consider my relationship with my dad a little more
like a buddy, but very respectable, at least I’d say normal.

What life-changing events um happened in your life prior to BUD/S?

Um.. yeah, nothing crazy. Especially involving me coming to BUD/S. No,
nothing.

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression
through BUD/S?

I’d say uh well I’ve always kindof considered myself a little bit of an
agreeable person, so.

A what?

An Agreeable - person.

Agreeable?

Yeah, uh. I definitely uh. That kind of makes it really easy to get
along with a lot of people. When you have a bunch of different
personalities and you’re. But um, I’d say that’s been in my favor. No
authority issues, have an easy time following orders. Take charge when I
need to.

So, describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL community and in particular, the question is, do you have any SEALs
as family or friends, do you have any military family or friends in
general?

Okay Umm. I do have military family. Not immediate family, uh, my
grand-dad was in the Marines, but that’s, that’s about it. No close
relatives. No military. Uh, prior to going to BUD/S I did landscaping
growing up and construction, and uh I found out that I didn’t really
find, see myself pursuing anything like that. Looked around, didn’t know
the military was an option, uh really, didn’t consider it until later.
And uh, jumped on that pretty quick. Found out about the BUD/S pipeline,
SEAL teams. Jumped on that about as fast as I could.

And how did you hear about their, how’d you find out about the SEALS?

Um I guess, movies. I mean they’re pretty popular. It’s kinda, it’s
kinda easy to pick up the name. Um I went to talk to the recruiter - I
was originally going to go Marines. But, the recruiter. I accidentally
walked into a Navy command. He told me about the SEAL teams and
everything. So, I liked the idea of that a lot more than the Marines.

So tell me a little bit about your uh childhood - so, in particular, how
were you disciplined as a child? Were you spanked? Were you grounded?

Not nearly as much as I probably should have been. Um, yeah, I was - I
was spanked. My dad had the sound of him opening his closet with the
belt hanging. It always kinda, make a noise. The whip of the belt coming
out. But probably didn’t get my butt beat nearly as much as I should
have.

Did you move around uh as a child? Teenager?

No, no.

Did you in high school participate in team sports?

Uh, no, I played as a young kid - I got into music when I got in high
school and I had to start working. So, no.

So, you did music in high school?

Yeah, yeah I didn’t play in the school band or anything. I got in a
garage band with a bunch of my buddies. I played guitar since I was
younger. But that was sort of where a lot of my interest went.

And then you started working?

Yeah, yessir - I worked since I was a little kid. Um I did landscaping
with my dad; worked at the grocery store; went and did construction.

Framing?

Uh, it was more demolition. So I started with demolition and then I
would help rebuild the house too.

So destruction?

Say again.

Destruction?

It was, it was a big mixture. So it was disaster restoration. We’d come
in and mow the house out, and then rebuild it. So we did some framing,
um I helped a lot with drywall, a lot of interior work.

So what have you done in the last five years before coming to BUD/S?

Uh construction area.

So did you, did you graduate high school and go?

Uh, yes. I graduated high school in 2014. And then I tried college,
wasn’t much for it - couldn’t really find an interest of my own. I do
plan on going. Um, yeah that was about it, working, gave the college
route a shot, find my way in there.

So you, some college, you’re working, you joined the Navy?

Yes.

How long have you been in the Navy?

One year this year.

So you joined the Navy specifically to come to BUD/S?

Yeah, bootcamp straight to here.

Would you consider yourself impulsive?

...No.

We’ll be measuring the delay it takes for people to answer that
question.

Okay, sorry.

No, I’m saying - the irony would be, if you took a long time to say yes.

Okay, right.

Do you have any tattoos?

No.

That’s an example of impulsivity, apparently.

Okay.

So, what was the most challenging component in BUD/S? Uh Either in a day
or an event.

Um, well one of the biggest things that was a shock to me was like the
kind of people here. Not even so much an event, but really just trying
to keep with these guys. Like, like I said, I didn’t play sports in high
school. So I might have been a little bit on the lesser spectrum of
godly athlete. But um, trying to keep up with them was fairly difficult.
And the mind and physical. Yeah, you got the hard chargers. That
definitely. Super professional, everyone shows up on time. That wasn’t
something I was used to. But um, yeah. I was going to say a specific
evolution, but can’t think of anything else.

So what motivated you to push through?

Um same thing, um you kind of look around while you’re getting cold and
wet, and running with that boat on your head. You look around and kinda
see everyone else suffering too, it takes you out of your own head
kinda.

Did you feel like group support was important?

For sure.

So what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, did you use to push
through?

Well I don’t know if you know about our Masterchief Magorachi, with his
stuff, the visualization, and the um, that was probably a big thing when
it came to doing stuff like OC8. Kinda going and getting the mental reps
in your head before you go something definitely helped a lot, that for
sure a big thing. Um, following the breathing they gave us. Really
everything he briefed us on - I don’t know if you’re familiar with it.
It’s very uh, it’s - I definitely encourage it.

What is it in particular? I mean, what kind of..

So, he gives these - it’s based off of say uh three of four little
principles - visualization, arousal control, um it just involves
controlling your breathing, how excited you’re getting, stuff like that.
To be honest, I can’t bring up in my head right now. But, he kind of
precedes all of BUD/S with this big brief; he talks about everything,
it’s pretty interesting. Just stuff along that matter, I can’t remember
the rest of the acronym. I’d say the visualization and everything.

What’s the, what is the acronym?

V-A-G-S. Vags. But it’s, it’s very good stuff - very intelligent.

So when you made a difficult decision during BUD/S, what went through
your mind as you made the decision? So what decision did you really
struggle with and in particular, the examples that are listed here are:
running classmates out or turning in someone who’s cheating, anything
like that.

Well, you absolutely don’t want to do that. But at the same time, you
don’t want to do that at the beginning. Now, you’re looking around the
room and like realizing you’re going to work with these guys, I realized
that kind of early on, run out of boat in BUD/S, unfortunately now you
got out. Um, I don’t know if that answers the question much, but.

Well, so I guess the question is really about - did you have to make
such a decision, and when you made that decision what went through your
mind?

Uh, yes. Just we all signed up for it. It’s part of the process. Um,
they used to say, ya know not everyone is a good team guy, some people
are just good neighbors.

Good what?

Good neighbors. They’re better neighbors than they are team guys. That’s
kind of what I always thought about - if you’re meant to make it through
the program, you’ll find a way through it.

Do you have a specific example?

Uh, being underneath the boat is a pretty good example. Um again, I
don’t, I don’t know what’s your extent of knowledge is on what we’re
doing, but in first phase we run with the boat on our head, and that’s
when you run people out, because if you fall out then that’s technically
a DOR or a quit. So yeah, multiple times it stinks, because everyone is
passionate about it.

So, that’s when the boat is upside down on your head and you’re?

The inflatable boat. There’s seven of us in a boat crew. And uh, you’re
running to and from whatever evolution or for the evolution you’re
running with the boat on your head. And if you don’t keep up with your
classmates, then you get exhausted and fall out, or they pull you out,
just depending. Um, yeah I mean I’m not going to stop to let him catch
up - that makes the rest of the boat get dropped. I’m trying to say that
without sounding extremely arrogant. But, no no you don’t want them to
see everybody stopping.

Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?

I would say um… definitely the mental game. Um a lot of time, we really
think, think things suck, but you take a look around and see everyone
else succeeding. Definitely helps. Same thing as earlier. It’s a group
mentality. That would probably be my biggest one. Like I said, I did do
construction and landscaping, that was good, fun, tough work - probably
made me a little bit more used to the grind if...

Did you notice anything different about the people who didn’t make it?
Any specific characteristics?

A lot less confidence in themselves. Um, yeah, yeah for sure. They uh -
we always kind of joked around that you could see it on people, but um
it’s really hard to call someone on whether they’re going to make it,
because they may surprise you. Um, but yeah, confidence was a big thing.
Especially when you’re about to quit. Um, nothing else.

How did this experience change you as a person, if it did?

Definitely more mature, and definitely know a lot more about myself. I
look for kind of professional little traits that I didn’t look at
before. Maybe a little bit more judgemental - the standards are a little
bit different here than other places. But, definitely my confidence is
through the roof now.

Is there anything else that uh, I should have asked you that I didn’t,
or that helped or hurt you in BUD/S?

I just hope they keep it the way it should be, the standards shouldn’t
be lowered. It should stay the way it is, if not keep getting harder.
Alright so I'm here with uh partici… participant number 352. Time is
0732 on 10 Feb. This is Commander Ledford. And uh we are doing the
interview. Do you consent to be interviewed?

I do

Alright awesome. So some warmup questions just to kind of get you
started. Uh how many siblings do you have?

Three.

All younger?

Yes

So, what are there ages?

Uh one of them is 22,

Uh male or female?

Male. 22 year old brother.

Ok.

19 year old brother. So male 19, and then female 16.

Uh what were your male brothers?

Oh 19.

19.

Yes.

Nice. and your age is?

24 so I’m the oldest.

And then uh your parental situation growing up. Are your parents
married or divorced?

They are still married now.

All the siblings?

Same parents yeah.

I got your birth order and siblings uh and how was your relationship
with your parents?

Very good like extremely strong relationship with both parents, still
today.

Strong. So prior to BUD/S uh what life changing events do feel like if
you were looking at the span of your life what events were like some
major ones that probably shaped you in some way?

Well growing up I played a lot of baseball you know I always wanted to
be a big baseball player but uh I had shoulder surgery in highschool
uh and uh after that another like finger surgery uh it kinda limited
my physical ability so I had to learn how to commission it back like
playing with a hurt shoulder when I wasnt supposed to.

When did that happen, the shoulder surgery?

It was uh Junior to Senior summer in Highschool. That was like the big
recruiting season so like once that happened I kind of realized that
baseball might not be my thing and I had been thinking about this for
a long time and that kind of i guess directed me this way I think
thats one of the bigger ones like huge life changing events I cant
really think of any bigger ones.

So pushing through that injury?

I mean that that was one thing that really taught me to play through
pain i guess.

Yep

And I guess it showed me I could do a lot more than I thought before i
guess.

And how did that kind of factor into your experience at BUD/S? Like uh

Uh I learned how to push through pain I was told not to play baseball
for a year but I was very stubborn and I started playing within three
months after having surgery so I learned what I was capable of I dont
know more than I previously thought as a teenager that kind of deal.
So

Sweet. What do you think about your personality that contributes
towards your sucsess at buds?

I guess I kind of have like a very serious personality um I found more
serious than a lot of the guys in the class honestly very disciplined
and focused um so I was able to latch onto the goal for a long time
without really having much else to distract me i guess thats probably
a trait that helped me I suppose.

So uh going back to your background did you have any seal friends or
family? Do you have a military family?

My dad just got out of the navy he was a surface warfare officer for
thirty years. So uh he always i guess kind of inspired me to do the
whole military thing even though he didnt push me towards it at all
and then just kind of by chance I read a book that interested me about
seals and I guess directed me this way so

So going into a little bit about your childhood uh how were
disciplined were you like did your parents put you in timeout did they
spank you uh

Iguess

Withholding toys?

It was pretty standard like timeouts they never spanked me at all uh
when I was a teenager standard groundings like no phone no going out
with friends for a week pretty standard nothing too profound I dont
think they were very uh they were very quick iguess to lay down the
hammer with regards to i guess mild discipline like I couldnt really
get away with a whole lot which I guess was pretty good in the long
run so kept me on a straightened arrow

Did you move around a lot or all the time?

I moved eighteen times before I moved out of the house so i think at
least once or twice a year so it came in waves so

So about your teenage years what about uh your participation with uh
team sports were you in any tightknit communities

Just baseball yeah I was always playing baseball year round down near
southerncalifornia so always on some kind of team and it was just
strictly baseball since it was all I cared about at the time so

And then in the last five years before you came to buds, what were you
doing in those five years before you came to buds?

So I played college baseball at a small community college for a couple
years and actually I came to buds with class 321 and dored out of that
class and spent a couple years in the fleet.

So first you went small community college

Small community college and played baseball

So you did that for two years?

Yes two years uh then I at that point I enlisted with class 321

Class 321

Dored out of that class and I was a bostwains mate in the fleet so
just a lot of painting and then I came back

How long did you spend in the fleet?

About two and a half years pretty short compared to a lot of guys but

Would you consider yourself compulsive?

Not at all

Not at all uh any tattoos?

No

What do you think was the most challenging component at buds? Think
about your

hardest days at buds

Basically for me the hardest … (Inteligible 52-09)

And what motivated you to push through it

Well I knew that I had to do it I decided this a long time ago and I
knew that if I didnt

pass it and if i did drop that my life direction would be non existent
(inteligible

26-30)

Hey guys can you try and keep it down a little bit ok for the
interviews? Please thanks Uh

um what what practices do you have any practices that helped you
especially during the challenging phases of buds so peaceful practices
mental practices spiritual daily practices

A lot of in the moment ones its kind of like the very stereotypical box
breathing that definitely helped like in the moment like on the pool
deck before pool comp to calm me down um and then just like a lot of
reflection like at the end of the day I really I really would think
about the reasons for being here and be like yeah this is sometimes
terrible sometimes not and I just kinda reflect the long time it took to
get here the first time and get back the second time and be like well
theres no other option so i guess just intentionality mindedness for
lack of better wording

And did you find yourself doing that reflection each day?

Yes very frequently even throughout the day when things start getting
low I kinda would look back at the past couple of years and remember why
I was here and who I was and all that kind of stuff. Sounds like what we
talked about before its the mindedness portion i think thats the biggest
thing.

Yeah. So uh when you made a difficult decision during uh BUD/S what went
through your mind as you made that decision? Was there a decision that
you really struggled with while you were here?

I cant think of like one decision in particular um I just really thought
about long term consequences like if I do this now am I going to be able
to live with myself in five years, ten years whats my wife going to
think about that um what kind of legacy would that leave behind …
(inaudible 15-1020)

Why do you think you were successful in BUD/S?

Because I decided I had to. I had made this projection for this life and
the man who I wanted to be and (inaudible 32-38) looking back to
now i decided there was there was no other option so thats really it
once you make that kind of commitment. Kind of game over in my opinion.

Did you notice anything different um from the guys who didnt make it?

I think a lot of the guys who didnt make it through were kind of here
for the I guess the status, they didnt necessarily want to do the job
and be the man that this requires. I never really thought too much about
that though honestly, in regards to other people I kind of just you know
like remained focused on my own development and tried not to judge other
guys so I dont know if I have the best perspective on that.

How did you feel like this changed you as a person?

Ive uh yeah Ive grown a lot ive matured a lot I feel like ive aged
significantly from coming here and then trying to come back and then
actually making it through on the second go around (inaudible
36-40)

Is there anything that you think uh I should be asking you about what
helped you or hurt you coming to BUD/S?

I wouldn't even know what to begin with for those kind of questions I
think these are probably a good place to start for your background
checks. I guess (inaudible 59-02) more questions about
mindfulness. Once you know who you are and what you want you can truly
articulate that and there is nothing else that can stop you so I think
mindfulness is (inaudible 10-18).

Awesome. Sounds good. Alright that is all I got, Hey thanks a lot.

Thank you Sir.

I really appreciate it.

SO YOU COMPLETED THE CONSENT. AND DO I HAVE YOUR CONSENT TO RECORD?

YES.

OK, GREAT. SO YOUR NUMBER, YOU CAN TELL ME YOUR NUMBER AND SORT OF
EXPLAIN THE SITUATION...

MY OLD CARD WAS 115. IT WAS LOST LAST TIME I CHECKED IN. SO WE SWITCHED
IT TO 353 WITH THE NEW INFORMATION.

OK. SO WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S CLASS?

I CAME TO CORONADO WITH CLASS 337. I WAS ROLLED OUT OF ORIENTATION, DID
NOT CLASS UP WITH FIRST PHASE WITH 337. I SECURED HELL WEEK WITH 338.

OK. AND WAS THIS YOUR GOAL, WAS THAT WAS YOUR FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE?

YES.

CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING IT THIS FAR.

THANK YOU.

SO COULD WE TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? DO YOU HAVE ANY SIBLINGS?

I HAVE ONE YOUNGER BROTHER IS THREE YEARS YOUNGER.

CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DYNAMICS? WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED,
DIVORCED AND SEPARATED?

BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE MARRIED? SO, YEAH, THEY HAVE GOOD, GOOD
RELATIONSHIP. THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER MY WHOLE LIFE.

AND HOW HAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM?

IT'S GOOD. I'LL TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME STILL WHILE I'M HERE. GROWING
UP, WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE TYPICAL RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC YOU WOULD EXPECT
BETWEEN YOUR PARENTS AND KIDS. BUT I'VE TALKED TO THEM A LOT.

SO, ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?

I'M PROUD OF BUD/S YES, SO I WAS IN COLLEGE AND PURSUING MY DEGREE
EARNED MYSELF A NIGHT IN JAIL ON A DUI. SO THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG
TURNING POINT IN MY LIFE. I WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO
ME, BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I REALLY TURNED MY SIGHTS FROM SCHOOL TO
FOCUSING ON THIS ACTUALLY INTO BEING SUSPENDED FOR A SEMESTER OF COLLEGE
MY THIRD YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT. AND THEN FROM THERE, I DECIDED TO
CONTINUE MY EDUCATION AND GO ON TO START TRAINING FOR THIS ASSESSMENT. I
LEFT I DIDN'T EARN MY DEGREE. AND I DIDN'T DID NOT FINISH. YES. SO I
LEFT AND STARTED TRAINING FOR THIS. AND A YEAR LATER, I JOINED THE
MILITARY.

OK. SO YOU ENLISTED?

YES.

HOW DO YOU THINK? AND IF SO, HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTORED
INTO YOUR EXPERIENCES AT BUD/S?

SO I THINK THAT JUST KNOWING THAT I CAN OVERCOME HARDSHIPS ARE WHEN
THINGS WERE- THINGS WAS A PRETTY DARK TIME FOR ME AT THAT TIME, AS WELL
AS REALLY DISAPPOINTING MYSELF AND CONTINUE TO GO ON. I THINK THAT
KNOWING THAT I CAN COULD OVERCOME, YOU KNOW, LIKE CHANGE EVENTS SUCH AS
THAT GOING INTO BUD/S. I KNEW THAT WHATEVER THEY'D THROW AT ME THAT I
CAN OVERCOME IT.

SO, KNOWING YOU COULD OVERCOME ADVERSITY?

YES.

HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY AFFECTED YOUR PROGRESSION THROUGH
BUD/S?

I CONSIDER MYSELF A PRETTY AMICABLE PERSON. I CAN KIND OF TALK WITH
PEOPLE, CONNECT WITH PEOPLE. SO THAT'S I THINK THE BIG THING HERE WITH
THE EMPHASIS ON TEAMWORK IS, YOU KNOW, CREATING GOOD, STRONG
RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE AROUND YOU. SO I THINK THAT WAS A BIG PART OF
IT, WAS BEING ABLE TO KIND OF INTEGRATE WITH THE CLASS FULL OF TYPE A,
VERY HARDHEADED PEOPLE. SO IT WORKED OUT REALLY WELL AND IT WORKED. I
THINK I BECAME PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT EVERYONE IN CLASS.

SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE AGREEABLE. YOU TALKED ABOUT GOOD COMMUNICATION
SKILLS.

YEAH I BELIEVE SO. I THINK THAT I CAN CONVEY MY THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS TO
PEOPLE IN A DIRECT MANNER, BUT ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN RESPOND
TO.

AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING.

YES.

OK... WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF COMPETITIVE?

YES. ABSOLUTELY. I GREW UP PLAYING SPORTS ALL MY LIFE. I'VE PLAYED THREE
SPORTS ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMPETITIVE
DRIVE AND DESIRE TO SUCCEED.

BUT SOMEHOW MANAGING TO BALANCE THAT WITH OTHERS, BUT ALSO RELATIONSHIP
BUILDING?

WELL, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, I THINK COMPETITION IS- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HEALTHY COMPETITION AND ONE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE... RAISE YOUR
PERSONAL STATION AND BE DETRIMENTAL TO OTHERS. BUT I THINK
COMPETITIVENESS AND GOOD DRIVE WILL TO SUCCEED IS VERY IMPORTANT.
HOWEVER, HAVING THAT COMPETITIVENESS, YOU ALSO WANT THE PEOPLE AROUND
YOU TO SUCCEED WITH YOU. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE ESSENCE OF TEAMWORK
AND SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

SO DESCRIBE ANYTHING IN YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING
PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY? DID YOU HAVE ANY SEAL MENTORS OR IS THERE
SOMEBODY IN THE FAMILY OR FRIEND?

THE FAMILY. FAMILY FRIEND- I GREW UP IN VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA. SO
IT'S YOU KNOW, THAT'S A BIG HALF OF THE COMMUNITY OVER THERE. SO I'D
ALWAYS KIND OF SEEN THEM WALKING AROUND AND WHATNOT. AND FROM A YOUNG
AGE, YOU KNOW, KNOWING WHO THEY WERE, AND KINDA HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY
DID. YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT, SAY,
"YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS ARE THE ONES THAT PROTECT US AND WHATNOT." THAT'S
KIND OF WHERE IT STARTED GOING BACK MY HEAD. BUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG
ENOUGH, IT SOUND LIKE SUCH AN INSURMOUNTABLE THING. BUT GROWING UP, WE
HAD A COUPLE OF FAMILY, FRIENDS WHO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD TALK TO AND THE
PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE I WANTED TO EMULATE. SO FROM THERE, IT WAS ALWAYS
KIND OF THOUGHT THAT, HEY, I'M MAY PURSUE THIS.

SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR... PARENTS? HOW HOW YOU DISCIPLINED?

CORPORAL PUNISHMENT WAS A VERY BIG PART OF- SPANKINGS AND THE BELT AND
WHATNOT. YES.

OK. THERE WAS A BELT?

YES, THERE WAS DEFINITELY A BELT.

AND LIKE THROUGH WHAT AGE DO YOU THINK?

I WAS PROBABLY LIKE 10 I SO WOULD PROBABLY BE THE LATEST THAT WAS, YOU
KNOW, AS I STARTED TO GROW OLDER, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY WILL JUST TREAT ME
LIKE AN ADULT. AND WHEN I MADE MISTAKES, I WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
THOSE MISTAKES. SO THAT WAS, WHEN I GOT OLDER AND TEENAGE YEARS AND WHAT
NOT. IT WAS MORE GROUNDING AND KIND OF RESTRICTING MY FREEDOMS BECAUSE I
WOULD SAY THEY GOT BREACHED THEIR TRUST OR SOMETHING. SO BECAUSE OF
THAT, MY FREEDOM WOULD BE RESTRICTED.

TAKING VIDEO GAMES AWAY?

I DIDN'T PLAY ANY VIDEO GAMES, BUT JUST GROUNDING. I COULDN'T GO PLAY
WITH MY FRIENDS. AND, YOU KNOW, YEAH THE CAR ONCE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IS
A BIG THING.

AND DID YOU MOVE AROUND THROUGH YOUR CHILDHOOD?

NO, I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN, VIRGINIA BEACH, THE SAME HOUSE.

OK, SAME HOUSE.

YES, YES.

AND THEN TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. YOU MENTIONED SPORTS? ANY
TEAM SPORTS?

YES, YES. I PLAYED BASEBALL, FOOTBALL. I SWAM FROM 9TH GRADE ON MIDDLE
SCHOOL AS WELL.

FOUR YEARS?

YES. YES. SO THE SCHOOL, I WENT TO A FIRST THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE PRIVATE
SCHOOL. SO IT WAS YOU KNOW, YOU WERE IN THE SAME BUILDING YOUR ENTIRE
YOUR ENTIRE TIME IN SCHOOL. SO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL WERE ALWAYS
MORE BLENDED THAN IT WOULD BE IN, YOU KNOW, TYPICAL ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE,
HIGH SCHOOL.

FEELING THE TEAM DYNAMICS, SORT OF LEARNING HOW TO WORK ON A TEAM?

ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, THE PEOPLE THAT I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH, I WAS PRETTY
MUCH WITH FROM FIRST GRADE ON. SO, YOU KNOW, VERY STRONG RELATIONS
THERE. AND SO IT WAS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW EACH OTHER VERY WELL
GOING INTO WHEN WE PLAYED THE TEAM SPORTS. SO THAT WAS A GOOD, GOOD
RELATIONSHIPS BUILT EARLY ON.

SO THIS QUESTION ASKS ABOUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE
BUD/S, I THINK YOU ANSWERED, THAT YOU HAD THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE?

YES, I DID COLLEGE. AND THEN WHEN I WHEN I LEFT COLLEGE, I CAME BACK
HOME AND WORKED ODD JOBS. I WORKED IN A RESTAURANT FOR WHILE. I WAS A
SERVER. I WAS I WAS- MY SUMMER JOB WAS A VIRGINIA BEACH LIFEGUARD. SO I
DID THAT FOR EIGHT YEARS EVERY SUMMER. THAT WAS A BIG PART OF A LOT OF
PHYSICAL TRAINING INVOLVED IN THAT. AND OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOU KNOW,
WORKED OUT A LOT AND THEN GOT ON CERTAIN PROGRAMS LIFTING PROGRAMS AND
RUNNING PROGRAMS. ONCE I HAD, YOU KNOW, SET MY SIGHTS DIRECTLY ON MY
DOCK TO BUD/S, WHICH WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE A
REALLY GOOD TURNING POINT DEFINING MOMENT WHEN I STARTED, "I'M GOING TO
TRAIN FOR THIS.".

OK, GREAT. WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR EXAMPLE, DO YOU
HAVE ANY TATTOOS YOU JUST GOT ON A WHIM, OR SPEEDING TICKETS?

I HAVE TATTOOS, I HAVE SPEEDING TICKETS. YES. I DID LIKE TO DRIVE FAST
FROM TIME TO TIME.

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A SPEEDING TICKET?

SAY, FOUR YEARS AGO, THE LAST TIME. BUT IMPULSIVE ISN'T TATTOO'S OR
MAKING RASH DECISIONS IF-.

BIG PURCHASES.

YES, IF IT'S A BIG PURCHASE OR SOMETHING, THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT ME FOR
A LONG PERIOD TIME AFTER I MAKE THAT DECISION, I TYPICALLY AM PRETTY
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THAT. I'D SAY THAT MOST OF THE MISTAKES I MADE MY LIFE
WERE SOMETHING WHERE THIS WAS KINDA YOUNGER AND MORE THAN MY DECISION
MAKING FROM THAT. BUT IF I MADE A MISTAKE, IT WAS BECAUSE OF AN IMPULSE
DECISION AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK NOW, AS I'VE GROWN UP, MATURED A
BIT, THAT RASH DECISIONS ARE FEWER AND FURTHER BETWEEN. AND I'M MORE
THOUGHTFUL IN MY DECISION MAKING AND THE WHETHER THEY'RE NEGATIVE OR
POSITIVE IMPACTS THE DECISIONS HAVE.

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? THIS IS KIND OF A
HOLISTIC QUESTION. SO IT COULD BE A PARTICULAR DAY OR COULD BE SORT OF A
GENERAL- THE WATER. YOU KNOW WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY BEEN A
CHALLENGE FOR YOU TO OVERCOME?

I THINK IT WAS OVERALL JUST BEING DOUBTFUL OF... MY ABILITY TO DO SO.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INCREDIBLE ATHLETES, INCREDIBLE
DRIVEN PEOPLE. THAT WAS KIND OF A THOUGHT OF... YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE
GUYS QUIT, YOU THOUGHT WERE ABSOLUTE STUDS AND LIKE, OKAY, THESE GUYS
CAN'T MAKE IT. WILL I BE ABLE TO? SO I THINK THAT JUST LIKE ON A DAY TO
DAY BASIS, LIKE, HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET UP AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS TO
THE BEST YOU CAN AND WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS. BUT I THINK THIS MENTAL
ASPECT IS IS BY FAR THE MOST CHALLENGING PART PHYSICALLY. EVERYONE CAN
DO IT, BUT MENTALLY IS WHERE IT SEPARATES WHO DOES AND WHO SUCCEEDS AND
FAILS.

SO WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH? HOW DID YOU GET PAST THAT, "SELF
TALK"?

THAT'S, I THINK JUST LOOKING FOR THE GUY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF YOU.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOWL DON'T DO IT FOR YOURSELF, DO IT FOR THE GUY NEXT TO
YOU. SO IF YOU'RE GONE, THEY'RE GOING TO BE CARRYING MORE WEIGHT BECAUSE
YOU'RE GONE. SO IN ORDER TO CONTINUE ON, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE GUY
NEXT TO YOU IS OK, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS.

OK. YOU WERE DOING IT TO SUPPORT THEM. DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE
GROUP?

YES. YES, I DID. I MEAN, I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH- THE GUYS IN MY BOAT
CREW WHO WERE ALSO OF SIMILAR HEIGHTS. YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS FORTUNATE
TO HAVE A GROUP OF SOLID GUYS WHO WE BECAME VERY CLOSE WITH. SO THAT
DRIVING FACTOR OF, "I CARE ABOUT THESE GUYS. I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED AS
MUCH AS I WANT TO SUCCEED." SO I THINK THAT REALLY IS WHAT PUSHED ME ALL
THE WAY THROUGH.

WERE YOU EVER THINKING ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO WASN'T IN THAT IMMEDIATE
SITUATION LIKE THAT WHEN HE DOESN'T WANT YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR-

I THINK IT WOULD BE MY MENTORS, PEOPLE THAT I TALKED TO WHEN I TOLD
THEM, LIKE, I'M GOING TO DO THIS, LIKE YOU SAID, TO DO THIS DREAM GO ALL
THE WAY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME BACK UNTIL YOU FAIL SO-.

WERE YOU EVER THINKING ABOUT THEM IN THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS HARD?

UMMM, NO IT WAS MORE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S LIKE, HEY, "I MADE
IT THROUGH ANOTHER DAY." I CAN TELL THEM THAT I'M CONTINUING ON. BUT IN
A MOMENT, IT WAS THE GUYS THAT DRIVED ME.

 SO DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES, PHYSICAL AND MENTAL, SPIRITUAL THAT
YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES? ANY PRAYERS, OR MANTRAS,
SOMETIMES ATHLETES WILL DO A ROUTINE BEFORE THEY GO INTO A GAME
SITUATION. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU USED?

I SAID THE SIMPLE MANTRA IN MY HEAD, IT WAS, KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
"BROTHERS DO IT FOR THEM. AND THAT WAS JUST IN THE SAME VEIN FOR THE
GUYS THAT I DID NOT DO IT FOR THEM." SO I WOULD TELL MYSELF THAT THINGS
ARE ROUGH.

I'M SORRY I COULDN'T HEAR THE, "DO IT FOR THEM". WHO IS THEM?

IT'S A VERY BROAD THING, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF ENCOMPASSES THE GUYS
BESIDE ME AS WELL AS, YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS BACK HOME.

 SO WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING TO BUD/S.
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? AND WHAT WAS
THERE A DECISION YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH AN EXAMPLE LIKE APPEARANCE,
RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT, OR TURNING INTO A CHEATING CLASSMATE. REALLY
STRUGGLE WITH ANY DECISION?

RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT WAS A BIG ONE. YOU KNOW, I LIKE THEM AS A PERSON?
BUT, IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE A LIABILITY AND CAUSE OF INJURY TO MYSELF
OR THE GUYS WHO WERE PUTTING OUT AND PERFORMING, THEN, YES, IT'S ALWAYS
TOUGH TO SEE THAT. BUT IN THE END, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION
THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE OF THE CLASS. SO IF SOMEONE WASN'T
KEEPING UP OR WASN'T CARRYING THEIR WEIGHT, THEN... THEY NEED TO BE
REMOVED FROM THE PROGRAM.

GETTING BACK TO THIS LARGER- WHAT'S WHAT'S BETTER FOR THE GREATEST
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

EXACTLY.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THIS FAR?

I THINK A BIG PART OF IT WAS HAVING THOSE MENTORS AND KIND OF HAVING
IDEA WHAT WAS COMING. SO BEING MENTALLY PREPARED FOR IT AND KNOWING, YOU
KNOW, IT'S GOING TO SUCK FOR A WHILE, BUT YOU CAN DO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU HAVE DONE IT.

AND DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE IT?
THOSE THAT DROPPED?

I THINK THERE WAS A FEAR- WHETHER THAT WAS A FEAR OF FAILURE OR FEAR OF
OF WHAT'S TO COME NEXT RATHER THAN, YOU KNOW, JUST BEING IN THAT MOMENT-
WAS THE BIGGEST DEFINING FACTOR. GUYS WOULD MOST OF THE GUYS THAT QUIT,
QUIT BEFORE AN EVOLUTION, NOT DURING IT, BUT BEFORE IT BECAUSE, IT WAS
"OH I'M SCARED TO DO THIS. THIS GUY IS JUST GOING TO SUCK." SO I THINK
THERE WAS A TREND THAT I SAW THESE IN THE CLASSES IN MY CLASS IN FIRST
PHASE WAS IF GUYS WERE QUITTING, IT WAS A QUIET MOMENT IN BETWEEN AN
EVOLUTION.

 SO HOW DOES THIS EXPERIENCE, BUD/S, CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? AND IF
SO, HOW?

ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT THE CONFIDENCE, KNOWING
WHAT YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU CAN THROW AT ME, WHATEVER THE INSTRUCTOR
THROWS ME, WHATEVER SITUATION IS GOING TO BE, IT DOESN'T MATTER, YOU'RE
GONNA GET THROUGH IT.

IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? I HAVEN'T ASKED THAT YOU- INSIGHTS YOU HAVE TO,
WHAT WOULD MAKE A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR
WHEN WE SCREEN?

NO, I THINK THOSE QUESTIONS ARE PRETTY GOOD THINGS. IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
ASKING ABOUT THE MENTAL ASPECT. WHAT YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, MENTALLY IN
YOUR IN YOUR HEADSPACE, THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST ASPECT OF IT. BUT I
THINK TO THOSE QUESTIONS, COVERED IT PRETTY WELL.

THANKS SO MUCH. HIT STOP.

This is participant 354. So I just have a series of questions - we got
about fifteen minutes to go over them - they are somewhat open ended
questions, so answer them however you feel appropriate.

Okay, Awesome.

Um when did you start BUD/S?

Started BUD/S, let’s see, I started with 38. Um, I couldn’t tell you the
exact date, I believe it was in June.

Of ‘19?

Yes, umm, But yeah I couldn’t tell you the exact date of when we started
BUD/S Orientation, but I know it was somewhere around then.

Um is this your first BUD/S?

Yes.

How many uh siblings do you have?

I have two sisters.

Are they older, younger?

Uh, both of them are older.

So sister - sister - you?

Yep.

What was your, um, parental situation growing up?

Umm… had ya know, mom and dad were never divorced. Had a really solid
family life. Umm, they were really supportive.

So your parents are married?

Yep.

What’s your relationship with them now, is it good?

Uh..yeah - normal. Good relationship with my parents. Call them about
once a week.

What, if any, life-changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?

Uhhmm. I wouldn’t say there were any big life changing event. Ya know, I
don’t really have any big life changing moments like that.

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression
through BUD/S?

Umm… I’d say just being like stubborn, or not, I guess, just the idea of
ya know whatever the guy next to me can take, I can take that. Kind of
uh, tough and competitive personality.

Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the
SEAL community? So for instance, do you have any SEALs as family or
friends? Do you have any um family members in the military? How did you
- what motivated you to do this?

So I don’t know anybody in the community. Umm, and the only people in
the military in my family were my grandpa on my dad’s side - I believe
he was in the Army. And then my great grandpa on my mom’s side was in
the Navy. Umm, but they never really talked about their involvement in
the military. Umm so I wouldn’t say I had much of a military influence
growing up. If I did, I would say I probably would’ve decided to do this
sooner. Umm, but yeah, I didn’t really have any military influences, I
just decided to do it.

So there - so there’s no military influence, but what made you decide
to?

So, I decided to do it just because I uh finished college and… I - just
to back track from that - so I grew up on a farm. I, uh, kinda always
had it in my head that I was gonna farm someday, and I was always
working on the family farm, ya know every summer. When I got to college
it was just every summer, but growing up I was always helping out. And
uh, I uh, ya know, I knew that - it was kind of like when you know your
future - it’s almost a little scary, ya know. Like when you know exactly
where you’re going to be - I wanted something that was exciting,
something that was challenging. Umm, I always had this idea in my mind
that I would do something big. I really had no, no reason to think that
- just kind of always had this sense of confidence that I could
accomplish something, but I never really had a chance to prove that,
until I decided I was gonna do this pipeline. Um, so I would say, ya
know, after college, just working on the farm, driving tractor for long
hours, listening to podcasts of, ya know, ex-Navy SEALS, and, um kind of
getting turned on to um, the uh, the challenge of it, kind of led me to
wanna pursue that and see a recruiter and start talking about it.

Okay, so tell me a little bit about your childhood - for example, how
were you disciplined?

Umm.. so as far as disciplining, I was definitely spanked - um ya know
for, for good reason, and I deserved it when, when it happened. Umm..I
think my dad, uh, used a belt like one time, um, in a, ya know, a
spanking way, um but definitely no abuse or anything like that. It was -
I have no, ya know, traumatic memories of that happening.

Did you get grounded, or have things taken away?

Yeah - yeah. Uh I remember in high school I got my truck taken away for
a while. Umm, yeah I’d say - spankings, umm, yeah nothing too crazy.

Did you move, uh, through your childhood and teenage years?

No, I stayed - I like moved - so on the farm I grew up in this kindof
older house, and then we built a new house right next to it, so I lived
in the same little small town my whole life.

Where?

Uh it’s right outside Sacramento.

Oh in California?

Yeah, in California.

So tell me about your teenage years, did you participate in team sports?

Yeah so, my freshman year I wrestled and played football. My sophomore
year I just played football. And then, my junior year I played
basketball and wrestled, or played basketball and played football,
because between my sophomore and junior year I switched high schools and
they didn’t have a wrestling team, so I decided to play basketball
instead. And then my senior year I believe I did, uh, football and
track.

What have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/S?

Uh last five years - let’s see so 20 to, or 19 to 24. So I was up at
Chico State, I was going to school up there, um graduated in 2017. And
then, after college I traveled for about a month - and then, started
working on a ranch down outside of Monterey, where I worked until I
decided to do this. So I worked there for almost two years, um, mostly
doing manual labor, driving tractor, um working with livestock, so
basically just living kind of a ranch life. Tra- training, uh after
work, running, um I didn’t know how to swim so I had to teach myself how
to swim, kindof after I had already talked to a recruiter. I failed my
first PST horribly. Uh, and then got in the pool like every day.

What’s a PST?

PST is like the physical screening test.

The screening test?

Yeah - so they, you have like a swim time and I think it’s like 12
minutes to pass. I was like - it’s a 500 yard swim and I had never swam
500 yards before in my life. So I like, ya know, realized I had a lot of
work to do. And then, like, one, I like swam everyday and passed and
they gave me a contact, and I was like holy crap, about to go, ya know,
to bootcamp, and I just learned how to swim, ya know, like a month ago.
So that was kind of the uh...

In Navy bootcamp do you do any swimming?

You do, you do - they don’t teach you anything. Ya know in Prep they
taught you how to swim a little bit, in BUD/S Prep. But uh, that was
probably where I had - ya know, the biggest warrior for me was the
water. Because, ya know, it’s not like I, ya know, didn’t know how to, I
had swam before and gone to the lake and ya know swam, ya know, but I
never really like swam laps or had any formal training and, ya know,
swimming lessons and stuff like that, so. But yeah, to get back to your
question, it was either, ya know, during the summer working on the farm,
during the school year going to college, and then after college back to
work on a different ranch.

So after you - so, you quit working on the ranch and joined the Navy?

Yeah, so uh.

How long have you been in the Navy?

I’ve been in the Navy for about a year now.

So you signed up specifically to come to BUD/S?

Right - yeah.

So you, you came in, you went to boot camp...

Yep.

And then you went to..

BUD/S Prep

Great, Great Lakes?

Yep

And then here?

Yep.

Alright, wow. Um, would you consider yourself to be impulsive?

Uh, I can be, yeah, I would say so.

And it sounds like you decided to join the Navy, that - that wasn’t
really an impulsive decision, it was, ya know, thinking about it, right?

Kind of, I kinda... I kind of realized that like I was ya know - I think
I was still 24 at the time. Um, or no I was 23 at the time. I kind of
like, kind of had like a life crisis I guess, an early life crisis.
Where uh, I figured ya know I can do this farming thing for the rest of
my life and get into it right now, or I can do this - ya know - try the
whole Navy SEAL thing, and ya know, do something more. Um, I guess you
could kind of say, I just, I just felt kinda stuck, I needed uh, needed
a change. So...and, ya know I feel like most all the guys that make it,
they just kind of have this sense about them, or they, they have some,
some sort of, ya know, confidence that just, I don’t know what is stems
from but they just - they know they’re going to make it. Ya know, like
when I signed away 6 years of my life, like, I knew I was going to make
it. Ya know, I mean, if you don’t believe it, then ya know who’s going
to believe it? So, looking back on it, it seems pretty crazy that I just
like signed a paper, ya know, here we go, six years but, ya know it’s
all worked out, so.

Do you have any tattoos?

No, no tattoos.

That’s an example of impulsivity, or so, or so they think.

Right, yeah.

Or so someone has written.

Makes sense.

What was the most challenging part of, of BUD/S? Like a particular
event, or particular day or?

Umm, I’d say first phase was the worst, I mean that’s where I was had,
ya know, I was tested the most was definitely in first phase, where ya
know, for me I would say like the log PT’s were, were the hardest thing
for me. Um, coming into it I thought the water was going to be the
hardest thing. But uh, I would say log PT and OC8. I got rolled for OC8,
that’s why I got rolled to 39 - so pool comp. Um, but...

Is that where a lot of people get rolled?

Yeah that’s pretty common. But uh..

For the drown-proofing, or ?

Uh so that was in first phase - I didn’t have any problem with that, uh,
but in OC8 I, I uh failed it - ya know, I passed my fifth attempt so I
failed it - passed out like two times, almost three times in the water.
Um, so yeah I would say probably logs and pool comp were the two hardest
things for me.

So what motivated you to push through?

Just being stubborn I would say - just, ya know - and then, thinking
about, like I always had a rationale, like clear head, where when you
quit, you like know where you’re going. It’s like - yes, you’re gonna ya
know have comfort for, ya know, that day, but ya know your mind isn’t
going to let you live that down that you quit, and then to go home, ya
know, and tell your family that you quit, and all your friends and
everyone that knows that you’re doing this pipeline, ya know. There’s a
lot, a lot on the line there, so. No matter how bad it was. As long, as
long as you - as long as I kept a rational mind and thought about the
consequences of what it means to quit I was never going to do it. And,
ya know, I never thought about doing it as hard as it got, ya know.
There were times where I was like worried that am I going to get
performance dropped right now, am I like not performing well enough
right now. But never in my mind was it that I was going to go
voluntarily end my BUD/S career, ya know.

Did you feel like you were supported by others?

Oh yeah, yeah, because you are with the guys since boot camp, so -
you’re all, all in it together. For sure.

So what practices, and to some extent you just answered this - but maybe
there’s something more, what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, or
etc. did you use to push through the challenges?

Um, I think the biggest thing for me, was like I said, just keeping, not
making an emotional decision, and keeping your rational mind where ya
think about, ya know, how stupid it is to quit, especially when you’ve
made it this far. Like by the time you get to Hell Week, you’ve already
put in, ya know, months and months of training, and boot camp, and BUD/S
Prep, and BUD/S Orientation, just like by that time it’s like, ya know,
it doesn’t make any sense to just tap out, ya know because...

When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went
through your mind as you made the decision? Um, and what decision, you
can give an example, did you really struggle with? And the examples that
give here are: running classmates out or turning in someone who’s
cheating.

Um, let me think about that one for a second. Um. I can’t think of any
particular instance. I know...I know that’s happened, ya know. That
happens a lot in this pipeline, ya know. Like, If someone is really
underperforming, they will get run out. And then, as far as turning
someone in, like my attitude, um, would be to handle things in class,
and not, and handle it at the lowest level. But, I really can’t think of
any decision I’ve made personally, although I have witnessed, witnessed
those kinds of decisions being made.

Did you notice - so, we’re pretty much out of time, I don’t know where
the time went here- um, why do you think you were successful in
completing BUD/S?

I would say just, it sounds super cliche, but just showed up everyday
and didn’t quit. That’s all it comes down to - I’m sure you hear that
from everybody, but, just a stubborn guy that doesn’t quit.

Did you notice anything different about the folks who didn’t make it?

Uh, I would say they had a moment of weakness and made an emotional
decision. Um, other than that, that’s ya know, everyone has a time where
it’s like, ya know - they, everyone has something they struggle with ya
know, and some people get through it and some people feel sorry for
themselves, and just end up quitting. So - they make an emotional
decision and just want to get out of the pain right away, and just, just
quit.

How did this experience change you as a person, if it did?

Um, I would say it just makes you realize that you can do things that
before you thought were impossible I guess, or. Basically you are
capable of so much more - and the human body can do so much that, ya
know. When you are pushed to do something, you can step up to the plate
and do it, so.

Well, that’s about it, so thanks.

Cool, thank you.

This is particiopany 356. I've got about eight questions broken into
100 parts each, broken into a few parts each so uh but we've got 15 so
we should be able to get through it. So they're somewhat open ended
questions but ya know if you keep your answers relatively concise we
should be able to make it all the way through.

Oh yeah I shouldn't have a problem with that.

When did you start BUD/S?

Oh I started May of 2019.

18 or 19?

19.

19. Is this your first BUD/S experience?

Yes it is.

How many siblings do you have?

Uh I have three siblings.

Whats uh the uh sex and uh sequence?

Uh I have three older sisters.

Three older sisters. Just out of curiosity, how old is the oldest?

I think she's about to be 30 or is already 30. I'm not 100 percent
sure.

Wha- what's your uh parental situation growing up? What was it?

Uh great I...

Mom, Dad?

I have a mom and dad yeah.

And then your parents were married?

Yes

And you have, do you have, what's the relationship you have with them
right now?

Uh I have a fantastic relationship with them.

So what, if any, uh life changing events happened in your life prior
    to coming to BUD/S?

Uh I’d say the main thing was uh my best friend died when he was 16.
He had a heart attack.

One of my best friends died in a car accident at that age. Two of them
actually together. Um how did that factor or that experience factor
into your uh experience at BUD/S?

Um it it's the sole reason I'm here really. It's like the big
overarching reason I acutally came. Uh I think it helped me a lot to
keep in mind that I was doing this for uh more for people than just my
own sake.

In what way?

Uh it just made me uh put into put my life into retrospect for myself
and realize that uh i should never be doing things for myself i should
just try to help others as much as possible and I think that's helped
a lot going through buds.

How do you think your personality contributed to your progression
through BUD/S?

Umm im pretty quiet and reserved guy so i think uh it kinda helped
just keeping my head down and not making a lot of noise.

So describe your background that led you to pursuing becoming a part
of the SEAL community? Uh do you have any SEALs as family members or
friends?

No no actually uh my parents aren't even, they're from England so
they’re not even citizens of the US. I just uh one day wanted to do
something more than just working construction back home so I went to
the recruiter's office and they handed me the pamphlet for this
program and uh I decided to do it.

Ok so let me ask some questions about your childhood. How were you
disciplined as a child?

Uh my parents were always strict like they never like beat me if I did
anything wrong, they just...

Were you spanked or?

No no no they just corrected by talking to me sitting down explaining
why things were wrong and why I shouldn’t do them.

Did you move throughout your childhood?

Yes uh three or four times.

Were these uh like uh major moves or?

Yeah I moved from um Massachusetts to Texas back and forth both times,
all the times

Massachusetts to Texas to Massachusetts and…

Back to Texas yeah

So MA to Texas to Massachusetts to Texas again. Quite a cultural
change.

Yes it was.

Um tell me about your teenage years. Were you involved in high school
sports or team events or team ya know community or anything like that?

I played lacrosse, football and I ran track and cross country.

Any other team events?

Uh i was on the robotics team

What have you done for the list 5 years prior to coming to BUD/S?

Um I’m 21 so I was in high school and then uh I worked construction
and landscaping and I worked in a restaurant.

Like as a cook or as waiter or…?

Uh, I was a waiter.

And then you joined the Navy?

Yup I joined the navy.

Did you go straight from signing up or enlisting to um…. So no
college?

No college.

So did you, you enlisted and you went straight to basic or bootcamp or
whatever its called in the Navy?

Yes.

And um then to Great Lakes?

Then to Great Lakes.

Then here. Like a lot of people follow that, follow that track. Would
you consider yourself as impulsive?

No

Do you have any tattoos?

I do

How many

One

Is that supposed to be a sign of impulsive?

Oh I thought about that one for a long time.

Yeah some still think it's that way. What was the most challenging
    component of BUD/S either like a hardest day or hardest event or?

Um life saving was probably one of the harder ones. It's a lot of...
(unintelligible 00-01)... stress during the actual event too.

What's involved in that?

Um you have to uh buddy tow on of the instructors across the pool but
uh there's three different types of rescues you have to do you have to
do an active front, an active rear, and a passive and so during the
active and the, the active front and rear, they’re fighting you the
whole time so they'll like grab you and roll or they’ll grab you and
try and like pull you under water. Like act like a panicking victim so
you have to uh react to the situation and follow the proper procedures
to break away and uh successfully tow them to the other side keeping
their head above the water.

So what motivated you to push through?

Uh I mean I just... Same thing for uhh all of BUD/S pretty much I knew
I wanted to be here. After uh seeing all the guys around me just the
whole mental attitude of everyone here and uh I wasn't gonna quit.

Did you feel a lot of support from the, from everyone else, from the
group?

Oh yeah everyone is always supporting everybody.

Were there any practices that you used like physical, mental,
spiritual to help you get through?

Um I mean yeah I'm religious. I'm not like overtly religious but I
definitely am, I pray, I think about that stuff a lot but also like
breathing staying calm and keeping collected the whole time.

When you made a difficult decision during training, what went
    through your mind as you made that decision? Uh so was there a
    decision at some point that you really struggled with? Like for
    instance uh whether to turn someone in for cheating or to run
    someone out?

Uh it’s pretty easy uh I just always did something, did whatever was
right like uh either morally or by the instructions that were given to
us. My boat crew never had to run anyone out. We were all pretty
tight, pretty close with each other.

So so was there ever a difficult decision?

Uh in my opinion no, i think it was all pretty cut and dry. What we
were supposed to be doing.

Why do you think you were successful at completing buds?

Uh I think cuz I didn't ever have the idea that I was gonna quit. Once
I was here I was gonna be here the whole time.

Did you notice anything different about the people who didn't make it
through?

Honestly I didn't really think a lot about them. Obviously you know
people who quit but you only them for such a short period of time you
never get to know them all that well.

How quickly do they drop out?

Uh like 1st phase you know the first three weeks a lot of people drop
and then uh obviously the fourth week, Hell Week, it's not actually
that many that drop during Hell Week but uh within the first four
weeks you pretty much know who's gonna be here and who's not.

So how did this experience change you as a person?

Um I think it it really just reinforced what uh I already believed in.
Just doing the right thing no matter what.

Is there anything else that I should have asked you about that I
haven't that helped you or hurt you uh in getting through BUD/S?

No I don't think so anything in particular.

Pretty much said everything?

Yeah.

Ok.

Alright then.

We’re done.

Thank you very much sir.

IS IT OK IF I RECORD?

IT IS OK.

GREAT. AND CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR PARTICIPANT ID AND SORT OF EXPLAIN WHY
YOU HAVE TWO NUMBERS HERE?

81 AND 358. 81 WAS GIVEN TO ME IN CLASS 338 AFTER I GOT ROLLED. I WAS
GIVEN A NUMBER 358, IN 339.

AWESOME. THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THAT. SO WHEN DID YOU START BUD/S WITH
THAT ORIGINAL CLASS?

AS IN CORONADO, OR WHEN DID I START LIKE THE WHOLE-?

YEAH. WHEN WAS YOUR- WHEN DID YOU START TRAINING?

UH, WE GOT OUR CLASS CHECKED INTO INTO CORONADO IN APRIL OF 2018.

OK.

THAT WAS MY FIRST CLASS WITH 337 ACTUALLY.

AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUD/S EXPERIENCE?

IT IS.

 (SIO): OK GREAT. SO I'M GOING TO ASK
    YOU ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. ARE YOU- DO YOU HAVE SIBLINGS?

I HAVE ONE SISTER.

OK, OLDER OR YOUNGER?

UH, YOUNGER, SHE'S TWO YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.

AND ARE YOU PARENTS MARRIED, SEPERATED, DIVORCED?

DIVORCED

WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO.

SO YOU WERE OLDER. YOU WERE IN HIGHSCHOOL?

ABOUT, I’D SAY I WAS A FRESHMAN OR SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

OK, HOW WAS THAT EXPERIENCE? WAS IT IMPACTFUL?

WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT DIVORCED, IT WASN'T A SURPRISE. WE KNEW IT WAS
COMING, WASN'T EASY AT FIRST, BUT, GOTTA GET USED TO IT.

HOW'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP, WITH YOUR PARENTS NOW?

DECENT. DECENT NOW.

WITH EACH? OR...?

YEAH, DECENT WITH BOTH.

OK. AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR SISTER?

GOOD. I TRY TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH AS MUCH AS I CAN.

 YEAH. WERE THERE ANY OTHER LIFE CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED
    IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?

UH, NOT REALLY. I MEAN, WE TRIED TO TRY TO JOIN THE NAVY WHEN I WAS 18
TO COME HERE, AND MY EYESIGHT WAS TOO POOR, SO I MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE.
IT SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT TIME. STARS ALIGNED AT THAT POINT. SO WHEN I
WAS 18 AND KEPT PURSUING THIS GOAL, AFTER I GOT LASIK EYE SURGERY.

OK. SO HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE YOU, TO GET THE SURGERY AND?

I GOT THE SURGERY IMMEDIATELY AFTER I WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR THE PROGRAM.
AND THEN I MOVED TO TEXAS TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT. AND AFTER THAT IT TOOK
ABOUT TWO YEARS TO GET CONTRACTED OUT.

AND WHAT DID YOU DO DURING THAT TIME?

I WORKED WITH A FRIEND WHO MOVED DOWN THERE, STARTED HIS OWN COMPANY. SO
HE STARTED GOING DOOR TO DOOR SALES WITH HIM. MOVED TO CORPORATE
SECURITY AFTER THAT.

INTERESTING. SO, DO YOU, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? AND THE OTHER MAJOR
EVENTS?

LIFE CHANGING? NOT PARTICULARLY.

ANY COLLEGE?

OH, YES. I WENT TO COLLEGE FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF. AND, UH, JUST I
KNEW I WAS GOING TO COME HERE. MY MOM ENCOURAGED COLLEGE BECAUSE SHE
WANTED ME TO GET MY DEGREE BEFORE I- IF I ENDED UP DOING THIS WHY NOT
MAKE IT COLLEGE PRIOR TO THIS? I COULDN'T STUDY, I WAS JUST BURNT OUT
FROM IT. I WASN'T HAVING A GOOD TIME OR IT DIDN'T SOME FUN AND EXCITING.
AND I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A MAJOR THAT I JUST COMMITTED TO. SO I JUST
DECIDED I'M JUST GOING TO ENLIST NOW... DO THAT LATER.

SO HOW DO ANY OF THESE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT
    BUD/S?

PRIOR EXPERIENCES? IF I WENT AT 18 I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD'VE MADE IT. I
WAS IMMATURE. LEARNED A LOT. I HAD A LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE, IN THOSE
TWO YEARS. SCREWED UP, BECAME WAY MORE INDEPENDENT. JUST UH, DEVOLVED...

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY AFFECTED YOUR PROGRESSION
    THROUGH BUD/S?

...UH, NOT ONE OF THE HIGHER PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES IN THE CLASS, BUT
BOYS, UH... FIND OUT. ALWAYS HAD A PERSONALITY THAT I FEEL LIKE IS JUST
TRYING TO HELP OUT. TRYING TO KIND OF HELP THE TEAM. I ALWAYS HAD A
TEAMMATE ATTITUDE. SO I THINK THAT HELPS AS WELL AS JUST BEING A DECENT
PERSON TO EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE, HOW THEY TREAT YOU. SO I
FEEL LIKE THAT HAS DEVELOPED ME THROUGH THAT'S DEFINITELY HELPED DEVELOP
ME THROUGH THIS PIPELINE AND ESSENTIALLY JUST KIND OF BUILDING THAT TEAM
WORK.

 OK. SO, YOU MENTIONED THIS DESIRE TO PURSUE THIS COMMUNITY. DO
    YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY OR FRIENDS THAT WERE SEALS? OR HOW DID YOU-
    WHAT REALLY GAVE YOU THAT SPARK, THAT INSPIRATION?

WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT JOINED THE MARINE
CORPS. I WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE, YET. THE
MILITARY WAS ALWAYS KIND OF IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD. AND WHEN THEY ALL
STARTED GOING TO THE MARINE CORPS, I UH, THAT WAS INITIALLY THE PLAN. I
WAS- MARINES WERE ALWAYS LIKE THE SUPERHERO. LIKE, "THOSE GUYS WERE THE
TOUGHEST DUDES AND STUDS. STARTED WORKING OUT WITH THEM. UH, DID SOME OF
THEIR PTS WITH THEIR LEADERS AND STUFF. I STARTED, UH, TRAINING IN MY
OWN TIME GETTING INTO SHAPE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF A PHYICAL LOW, BUT I GOT
INTO SHAPE AND I STARTED BECOMING ONE OF THE FASTEST RUNNERS. THEY
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS BEING CHALLENGED. SO I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING
MORE WISHFUL- MARINE RECON. AND UH, I WAS PURSUING THAT FOR A WHILE. AND
OUR FRIEND IN MY HOMETOWN SAID, "OH, I'M SAYING FOR THE SEALS". I MEAN
THERE WAS THIS OLD RETIRED SEAL GUY THAT TRAINS, AND "YOU SHOULD MEET
HIM." AND I MET HIM, AND THIS KIND OF ATTITUDE AND OUTLOOK ON LIFE, AND
HOW HUMBLE HE WAS MADE ME SWITCH. THE JOB ISN'T THAT MUCH DIFFERENT, BUT
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY ACTS, I WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

AND DID HE SERVE AS- THE ROLL OF OF MENTORING-.

YES. HE WAS ACTUALLY FROM THE START OF THE COMPANY DOWN IN TEXAS. I
MOVED DOWN THERE AND KIND OF ALWAYS... FOCUSED... LIKE HE WAS MY BOSS,
BUT HE ALSO HAD THAT UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE WOULD FOCUS ON
THIS.

 SO LETS TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, HOW WE
    DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? LIKE WHAT WAS THEIR PARENTING STYLE? DID
    THEY SPANK YOU, WAS IT FREE-RANGE PARENTING?

IT KIND OF DEPENDED. I WAS SOMEONE THAT HAD... PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT WAS
EVER LIKE... IF I REALLY. AS A YOUNGER CHILD, THAT WAS LIKE A STANDING,
BUT IT WAS NEVER LIKE A... AS I GOT OLDER. IT'S JUST LIKE, OKAY, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS. YOU DON'T GET YOUR PHONE OR...
PRIVALEDGES WERE- STUFF THAT DEFINITELY AS A KIND, SUCKED, BUT NOTHING
THAT WAS LIKE, CRAZY.

OK. AND DID YOU MOVE AROUND THROUGHOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD?

UH, I MOVED...

CAUSE YOUR PARENTS SEPARATED.

MY DAD, MY DAD AND WELL, I STAYED IN THE SAME HOUSE. SO I, UH, TILL I
CAME HERE.

OK. SO YOU DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO MOVE SCHOOLS, OR?

THE ONLY TIME I MOVED SCHOOLS WAS WHEN I MOVED FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER.
I WAS ABOUT... ABOUT 6TH GRADE. SO RIGHT WHEN I- ONE MOVED FROM WHEN I
WAS IN SIXTH GRADE FROM A PLACE 60 MILES AWAY, AND THAT WAS TOTALLY
FINE.

UH, SO, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. DID YOU PLAY A TEAM SPORT
    OR AN ACTIVITY WITH A TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY?

I PLAYED HOCKEY SINCE I WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD. JUST ON A COMPETITIVE
LEVEL- SO ICE HOCKEY AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. I
THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED IN OTHER SPORTS, BUT HOCKEY WAS MY FOCUS.

HOW MANY YEARS?

THE LAST TIME I PLAYED ON A TEAM WAS SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO 8
YEARS, TO WHAT, 18? MAYBE 10 YEARS OF COMPETITIVE PLAY.

OK, SO ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT A BIT, BUT FIVE YEARS BEFORE BUD/S, SO
YOU HAD TWO YEARS WORKING?

TWO, ROUGHLY TWO YEARS, YES.

TWO YEARS WORKING, THEN A YEAR AND A HALF OF COLLEGE?

YES. DURING THAT YEAR AND A HALF, I WAS GETTING REALLY FOCUSED ON...

OK AND BEFORE THAT WAS HIGH SCHOOL?

YES. A LOT OF THAT, PRETTY MUCH MOST OF THAT TIME I WAS FOCUSED ON.

YEAH. YEAH YOU WERE, TRAINING, FOR BUD/S, OK.

SIO AND THEN WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT IT IS.

OK, SO, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE, DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS THAT YOU GOT ON A
WHIM?

NO TATTOOS. I'M NOT PLANNING ON EVER GETTING TATTOOS.

SPEEDING TICKETS?

EEEEE, I HAVE ONE. I HAVE ONE SPEEDING TICKET BUT, I....

OK. DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, BIG SPENDING, DID YOU SEE A CAR AND BUY IT?

I DON'T BUY EXPENSIVE CARS, BUT I HAVE A TENDENCY TO COLLECT. LIKE, NOT
COLLECT CARS. BUT LIKE I HAVE A- I'M A BIG CAR GUY SO I'LL LIKE, AHHH
SEE LIKE THIS UNIQUE OR WEIRD CAR AND BE LIKE, "I REALLY WANT TO BUY
THAT THING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY UNIQUE AND RARE."

YOU DON'T- YOU'RE NOT IMPULSIVE AND...?

I JUST, I CAN'T, I WON'T BANKRUPT MYSELF. IT'S LIKE, IT'S LIKE, IN
PRINCETON, I BOUGHT A ILL-ADVISED.. IT'S AN ILL ADVISED DECISION BUT I
FOUND A CAR THAT MY DAD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OUR PROJECT FOR.

COOL.

SO I FOUND ONE, I FOUND, I'VE BEEN IN A FONTANA.

SO YOU RESEARCHED IT?

AND I THINK A WEEK AS I DROVE UP THERE. YEAH, I DO. I KNOW-

IT'S MORE OF A HOBBY.

IT IS. IT'S MORE OF A HOBBY, BUT IT'S KIND OF A OBSESSION I SUPPOSE.

SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT DECISION, RIGHT. YOU MAKE ANALYTICAL
DECISIONS WHERE YOU THINK THEM THROUGH AND DO RESEARCH AND PLAN, AND
METICULOUS THINKING.

IT'S VERY METICULOUS. IT'S... I MEAN, IF IT GETS IMPULSIVE IN THAT I
KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT, BUT IF SOMETHING POPS UP LIKE THE STARS ARE LIKE,
OKAY, SO THIS IS LIKE THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR A WHILE AND
I'LL SEE IT 20 MINUTES LATER AND I CAN BUY IT BUT LIKE IT'S USUALLY A
CASE DECISION....

 WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? SO, THIS
    COULD BE LIKE A DAY, OR AN EVENT... OR, UHHH, SOME GUYS SAY, LIKE,
    "LOGS", OR "WATER".

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY NARROW IT DOWN TO A SPECIFIC EVOLUTION. ALL
OF IT'S DIFFICULT. IT'S GETTING COLD. IT'S DEFINITELY A MENTAL
CHALLENGE. BUT IF THERE WERE NO RULES, I THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING PART
IS TO... ALWAYS, ALWAYS KEEP YOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE UP. NEVER LET THAT
NAGGING THOUGHT OF AM I DOING GOOD FOR IT? "AM I... AM I DOING WELL
ENOUGH FOR THE TEAM?" TO NOT CREEP IN, EVEN IF YOU'RE DOING PERFECTLY
FINE. THAT WAS SOMETHING I ALWAYS GET IN MY HEAD IS "AM I HURTING
PEOPLE?" I NEVER CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I WAS ALWAYS, I WAS ALWAYS
THINKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO HOLD ANYONE BACK, OR BE A
LIABILITY. SO THAT WAS ALWAYS KIND OF A TREAT ON MY MIND.

SO WHEN THOSE THOUGHTS WERE CREEPING IN, OR WHEN YOU GOT ROLLED, AND YOU
KINDA SAID LIKE "OHHH, IT LIKE, DO ALL THIS OVER AGAIN". HOW DID YOU-
WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH THAT CHALLENGE?

OH, THE DEDICATION TO WANTING TO BE HERE, I GUESS. I MEAN... SURE. I
MEAN, I KNOW I'M NOT ONE OF THE.... DIVISION ONE ATHLETES IN THE CLASS,
BUT UH... IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO HOW MUCH YOU WANT IT, HOW COMMITTED
YOU ARE TO BEING HERE. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. IF YOU WANTED TO DO- WELL
FOR MOST GUYS IT'S YOU WANT TO DO- HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT YOUR JOB, HOW
BADLY DO YOU WANT IT? SO IT'S REALLY JUST BOILS DOWN TO YOUR
SELF-CONFIDENCE AND SELF... YOUR DESIRE I GUESS TO BE PART OF AND
WILLING TO SERVE THIS COMMUNITY. SO I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE- IT'S
GOING TO THERE'S GOING TO BE HARDER TIMES, THAT WHAT WERE PUT THROUGH
HERE, SO THERE'S NEVER GOING TO GET EASIER. YOU KIND OF HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT ITS OUR JOB TO GET THROUGH THIS. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE WAY EASIER
THAN THE....

1DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES, LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL,
    THAT YOU USED TO PURSUE THE CHALLENGES?

A LOT OF SELF TALK.

YEAH? WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE? DID YOU HAVE ANY MANTRAS?

UH, NO. IT WASN'T A REALLY MATRAS, I NEVER EVEN REALLY ABOUT TRAINING. I
WOULD JUST KIND OF TALK TO MYSELF. IT TOOK ONE MIND OFF, WHATEVER WAS
REALLY HAPPENING, AND ESSENTIALLY FORGOT ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING
ON. AND LIKE, I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT, LIKE WHAT I WAS, "OH, MY CAR'S
BROKEN DOWN." WHAT I TO DO TO IT THIS WEEKEND, I THOUGHT THROUGH- LIKE I
SAID, I NEED TO WORK ON THIS PART, WORK ON THAT. SO I WAS KINDA, I
ALWAYS KINDA MENTALLY JUST, ESPECIALLY DURING THE MORE CHALLENGING "NOT
THIS" EVOLUTIONS, TOOK MY MIND OUT OF IT AND PUT IT SOMEPLACE ELSE. SO
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS, "OH, WOW YEAH, TRAINING."

UH, THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING CAUSE SOME GUYS WILL SAY THAT THEY,
INSTEAD HAD DEVELOPED THIS INTENSE FOCUS. RIGHT, LIKE, THIS IS WHERE I
AM, THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING. BUT YOU ACTUALLY, REMOVED YOURSELF.

YEAH. AND IT DEPENDS. SO LIKE THEY WERE- IN THE EVOLUTION THAT REQUIRED
FOCUS, BY, FOR INSTANCE, IN THIRD PHASE, WHEN WERE DOING IADS, I'D SAY
THAT IT'S DEFINITELY MORE OF A, FOCUS MODE, BUT IF IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE
A TWO AND A HALF MILE SWIM THAT WAS LIKE EXTREMELY LONG. I WOULD JUST,
START THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND JUST COMPLETELY FORGET ABOUT THE
SWIMMING PORTION SO, THAT AUTOPILOT, I FEEL LIKE THAT HELPED, HAD THEY
TALKED ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT...

1UH, WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING AT
    BUD/S, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? UH,
    AND IS THERE A DECISION THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH AT BUD/S.

DIFFICULT DECISIONS? SUCH AS?

FOR EXAMPLE, RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT OR TURNING IN A CHEATING CLASSMATE
OR THE DECISION TO GO TO MEDICAL, EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT GET
ROLLED.

THAT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION WAS DEFINITELY MEDICAL, I GOT ROLLED IN
SECOND BASE. IT'S OKAY, ESPECIALLY AFTER I WAS WELL, THE FIRST TIME
THOSE NAGGING ME ON MY HEAD BUT LIKE, "OH I MIGHT GET DROPPED FOR
THIS.".

SO WHY DID YOU DO IT?

I KNEW IF I HAD CONTINUED, IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY
DANGEROUS TO MY HEALTH IF I HADN'T GONE. I COULD'VE, ESSENTIALLY LIKE,
LIKE EXTREME RISK FOR ...

So, uh.

Yes, it's OK to record me. I'm participant number 359

359, OK. Trying to figure out the best way, to set this up.

Yeah, no worries.

Sorry, I'm on East Coast time and like, what time is it? hahaha.

Yeah.

It's not 10 o'clock haha.

Hahaha yeah.

Awful enough haha. So easy questions to start with. When did you start
um BUDS? Where you with three three nine?

I was with 337 so.

Ok.

So it was uh May of last year.

Ok, so May of 2019?

Yes.

And had you ever tried to do BUDS prior to that?

Nope.

This is your first.

First time.

First time. OK. And then where are you kind of coming from?

Um from Boston.

Ok.

Uhh and I went to Tufts University.

Ok.

I played college sports there.

Ok.

Uh is that what you mean by that?

Yeah. Yeah. So. So were you. Did you do OCS?

Yes, I'm an officer.

OK.

I went to OCS

OK, and is this kind of your your first things you did OCS then you came
straight To BUDS.

Yes.

Ok, so easy questions to start with. How many siblings do you have?

A younger sister.

A younger sister, Ok. how much younger?

Um she is two and a half years older.

OK. And then what was your kind of parents parental situation growing
up? Two parent households.

Two parent household.

During the whole time growing up.

Yep.

And your first...see you answered my question and got me even asking.

There ya go, that's good

Um and how's your relationship with your parents?

Good, really good.

And has it always been that way.

Yes. Very much so um growing up we were in Massachussetts.

Ok.

There were times where my parents were like just focus on
(intelligible)?

Yeah. OK.

That was for a couple years.

Yeah.

I had a great relationship with my parents. I consider my upbringing
normal but I think but I think to most people it's not normal.

Yeah. Yeah. Do you think what kind of years of your childhood was she
sick.

Um she was basically sick until my 13th birthday.

OK.

The first 13 years of my life.

Yeah.

That was a lot for her.

Yeah.

Going through that but yeah, also like it changed the dynamic going
through that.

Yeah absolutely it changes the dynamic.

Absolutely.

At home and everything.

Absolutely.

Do you think that kind of situation shaped kind of your viewpoint on
life? When you are.

Honestly probably but it's hard to say because I I thought it was
normal.

Yeah.

I thought it was like everyone's life but it wasn't so yes, yes ma'am
but I don't know.

Yeah. No. Makes sense. That's a good answer. What kind of life changing
experiences or events happened your life prior to coming to BUDS.

Um nothing crazy.

Yeah.

I had a very normal upbringing in life but I mean life changing could be
considered college I went to private high school.

Yeah.

I was considered successful. I won national championships and state
championships I think that to me was life changing and I was on some
great teams as well.

Yeah.

I consider to be life changing as well.

What sport was that again?

I played football and lacrosse in college.

Ok.

And growing up.

Ok, so and so you played them both in college.

Yes.

That's great. That's not that common right?

No.

Hahaha That's kind of intense.

Yeah it was fun though.

Now, tell me a little bit about kind of your experience being on sports.
Like what what what's great about it? What wasn't great about it?

Uh I love the team team aspects I love winning. I like the
competitiveness and the common goals everyone on that team is working
together for a common goal.

Yeah.

Things you don't like about it? Um I think it's like anything like if
you have uh (intelligible), you learn a lot.

Yeah.

You have bad people on the team you need to get rid of them and you have
to figure out how to get that team to be successful without being
distracted.

Yeah.

I feel like all of it is positive if I'm being honest, I don't find many
negatives.

How did kind of your experiences, whether in sports or whether they were
just growing up, contributed to your experience here at BUDS?

Um, I think I was able to draw a lot from a lot of drills from lacross
in college and in football in college.

Yeah.

(intelligible) To BUDS. And nothing seemed to me like , Ok I always have
something to fall back on.

Yeah.

And uh, previous experience or draw from like if I made some mistakes, I
could just think back to lacrosse ok this is what we did in this
situation. This is how it should be. I think it could be very helpful.

Yeah. Do you have a specific example for all that?

Sure. Like something that we used to say in lacrosse was like one more.
So that can stem from anything from being one more rep in the weight to
one more rep in practice to just focus on the next game and I used that
in Hell Week all the time to be like hey I'm just going to do one more
push up or.

Yeah.

Or one more bed check and it was something I didn't need to do it, but
it was just like wanting to remind myself.

Yeah.

Remind me of my buddies back home and it just made things not be as bad.

Makes sense, what about your personality? How do you think it
contributes to progression for BUDS.

Yeah. I think uh I can take a lot.

Yeah.

And uh adapt and will to change and my ego is not too big going to get
in the way of anyone. I think that was really helpful. And I think
ultimately I got to be able to laugh in the face of adversity or pain
and just use humor all the time.

How would you describe your personality in general?

I'm an outgoing, caring person. And a leader

So what in your background led you to want to pursue SEALs?

Um honestly I just knew I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a firefighter
in the community until I was like five and this was pre 9/11. I was like
yeah this is what I want to do.

Any like family members, military, anything like.

My dad was a helicopter pilot.

Ok. Was he active duty growing up?

Yes, yes. Or no, sorry he was active duty before.

Before?

Yeah.

OK. Did you move around a lot when you were younger?

No, I was always in Boston.

Ok, What about, I know this kind of seems strange, but they build into
all of this how about as a child? How are you disciplined? What was
discipline like?

I parents were really strict, they ran a tight household. Not as bad as
helicopter, but they were just around me.

Yeah.

Depending on what you did, you'd have to like write an apology or do
pushups or something that.

So in general, with, like, discipline, was there a spanking or was it
more like, OK, push ups or timeout or.

Um, more like timeout or take something away?

Ok.

Restriction.

We asked about it and moved around a lot as a child. So did you always
live in Boston? Never kind of.

Yeah I was in the Boston area.

Now but you did say you spent some time with your cousins growing up
when your sister was sick. Was that the same area?

Yeah. So we lived in different towns at the time but because I'd go over
there so much more we ultimately moved to their town.

OK.

So it became like an even shorter commute.

Yeah. And then how was that living? Like, how long did you live with
them or was it just short burst of time?

Um, it varied like sometimes I wake up in my house and then I'd wake up
in their.

Yeah.

Or I'd start to go to bed in my house then go to their house but
sometimes it would be like a week or more.

Yeah.

But to me it was a normal.

Yeah.

I just thought it was what people did.

Hahaha just part of life. It's amazing what child is like. Oh like how
you know you don't really realize those things.

No, you don't, it seems normal.

But it is, um. What about teenage years? So you talk about you
participated in sports. Um anything else that you did besides sports?

Um I was. I was always a part of student council.

OK.

Or like anything with leadership rolls.

And um so with sports, I mean how you talked again a little bit about
how you think it played in to being here. But um, anything else that
kind of you see a link between the sports that you played being here
like any other contributors.

Um I think education levels.

Yeah.

I think that the majority of the dudes here have a college degree. I
mean obviously have like four or five, 18 to 20 year olds.

Yeah.

] And one of them his dad is a SEAL also, I think just by virtue of want
to read his chances of being successful in htis program are a lot
higher.

Yeah.

And the other three or four dudes are just really tough.

Yeah.

So I think education, if you want successful you need to be educated.

What do you think it is about education that lets you to be successful?

That's a good question. I think it's more like perspective on what
you're doing.

Yeah.

And you can kind of you don't think about selfishly about yourself but
you can also think of others. And I think you can just take a little bit
more

So what did you do in the last five years to kind of prior to becoming
coming to BUDS.

Um once I graduated from college, I took a little time off and I worked.

Ok. What? What did you work?

I worked for the Kraft Group. I was doing data analytics.

OK. Interesting.

Yeah. Very normal, I, I uh, very hard for me. It wasn't my first choice.

Is that like a desk job? Right.

Desk job.

OK. Interesting.

It's the New England Patriots, essentially.

Ok and so was that kind of like your plan or were you always thinking
SEALs?

No, I knew I wanted to do this. I took that job and I talked to the CO,
and said hey, look, I'm going to come to BUDS.

Yeah.

It's more of a matter of time. I'd really like to work and get some
experience just doing something else in the meantime.

Yeah.

He was like sure, come on board. He like put me in this role. He's like
I know you don't have any experience doing this more challenging for
you, but like I figure it out you'll be fine.

Yeah. How long do you do that?

I think it was like 10 months.

Ok.

It was a little bit of time

Ok, and then training wise, I mean, were you physically training what
types of training were you doing outside?

I was working out like three times a day I work. I'd workout at lunch.
And then I would go in the afternoons and work out again.

Mkk.

With my friends for like three, four hours. But in the mornings, my
commute was like an hour and a half each way.

Ok.

It was really bad. So in the morninng I couldn't really do much

I got I got that commute right now.

Yeah seriously.

Haha. So would you consider yourself impulsive at all?

No. I mean, I'm definitely like I get excited when I make decisions.

Yeah.

I say like let's go. Maybe I don't formulate a plan all the time, like
beforehand. Like a comprehensive plan.

Yeah.

And maybe I like to figure things out on the fly sometimes, but other
than that I think big decsions through a good amount.

Ok. What about do you have any tattoos or anything like speed, lots of
speeding tickets. Anything that would indicate. I know we have these
strange questions thrown in there.

I figured that question was coming.

How does that fit? Hahaha. What about what do you think the most
challenging component of BUDS was?

Um personally or what do I think in general.

Personally.

I failed pool comp my first time.

Ok.

And it was challenging because I thought I was comfortable in the water.

Yeah.

But I had to get into like another level of comfortability and for me
that was just relaxing. I feel like in this program you're taught to
really very upright, very hard, but and that instances like hey you just
need to relax, like hey you're completely fine just calm down and that's
hard for me to like just chill out.

So was there anything you did specifically to kinc of try to calm your
mind, learn to relax.

I used visualization.

Ok.

Uh Mags teaches us here like visualization arousal control uh goal
setting, self talk and I just used all of those tools.

Yeah.

That we learned.

What. What kind of motivated you to push through that that challenge?
When you failed pool comp.

I hated failing and I was embarrassed.

Yeah.

More so embarrassed.

So that was it. Because you said you came in three seven.

I got rolled medically.

OK. Um and did you feel like you were supported by the group when you
failed pool comp?

Oh, definitely.

Yeah.

Yeah well, all they dudes are really helpful and encouraging. How can we
help you? Sounds cool to see.

Ok. Um we talked a little bit about kind of some of the practices you
did. But anything else like whether it's physical, mental, spiritual
that you think helped push you through challenges?

Um yeah. One thing you can practice the diving on the grinder. They call
it dirt diving.

Yeah.

They have like PVC pipes, tanks you can use. Any time you can walk
through stuff like that.

Yeah.

You're getting dry runs it was really helpful even like with pistol qual
or rifle qual or practicing that trigger pull was really helpful on the
island.

Um what about was there a time you had to make a difficult decision
during training here?

Um, I mean, again, that was all training.

Yeah.

So I think anything too too challenging that we had to face certainly
its organized chaos but I wouldn't say anything too too crazy

Was there any, like, cheating that you observed or like a classmate
something? you kinda had to.

Yeah, there was a kid in my original class after Hell Week we decided he
couldn't get up on the obsticals.

Yeah.

And he decided to go around. And then worded in that he passed but
everone in the class saw.

Yeah.

He was a really well liked kid, a really good performer and we
eventually turned him in.

Yeah.

And said hey cheater. And they eventually dropped him.

What. What kind of helped make that decision as a group? Was it somebody
really pushing the.

For me it was a no brainer, he had to go.

Yeah.

I was like hey he's a scumbag I don't want him. But like other guys were
like no, he's done really well we should keep him it was like a one time
mistake. But it was more so challenging arguing that against different
peoples moral ethics.

Um what about. Why do you think you were successful completing BUDS?

Uh I think I was just really dug in and focused on it but I think
there's a good amount of luck that's also involved. I think I had, like
other people would say that I'm am lucky cause I had two rolls.

Yeah.

I had a med roll and a performance issue. Other guys just go, right
though it.

Yeah.

If you can do it right away on one shot like that's a good roulette
game.

Yeah.

That means you're healthy.

Yeah.

Rolling to a roll.

It wasn't freezing cold like it's been recently.

Yes, exactly.

Anything that you think is different about you? The fact that you got
through it, and people haven't gone through it.

think I don't know how you can quantify it. I think, you know prior
coming to BUDS whether or not you're going to be successful.

And why, what what do you think it is.

I just knew growing up. I was. I knew I was going to graduate and I
knew. It was never an issue. It was more so like do I really wanted to
do this.

Ok.

Do I want to subject myself to all of this misery and do I want this to
be my lifestyle. That was the question.

Got it.

It wasn't oh I'm wondering if I can make it through, and I don't mean to
sound cocky or anything, but I think everyone in this room knew that.
That they knew that they were gonna make it through.

There's a there's a level of confidence.

Absolutely.

Um, how has this changed you as a person?

Um, I think it gives you confidence.

Yeah.

But it's also like your opportunities and potentials untapped. You're
never in question. You can literally do anything that you want. Which is
cool. Like I've been compared to my other friends and they're like, I
think you have superpowers.

Hahaha you're not the first person that says that.

Oh really.

Yeah, it's interesting, you know, but I think that's a good thing I
don't think it's a bad thing cause you kinda need it for what you're
going to do.

Oh absolutely.

You kinda have to have that mindset. So uh anything else I should have
asked that might contribute to our study.

I include uh well I don't know if it would help but what I would ask if
like guys think that they've made like knew they were going to make it
through.

Yeah.

I think that would be very interesting. I think the guys of asked on the
handful are like yeah I didn't really know if I'm going to make it going
into Hell Week.

That are still here today.

Yes, but I think that ulitmately that everyone knew that they were gonna
make it through.

Yeah.

That would be the only question.

Ok, great. OK, well, I'm finished. I'm gonna collect your card.

WHAT’S YOUR PARTICIPANT ID?

378

AND THEN, DO YOU MIND IF I RECORD YOU?

NO.

OKAY GREAT. SO WHEN DID YOU START BUDS AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST BUDS
EXPERIENCE?

SO, SHOWED UP LAST APRIL. STARTED WITH CLASS 337 AND UH YEAH THIS IS MY
FIRST BUDS EXPERIENCE.

AND HOW MANY, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU
HAVE AND WHAT’S THE BIRTH ORDER?

I’VE GOT TWO YOUNGER SIBLINGS. I’M THE OLDEST.

AND ARE THEY GIRLS, BOYS?

GIRLS. 21 AND 18. AND I AM 24.

AND WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED, DIVORCED?

THEY’RE MARRIED.

AND WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THEM?

I’M SUPER CLOSE WITH MY PARENTS. I’D SAY MORE SO NOW THAN WHEN I WAS
YOUNGER, BUT UM YEAH JUST HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

GOOD. DID YOU HAVE ANY LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCES PRIOR TO BUDS? WHAT YOU
CONSIDER LIFE CHANGING IS WHATEVER I MEAN BY LIFE CHANGING. LIKE SOME
PEOPLE SAY NO AND OTHER PEOPLE SAY LIKE FIVE THINGS.

I DON’T REALLY KNOW IF ONE THING PER SAY WAS LIFE CHANGING. I THINK A
LOT OF THINGS CULMINATED IN SMALLER CHANGES THAT HAPPENED OVER TIME. BUT
IT WASN’T ANY ONE THING SPECIFICALLY.

HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR PROGRESSION
THROUGH BUD/S?

I THINK THAT I’VE WANTED TO DO THIS MY ENTIRE LIFE SO ITS LIKE A LITTLE
BIT EASIER TO LOOK AT THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE AND UH I THINK IN TERMS OF
MY PERSONALITY IN TERMS OF WHO I AM AND WHO I KNOW MYSELF TO BE I AM
VERY CONFIDENT. I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I WASN’T GOING TO HAVE TOO MANY
PROBLEMS COMING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. UM YEAH.

WHAT MADE YOU EVEN WANT TO BE A SEAL LIKE DO YOU HAVE MILITARY IN YOUR
FAMILY OR SEALS THAT YOU KNOW?

SO MY GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE NAVY. HE WAS A CORPSMAN DURING WWII. BUT
THAT WAS ABOUT IT UH. I THINK WHAT LED ME TO THIS WAS, UH TOOK A, UH, A
NOVIANCE TEST WE TOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL TO SEE WHAT WORKED BEST FOR US, AND
I GOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. MY UNCLE WAS A FEDERAL MARSHALL AND WAS TALKING
TO HIM ABOUT IT, AND HE SAID IT'S REALLY HARD TO COME FROM. I’M FROM
MASSACHUSETTS AND THE WAY THE POLICING WORKS THERE IN THE CITY IS THAT
ALL THE VETERANS PRIORITY FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GO TO THE ACADEMY. I
COULD GO BE IN THE MILITARY FOR A LITTLE BIT. AND FROM THERE I DECIDED
IF I WAS GOING TO JOIN, I WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT HAD A BIG
IMPACT ON THE WORLD, SO.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? WOULD
YOU SAY YOUR PARENTS SPANKED YOU, TIMEOUTS, WITHHELD TOYS, PHYSICAL
STUFF?

DEFINITELY, TIMEOUTS. GO TO YOUR ROOM AND YOU’LL BE IN THERE FOR A BIT.
NOTHING PHYSICAL EVER REALLY. IT WAS JUST KIND OF THINGS BEING WITHHELD
AND BEING ALONE IT WASN'T ANYTHING SUPER CRAZY.

DID YOU MOVE AROUND A LOT?

NO.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? DID YOU DO ANY SPORTS? ANYTHING
INDIVIDUALLY? WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID YOU DO?

I WAS BIG INTO PLAYING FOOTBALL WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. UM, WHEN I WAS REAL
LITTLE, BUT DIDN’T PLAY IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DID WRESTLING AND JIU-JITSU IN
HIGH SCHOOL. PLAYED BASEBALL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

SO WERE UH EITHER OF THOSE A PARTICULARLY TIGHT KNIT GROUP?

NOT SO MUCH WITH THOSE TEAMS NO. LIKE WE WERE ALL CLOSE WITH EACH OTHER
BUT NOT IN THE SAME MANNER AS LIKE IT IS HERE I GUESS.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S
TRAINING?

UH, WENT TO COLLEGE. WENT TO BOSTON UNIVERSITY. UM AND A STUDENT AND
GRADUATED IN DECEMBER OF. I GUESS JANUARY OF 2018.

WERE YOU ROTC OR ANYTHING?

I WAS IN A FRATERNITY, BUT THAT WAS IT. I PLAYED ON THE RUGBY TEAM FOR A
YEAR AND THAT GROUP WAS REALLY CLOSE. BUT

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE? FOR EXAMPLE, SOME PEOPLE GET
TATTOOS IMPULSIVELY?

NO, I DON’T THINK I AM IMPULSIVE. MAYBE LIKE A LITTLE BIT BUT NOTHING
LIKE BIG DECISIONS AND WHAT NOT JUST KIND OF SMALLER STUFF.

WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? THINK ABOUT YOUR
HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S. WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH? DID YOU
FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

GETTING ROLLED OUT OF 338 WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST PROBABLY BECAUSE IT
WASN’T ANYTHING THAT I DID OR THE OTHER SIX GUYS. IT WAS THAT THEY
DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT FOR US TO CONTINUE WITH THE CLASS. SO THEY
JUST KIND OF PULLED SEVEN GUYS AND TOLD US TO TAKE A SEAT. SO THAT WAS
REALLY HARD. I THINK THE GUYS THAT I GOT ROLLED WITH I’M NOW SUPER CLOSE
WITH WHICH IS AWESOME BUT DEFINITELY THE GUYS I WAS AROUND HELPED OUT A
LOT AND I GUESS THE OTHER PART OF THAT WAS TALKING TO MY PARENTS,
TALKING TO MY MOM. SHE SAID YOU KNOW EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
THAT’S THE DEAL. I KIND OF JUST LOOKED AT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL
UP AND REST AND GET READY TO KEEP ON GOING BUT THAT WAS DEFINITELY
PROBABLY THE HARDEST.

DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES THAT HELPED YOU GET THROUGH LIKE PHYSICAL,
MENTAL, SPIRITUAL STUFF? ROUTINES THAT YOU DID.

UM, I THINK JUST HAVING LIKE TIME TO MYSELF TO SORT OF THINK AND KIND OF
MEDITATE I GUESS ON EVERYTHING. THERE WERE CERTAIN WEEKENDS HERE ON 618
I WOULD GO TO CORONADO AND GET A CUP OF COFFEE ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY
MORNING AND FACETIME MY PARENTS. I THINK THAT WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT
HELPED. DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I HAVE DONE EVER SINCE I GOT HERE.
OUTSIDE OF THAT NOTHING.

YOU MUST HAVE SOME VERY SUPPORTIVE PARENTS. THAT’S ALL I’M SAYING AS A
PARENT. YEAH, THAT’S HARD. WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING
TRAINING AT BUD/S, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT
DECISION? SOME PEOPLE SAID THEY HAVEN’T MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION AND IF
YOU HAVEN’T THAT’S FINE TOO.

YEAH, I HAVEN’T REALLY HAD ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS.

WHY DO YOU THINK MADE YOU COMPLETING SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S? IF
I AM TRYING TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE TRYING TO GO INTO BUDS, WHAT SHOULD I
LOOK FOR? WHAT MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL?

I THINK, UH, THE LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS THEY ARE ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND
HOW COMMITTED THEY ARE TO IT I THINK IF PEOPLE ARE… IF PEOPLE LIKE THE
IDEA OF BEING A SEAL OR GOING THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, THEY LIKE THAT, THEY
DON’T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRAINING IS GOING TO BE. THEY
DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW STRESSING IT IS AND HOW TAXING IT IS ON YOURSELF
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY. UM, YEAH.

SO, DID YOU NOTICE THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T MAKE IT, LOOKING AROUND THIS
ROOM, ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE IT? IF YOU COULD
SAY OH YEAH THEY’RE THIS, THEY AREN’T GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH?

AH, I DON’T KNOW IF ANYTHING DEFINITIVELY COULD. I THINK THERE ARE,
THERE WAS UH, GUYS YOU TALK TO THEM THAT THEY DIDN’T SEEM AS COMMITTED.
TALKING ABOUT DURING FIRST PHASE ON THE WEEKEND, COULD SEE SOME GUYS
JUST REALLY INSIDE THEMSELVES THINKING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THEN
LATER ON THAT NEXT WEEK, THEY WOULD QUIT. SO I THINK UH, DEFINITELY.

SO DO YOU MEAN THEY WERE GOING OUT AND PARTYING AND NOT TAKING IT
SERIOUSLY OR THEY WERE PSYCHING THEMSELVES OUT?

THEY WERE PSYCHING THEMSELVES OUT. JUST REALLY SECOND GUESSING WHAT THE
PROGRAM WAS.

HOW DID DO YOU THINK THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

I AM DEFINITELY MORE CONFIDENT IN MYSELF AND MY ABILITIES. UM, THAT’S
DEFINITELY THE BIG ONE. UH, I THINK I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DECENT AT
COMMUNICATING AND THIS PROGRAM MADE ME EVEN BETTER AT COMMUNICATING. UM,
DEALING WITH ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE IS ANOTHER BIG THING THAT I’VE LEARNED
A LOT AND GROWN. UM YEAH.

AND ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU TO HELP US GET, SO THE NAVY IS
HAVING US DO THIS SO THAT THEY CAN PICK BETTER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
COMING INTO BUDS? IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU? OF COURSE
IT TAKES THIS

I DONT REALLY THINK SO

NO WORRIES. WE JUST FINISH UP WITH THAT JUST IN CASE. THAT WAS
PERFECT. THANK YOU.

ABOUT THAT AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S FINE TOO

YEAH I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

okay why do you think you were so successful at completing
BUDS?

. Determination

mhm lemme ask it a different way there are a lot of people
that were in your class who aren't here today what made them different
than you

.yes um sometimes it wasn't even their choice you know they
maybe failed a test and thats why theyre not here um other than that
like during the harder stuff they quit maybe they haven't gone through
pain or such a severe as challenging obstacle

AHUH DO YOU THINK THIS WHOLE BUDS EXPERIENCE HAS CHANGED YOU
AS A PERSON?

YES DEFINITELY

in what way

UM JUST DURING THROUGH THE TRAINING I CAN SEE THE UM WHAT
STRESS CAN DO TO YOU AND LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT STRESS AND
LEARNING HOW TO WORK WITH A TEAM TO GET THROUGH CHALLENGES BUT YOU DON'T
YOU'RE NOT EXPOSED TO STRESS OR YOU'RE NOT EXPECTED TO PERFORM UNDER
STRESS IN THE CIVILIAN WORLD SO THAT THAT REALLY

not like this

.not like this yeah

Okay so the navy hired us to try to figure out what makes
people successful when they come to buds and try to learn a little more
about that before they select people for BUDS what should i have asked
you that i didn't ask you that might help us figure that out?

ID SAY YOU ASKED EVERYTHING

okay

YOU ASKED ABOUT LIFE EXPERIENCES BEFORE THAT MIGHT HAVE
HELPED ME

okay

YEAH .

okay

So is it ok if I record

Yes Ma’am

And what’s your participant number?

Uhh 381

And you were 66?

I was

Ok, perfect

I was originally 69 (unintelligible)

69, alright…Ok, soooo…this…looks like you have a split personality…so
uh, easy question to start with. When did you start BUDS, and uh what
was your first class

I started BUDS June 10^(th) 2019 with class…uh three...338

Ok and then when did you kinda get rolled how did you get in class
three…

I got rolled for OC-5 in second phase with 338

Ok um…and then um…had you ever tried BUDS before? Is this your first
time?

This is my first time.

Uh how many siblings do you have?

I have one older sister, she’s 28

Ok and how much older than you is that

I’m 25 so shes three years older.

Ok…What about your parent situation? Do you have a two parent household?

No my parents were high school sweethearts and have been married for 35
years.

Ok so they were together the whole time?

The whole time

Um are you close with your parents?

I actually talk to them everyday…probably the closest family in the
United States

Hahahaha…Um…How do you think that has factored into who you are as a
person?

Oh it definitely has. I had the best childhood growing up. We did
everything as a family. LSU football games on Saturday, church on Sunday
morning, watch the Saints and the Cowboys on Sunday afternoon

And did you grow up in one place? Did you move around a lot?

Yep yeah I grew up in the same house

Ok. Where did you grow up?

Lafayette, Louisiana

Ok, um, anything life changing like in your life that happened prior
coming to BUDS?

Yeah so I was playing professional baseball in uh Colombia South America

Ok

And got ss...ate some bad food and got really sick and uh had to go to
the hospital and ever since then I’ve lost sight and ever since then it
was the last time I picked up a baseball

Oh wow

Um and then I just remember coming home from there and I always, I
always wanted to become

a SEAL. I thought baseball was my purpose, I wanted to go Major Leagues.

Yeah.

No jobs, whole nine yards. I remember my dad picked me up from Louis uh
International Airport in New Orleans and I said I’m done with baseball,
I wanna be a Navy SEAL

Ok, so what was the timeframe?

That was in um November of 2017

Ok…So what were you doing prior to that?

Finishing school

Ok

I had um four classes left so it took the next semesters to do that
online, and then I started

training for 6 months

Uh huh

And that’s when they shipped me out in February of 2019

Ok. And then um how do you think that experience of kinda trying to play
professional baseball had shaped your experience here?

It absolutely had…I had…I felt like I had the mental, baseballs all
mental, its physical but mostly a game of nowadays what kind of
mentality you have. And I feel like…you know…you have three, if you hit
three (intelligible) you’re a hall of famer, so failure is part of the
game.

Yeah

So I feel like that helped me…constantly…constantly learning how to
fail, and accepting failure, and always trying to succeed and learning
how to succeed as well shaped me well to come to BUDS

Yeah…um…could you describe your personality and how you think that
contributed to your experience here.

Very, very high energetic

Ok

Um sometimes emotional roller coaster but for the most part very
positive um love. I have too much energy.

Haha. Was that a good thing here?

Yes

Um in what way? Can you give me an example?

Um for staying positive like always finding humor

Yeah

In uh the worst situations possible in Hell Week, getting gassed on the
island in third phase just always, you know, having that high energy to
motivate the guys around me

Yeah…what are the um what made you, you kinda wanna be a SEAL?

Um I’ve always loved training for anything I love having a purpose and a
goal, and baseball was just not meeting that, and of course reading the
books, and you know, watching the movies, and doing more research, and
actually understanding the training, and making that commitment, is the
most purpose I have ever, I’ve ever had in my life

Yeah anybody military family at all?

Yeah my dad was in the Army for four years, but

Uh-huh, was that prior to you being around

That was when he was right out of high school, yes ma’am

Any friends that are military?

(intelligible)

So um tell me a little bit more about your childhood. Um like what was
discipline kinda like in your household

Um, you know, grew up in the south yes ma’am no ma’am, got spankings
until I was like 10 or 12, you know

Yeah

Um, aaaa my parents were, uhh I wouldn’t say they were like strict ya
know, but as far as they kinda like let me figure out

Yeah

Figure out whats right whats wrong

Ummm, what about, I think I asked this, but did you move around a lot
during your childhood?

No.

Always stay around Louisiana?

Same house, 2217 (unintelligible) Road.

Hahaha

Hahaha. Louisiana.

We’ll take that outta there, hahaha, do you like Louisiana?

Love it.

Yeah.

Love it. I planned to live there when I retire, don’t know when that
will be but…

Go back there

Yeah, as soon as possible.

Umm..what about your teenage years, tell me a little bit about them,
tell me about baseball

I went to a private school, catholic school, um in high school, and
played football and baseball and um excelled in baseball, not too good
at football, really excelled in baseball, um and just you know every
Saturday morning before the LSU games my dad would go hit, you know work
on my craft, something like that um. Yeah just you know, normal high
school athletic life,

Yeah

Inner lifestyle. That’s it, yeah

Um what about any, you talked a little bit about um kinda uh uh playing
professional baseball a little bit. Anything else in the last 5 years,
you said you were finishing college

Yes I went to the University of Arizona

Ok

Played baseball there, and then uh…finished my last year at Troy
University, which is where I got my degree from.

Umm… and you did that after you came back into?

I was taking online classes and giving baseball lessons during that time
period

Ok. And where is, where is Troy University?

Alabama.

Ok. So, you taught baseball, did that, anything else that you did that
you were kinda like were you im going, what were you doing to prep?

Uhh.. running, swimming, lifting

Mkk. Anything you were doing mentally to prepare?

Uhhh yeah, I listen to this app called HeadSpace.

Okay.

I’ve always done it during my baseball career. I absolutely love it.
But, other than that, that was it. And then obviously the workouts,
which were mentally challenging.

Yeah. Were you working out with other people

Yeah so one of my buddies from back home, uh he’s a fire, a fire
fighter, um loved the training aspect of it

Yeah

So we just got after it, kinda held each other accountable

Mkk. Um. Would you consider yourself impulsive at all?

To a certain extent. I mean everyone is impulsive

So could you describe some of your impulsive behaviors?

Uhhh…I don’t know. As far as the training, or just in life?

In life

Can you give me an example?

Umm like do you have tattoos?

Oh, no tattoos.

No tattoos, any like, made any big purchases on a whim?

Uh I bought a dirt bike *snaps fingers* just like that

Do you have, like have you ridden bikes before?

Yes growing up

Ok. Um what about lots of speeding tickets, anything like that?

Uh, yes I have about 4 to 5 speeding tickets

Were they in a short time frame or were they over a year or so

Literally innnn probably two months (inaudible) all the sudden

Be careful, haha

That was 2017, haha

Hahaha, wow, hahaha um um what was, what do you think the most
challenging component of

BUDS was

Ah well I got rolled in um OC-5, uh, that was the first time, I have
never felt anything and I

swear on my lung nothing in BUDS compared to OC-5 and I failed it three
times in a row

Oh

Three attempts then I got rolled

And what’s OC-5?

OC-5 is um buddy um ditch and dawn your gear underwater

Ok, ok

I had three little procedures messed up and that was the best thing that
has ever happened to me

before

Well why is that

Because I absolutely love this class it kinda humbled me a little bit I
mean I was passing the

former (intelligible) I got rolled and it was kinda getting to love
these guys, I wouldn’t change it for the world

Yeah so do you um, what kind of motivated you to kinda have that
experience?

Um, well one you’re here for a goal and I’ll do whatever it takes to
accomplish a goal, and two its just, you know, I feel like, when, again,
playing baseball learning how to fail, it’s just a part of it, part of
the process.

Um, when you got rolled into this class you said it was good, good to
know them as people, was there was there support from the group? Talk to
me a little bit about the group dynamic

Yeah so half this class was 338

Ok

If you haven’t noticed, theres probably like 20 of us, and this class
had like 59 that are in 338 so having that part of group of friends come
in and is just kinda you know 59 originals coming in is a small group so
its very easy to mesh

Yeah. Um any practices whether they are physical, mental, spiritual that
you utilized to get through in general or any specific challenging
moments here?

Um, I feel like when we got gassed on the island that was a mental stay
in it, stay in the fight, stay in the fight, other than that it was just
you take something and you just do it

Now um on that was that like kind of as a group you were doing that or
was that more in your own head that you were kinda saying stay in it

That was that was something I feel like that is all individual

Yeah

I mean as a group, we got grouped, we got gassed as a group as a class,
but as far as individual I feel like everybody had their own mental
fight

To get through?

It was the worst

Yeah.

It was the worst evolution in BUDS

Yeah

By far

Haha, it’s over, haha

It was simulated death

Um, was there any time you had to make a difficult decision during
training at BUDS like whether it was for you personally a moral or
ethical decision or seeing someone else making the wrong decision and
then you had to decide do I say something or not

None that I can recall. I know one of my good friends quit (inaudible)
in first phase, he was rosining the log and I tried to get him not to
quit but he ended up quitting but that’s like the only

Yeah.

But other than that

Umm, so nobody kind of taking a short cut or anything like that. Ummm..
Why do you think you were successful during BUDS?

Childhood, umm….

What about that specifically?

Growing up just always being rough or playing backyard football or
baseball, ya know just

always training, always getting outdoors, outdoors is huge. And then,
uhh, another thing is just the support of my, if you have support that
will literally get you through 99% of BUDS. And also just uhh having an
edge, I don’t know I feel like just my own personal mentality, I just
wanted to succeed.

Yeah. Umm… Anything you notice that was different about those who didn’t
make it and more specifically those that quit?

Yes. I feel like, not for everybody, but the majority, when I see people
quit I think they were in it for the wrong reasons

What do you mean by that?

You know, the the glamor of being a SEAL I don’t think they really
actually wanted to do the work that the job entails

Um. How did this experience change you as a person?

Um it it really the more you train the more you realize you one you
either are actually doing it for the glamorous reasons or you’re
actually doing it for the job. I feel like the more I trained the more I
actually wanted the job and what its gonna take

Anything else you that you think I should’ve asked you that I didn’t ask
you

I I think the best question on that is what I believe it was uh what you
think I used I think in childhood

Yeah

Like the years of like 0 to 12, 10 or 12 most kids either grow up to
play video games or watching way too much TV or outdoors with their dad
and doing that type of stuff

Yeah and do you think that people that are outside

I really do believe

That it will set their children up for success

Yes, you have to

Haha when they beat each other to death

Haha yeah encourage that, encourage that

Okay, well that’s it

Thanks, Ma’am, thank you

OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE TOWN...OH LIKE I COULD JUST SO STAY AT THE OTHER
FAMILY’S HOUSE IF I’M GETTING YELLED AT SOO WE WOULD GET IN TROUBLE AND
IT WOULD BE LIKE OH JUST GO TO THE OTHER HOUSE. SO IT KIND OF LIKE, I
DONT KNOW, IT WASN’T GOOD IN THAT SENSE, BUT THEN WHEN I WENT INTO
COLLEGE, IT LIKE, IT WAS LIKE OKAY TIME TO BE AN ADULT BECAUSE
EVERYTHING WENT AWAY AND IT WAS LIKE JUST BECAME BETTER I GUESS.

 YEAH OKAY YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO WORRY. UHM WHAT ABOUT THE LAST 5 YEARS,
SO 5 YEARS KIND OF LEADING UP TO BUD/S, WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

 COLLEGE, LIKE NOT CRAZY PARTYING IN COLLEGES, IT WAS VERY LIKE WENT

WASNT DOING VERY WELL AND I WAS MORE FOCUSED ON LIKE, I DON’T KNOW,
GOING OUT AND DOING STUFF LIKE THAT WHERE KIND OF SET MYSELF UP FOR
DISASTER GOING DOWN THAT PATH AND I WAS LIKE I GOTTA CHANGE SO THEN I
FOCUSED ON THE GRADES, FOCUSED ON JUST WORKING OUT, CONDITIONG, CAUSE I
KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE LIKE MY GOAL AFTERWARDS, SO DID THAT AND
THEN AFTER COLLEGE JUST WENT AND WORKED IN CONSTRUCTION FOR A LITTLE
WHILE AND WE WERE LIKE TH….YEAH I GUESS WE KIND OF LIKE ALSO SHIFTED
FOCUS AND MADE SURE THAT WE KEPT WORKING HARD RATHER THAN GOING OUT
PARTYING WITH FRIENDS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, SOO I DIDN’T HANG OUT WITH
FRIENDS AS MUCH, IT WAS JUST MORE OF JUST FOCUS ON THIS.

BEHAVIORS BACK IN THE DAY, BUT NOT ANYMORE. JUST KIND OF LIKE TONED OUT,
MELLOWED DOWN AND KINDA LIKE NOT ANYMORE.

HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE…

 MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

 UHHH MY FAMILY. JUST ANYTHING LIKE THATS GOING ON, I JUST THINK I AM
DOING THIS FOR MY FAMILY AND UHM *COUGHS* SORRY EXCUSE ME AND UHH IT
JUST KINDA BRINGS ME BACK AND KEEPS ME GOING AND JUST IT COULD BE THE
WORST OF TIMES, I’M JUST I’M DOING THIS FOR MY FAMILY AND THAT KINDA
JUST RESETS EVERYTHING AND IT GIVES ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON IT, I’M LIKE
WELL THIS ISN’T THAT BAD.

 YEAH NOW FAMILY, YOU SAY FAMILY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR MOM OR DO
YOU HAVE…

 JUST, EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY LIKE EVERYBODY RELATED

 YEAH…ANYBODY...

 YEAH

 UHM… WHAT ABOUT BUD/S NOW, MORE SPECIFICALLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS
THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT? COULD BE... OVERALL, COULD BE A DAY OR
SPECIFIC EVENT…?

 UHM… I KNOW I HAD… THERE WAS ONE BAD DAY WHERE I HAD… I WAS LIKE ON
THE CHOPPING BLOCK CAUSE OF IT...LIKE I JUST… IT WAS BACK IN FIRST PHASE
AND THEN WE WERE RUNNING BOAT AND WE PICKED UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS
JUST LIKE NO MATTER WHAT I DID, I COULD NOT KEEP UP AND I KEPT TELLING
MYSELF JUST KEEP GOING, JUST KEEP GOING YOU’LL GET IT… I JUST COULDNT
KEEP UP AND… THAT WAS DEFINITELY LIKE… ONE DAY THAT WAS MORE CHALLENGING
THAN ANYTHING I’D EVER SEEN…

 YEAH…

 YEAH… AFTER THAT I TURNED IT AROUND, BUT I DON’T REALLY KNOW HOW IT
JUST KIND OF LIKE BECAME EASIER AFTER THAT…

 YEAH…

 SOO…

 AND YOU SAID THAT WAS FIRST PHASE?

 YEAH… FIRST PHASE

 WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER HELL WEEK?

 BEFORE HELL WEEK.

 UHM… WHAT KIND OF MOTIVATED YOU OVERALL TO PUSH THROUGH?

 AGAIN COMING BACK TO MY FAMILY, THAT’S 100% ANY KIND OF MOTIVATION
WAS MY FAMILY… AND NOT NECESSARILY LIKE, JUST, I DON’T KNOW, JUST MY
WHOLE IDEA BEHIND IT WAS, IT GOES BACK GENERATIONAL LIKE MY
GRANDPARENTS… WERE LIKE ALL MY GRANDPARENTS GENERATIONS… THEY ALL WENT
IN THE MILITARY JUST LIKE MY GRANDFATHER’S BROTHERS AND EVERYBODY AND
THEN LIKE MY LIKE DAD’S GENERATION, THEY DIDN’T GO IN THE MILITARY LIKE
NOBODY DID, SO I KIND OF FELT LIKE SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY HAD TO STICK TO
THAT BECAUSE THERE IS OTHER FAMILIES OUT HERE, WHERE THERE SONS AND
DAUGHTERS ARE GOING OFF...AND LIKE PROTECTING THEM WHETHER OR NOT YOU
REALIZE IT OR NOT SOMEBODY’S OUT THERE PROTECTING YOU, SO IT WAS LIKE
THAT SHOULD BE ME OR AT LEAST SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY OR SOMEBODY HAS TO
DO IT FOR MY FAMILY, SOO THAT’S MY IDEA BEHIND IT *GIGGLES*

 OKAY WHAT ABOUT AS A GROUP, DO YOU THINK...UHM...THROUGH THIS PROCESS
LIKE THE GROUP, EVERYBODY HERE SUPPORTING EACH OTHER, LIKE DID YOU FEEL
SUPPORTED AS A GROUP?

 YES AND NO, THERE IS DEFINITELY TIMES WHERE ITS LIKE IF A GUY LIKE
MESSES UP ITS KINDA LIKE AND KEEPS MESSING UP ITS KINDA LIKE GET HIM OUT
OF THERE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART I WOULD SAY ITS A GROUP THING, BUT WITH
SOME MINOR ASPECTS TO IT… *GIGGLES*

 THERE’S, THERE’S A CUT OFF

 YEAH, THERE’S A CUT OFF POINT

 IS THAT CUT OFF POINT REALLY WHEN PEOPLE AREN’T PERFORMING?

 YES, YEAH, SIMPLE, CUT AND DRY

 WHAT ABOUT WERE THERE ANY SPECIFIC PRACTICES YOU DID WHETHER
PHYSICAL, MENTAL, OR SPIRITUAL THAT YOU DID AS YOU PROGRESSED THROUGH
BUD/S?

 UHHH, GOD WAS DEFINITELY A BIG PART OF IT.... UHHHH ANYTIME THERE WAS
SOMETHING THAT I KNEW WAS GONNA BE HARD OR CHALLENGING, I WOULD JUST
PRAY AND ALSO PRAY FOR MY BUDDIES GOING THROUGH IT. AND I THINK FIRST
TIME, EVERY TIME IS A THING AND I KNOW SECOND TIME OR THIRD I’M JUST
LIKE PLEASE HELP ME. AND PLEASE HELP MY BUDDIES WHO ARE GOING THROUGH
THE SAME THING, SO YEAH IT WAS SPIRITUAL IN THAT SENSE.

 YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK, IF THERE WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION YOU HAD TO
MAKE HERE AT BUD/S, CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT DECISION A LITTLE BIT
AND WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION?

 I DON’T THINK THERE REALLY WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION, IT WAS KINDA
LIKE, ITS VERY SIMPLE AND IT’S JUST ONCE YOU REALIZE THAT IT’S SIMPLE,
EVERYTHING ELSE DIFFICULT ABOUT IT GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

 YEAH, SO SO, WHAT MAKES IT SIMPLE?

 UHM, I’VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE AND THAT’S LIKE AN HOUR LONG
DISCUSSION…

 YEAH, WE DON’T NEED TO GET INTO IT.

 YEAH *LAUGHS*

 BUT IS THERE LIKE, IS IT JUST NOT OVERTHINKING OR?

 YEAH, I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY IT’S JUST NOT OVERTHINKING ANYTHING.
EVERY, A LOT OF THE GUYS PROBLEMS IS THEY OVERTHINK IT, BUT IT LIKE, IT
GETS THEM TO THE POINT WHERE IT’S JUST LIKE THEY CAN’T HANDLE IT AND
THEY’LL TALK ABOUT IT AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU’RE JUST
LIKE “CALM DOWN, TAKE A BREATH” AND IT COMES DOWN TO JUST SIMPLY BREATHE
AND LIKE DON’T OVERTHINK IT.

 SO WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL?

 WHY??

 YEAH, AT BUD/S.

 UHM, BECAUSE I WAS CALM AND JUST BREATHED.

 YEAH

 LIKE GOING BACK TO LIKE, I GUESS I GOTTA CREDIT MASTER CHIEF BARACHI
WITH THIS...UHHH… HE WOULD TEACH US STUFF LIKE HEY, JUST GET MAD AND
STEP BACK FROM IT ALL

 YEAH

 JUST ONE SECOND EVEN

 *MIC SCUFFLED* IT’S LOUD (UNSURE)

 JUST TAKE ONE SECOND STEP BACK AND THEN YOU’LL REALIZE THAT IT’S NOT
THAT BAD AND IT’S NOT THAT HARD AND IT’S NOT THAT COMPLICATED AND THEN
YOU’RE JUST LIKE WOW OKAY I CAN DO THIS.

 UHM, DO YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT
THROUGH BUD/S AND THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN’T?

 I MEAN, BEFORE, FROM FIRST PHASE, YES AND THEN FROM THERE ON, NO.
EVERY GUY WAS KINDA THE SAME THEY JUST HAD THEIR HICCUPS.

 WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENT IN FIRST PHASE FOR THOSE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT?

 PROBABLY JUST MINDSET.

 YEAH…

 LIKE YOU’D SEE GUYS LIKE JUST OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING OR JUST EVEN
HOW THEY ACTED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU COULD TELL LIKE THEY JUST
DIDN’T WANNA BE HERE, SO.

 OKAY, I’M DONE WITH YOU *GIGGLES*

UHM, PRIOR TO BUD/S? UHM, I THINK A BIG LIFE CHANGING EVENT FOR ME WAS
WHEN ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. THAT
DEFINITELY MADE ME A MORE RELIGIOUS PERSON.

 HOW DID THAT EXPERIENCE FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT BUD/S?

UHM, I DON’T KNOW, I JUST STARTED, UH LIKE GOING TO CHURCH MORE AND MORE
LIKE FAITH, YOU KNOW I GUESS I TOOK THAT INTO BUD/S AND LIKE
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

SERIOUSLY LIKE JOKING AROUND A LOT.

SO YOU DON’T TAKE THINGS TOO SERIOUSLY?

YEAH, LIKE, HAVE FUN WITH IT.

  DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING PART
    OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY. AND IN PARTICULAR, DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS AS
    FAMILY OR FRIENDS OR MILITARY FAMILY, FRIENDS?

YEAH, I GREW UP IN VIRGINIA BEACH, AND IT WAS LIKE 2 MILES FROM DAM NECK
WHERE I LIVE SO, ALL MY LIKE CHILDHOOD FRIEND’S DADS WERE IN THE TEAMS.
AND A TON OF MY FRIENDS ALREADY WENT THROUGH TOO. THERE’S LIKE 6 GUYS
FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH WHO WENT STRAIGHT
THROUGH.

SO YOU HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO ARE ALREADY SEALS?

YEAH, WE MAYBE ALL WANTED TO DO IT SINCE LIKE 2ND GRADE.

DO WHAT?

SINCE LIKE SECOND GRADE I WANTED TO DO THIS.

 TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW
    WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR
    PARENTS PARENTING STYLE? (SPANKING, TIMEOUTS, WITHHOLDING TOYS,
    ETC.).

UH, MY PARENTS WERE PRETTY STRICT ON ME. UHM, I’D SAY MY WHAT MY DAD
STRESSED A LOT WAS BEING TOUGH ALL THE TIME. LIKE NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER
QUIT ANYTHING. HE DEFINITELY TOLD ME THAT SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.

DID THEY, WERE YOU SPANKED? GROUNDED?

NO

NO? WHAT THINGS...HOW WERE YOUR PARENTS STRICT?

UHM, I MEAN, THEY WOULD GET ON ME ABOUT LIKE GRADES AND STUFF. BUT, UH,
THEY NEVER REALLY LIKE GROUNDED ME OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

 DID YOU MOVE AROUND AS A CHILD?

NO.

DURING YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? NO MOVING?

NOPE, ONLY IN COLLEGE. CAUSE I WENT TO NORTH CAROLINA STATE SO I WAS IN
RALIEGH.

HOW’D YOU CHOOSE NC STATE?

UHM, IT’S ONLY LIKE 3 HOURS AWAY AND UH, I WANTED TO DO ROTC THERE. AND
UH, ENDED UP NOT SO I WENT THERE, DID ROTC FOR LIKE THE FIRST SEMESTER
AND I DECIDED I WANTED TO GO ENLISTED, BUT I STILL LOVED THE SCHOOL SO I
DECIDED TO STAY THERE.

I TEACH AT DUKE SO...

UHM, SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS. DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN A
    TEAM SPORT?

YEAH I DID, UH WRESTLED, PLAYED FOOTBALL, SOCCER.

THOSE WERE THE THREE?

YEP, THOSE WERE THE THREE.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO
    STARTING AT BUD/S?

UHM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIKE UH LIKE I WAS IN COLLEGE.

COLLEGE?

YEAH.

SO AS SOON AS YOU GOT OUT OF COLLEGE YOU ENLISTED?

YES, I WENT RIGHT OUT OF MY COLLEGE HOUSE.

WHAT WAS YOUR DEGREE IN?

CRIMINOLOGY

THAT’S THE SAME SORT OF TRACK I TOOK.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UH, I DON’T, I DON’T THINK SO.

DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

NO

  WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? OR YOUR
    HARDEST, HARDEST DAY OR HARDEST EVENT?

HARDEST DAY? OKAY, SO UM IT WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT OC 8.

THE WHAT?

OC 8, THE POOL COMP, AND I BLACKED OUT UNDERWATER, AND I GOT PULLED OUT
ON A STRETCHER AND STUFF THEN THEY WERE LIKE ‘ALRIGHT, YOUR SECOND
ATTEMPT IS TOMORROW.’ SO I JUST GO IN THE NEXT DAY LIKE AFTER THAT KIND
OF LIKE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, SO IT WAS TOUGH LIKE CALMING MY NERVES
AFTER THAT.

SO YOU, HOW...WHAT CAUSED YOU TO BLACK OUT?

DIDN’T HAVE ANY AIR. I HAD A KNOT AND COULDN’T GET IT UNDONE AND UM I
LIKE FLIPPED IT OFF MY BACK AND STARTED WORKING ON IT JUST WAS LIKE
TAKING TO LONG AND STARTED CONVULSING AND TOOK IN WATER AND I WAS OUT
AND NEXT TIME I WOKE UP I WAS JUST ON A LITTLE STRETCHER ON THE SIDE OF
THE POOL AND THEY WERE SLAPPING MY FACE.

 SO, WHAT MOTIVATED TO PUSH THROUGH AFTER THAT?

IT WAS HONESTLY JUST CAUSE I WANTED TO BE WITH THE BOYS. I DIDN’T WANT
TO GET PULLED LIKE ALL MY FRIENDS WERE IN 38 SO I WAS JUST LIKE I GOT TO
PASS THIS

DID YOU FEEL SUPPORT FROM THE GROUP?

YEAH, YEAH NO EVERYBODY WANTED TO PASS SO.

 WHAT UM, IN GENERAL, WHAT PRACTICES (PHYSICAL, MENTAL,
    SPIRITUAL) DID YOU UTILIZE TO PUSH THROUGH OR GET THROUGH THE
    CHALLENGES?

CHALLENGES? UH, I JUST WOULD GET IN MY HEAD AND SAY THAT GOD’S GOT ME NO
MATTER WHAT, THEN I JUST PUSHED THE WORRY AWAY AND I DON’T REALLY THINK
MUCH ABOUT IT. S

  WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING, WHAT WENT
    THROUGH YOUR MIND, UH, AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? WHAT DECISION
    DID YOU REALLY STRUGGLE WITH? UHM THE EXAMPLE IS UH, THEY HAVE
    HERE IS RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT, UH OR TURNING IN A CHEATING
    CLASSMATE.

UHM, I CAN’T THINK OF A SPECIFIC TIME, BUT I KNOW WHEN I’VE HAD TO MAKE
TOUGH DECISIONS, I USUALLY JUST GO WITH MY GUT, BECAUSE I TRUST MY GUT.

  WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING THIS?

I THINK IT’S BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN’T HAVE, I DIDN’T REALLY HAVE THE
OPTION OF QUITTING OR FAILING BECAUSE ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE
ALREADY MADE IT SO IT WAS LIKE I DIDN’T WANT TO BE THAT GUY WHO WOULD BE
A DISGRACE TO ALL OF THEM. I WAS PERFECTLY FINE WITH DYING OUT THERE IF
I HAD TO.

 DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE
    IT?

I THINK THE GUYS WHO DID NOT MAKE IT WOULD GET WORRIED ABOUT ALL THE
LITTLE THINGS AND NOT THINK OF LIKE BIG PICTURE. THERE’S A LOT OF GUYS
WHO WOULD BE LIKE SUPER BEFORE A SWIMMER INSPECTION OR SOMETHING WHICH
IS SO SMALL, YOU JUST DO LIKE PUSH UPS OR SOMETHING IF YOU FAIL AND LIKE
THERE’S NO TIME...THERE’S NO NEED TO STRESS OVER THAT.

ANYTHING ELSE?

UHM, I DON’T KNOW, I WOULDN’T EVEN SAY IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER WHAT
SHAPE YOU’RE IN TO GET TO THIS POINT AND OBVIOUSLY I’M IN THE SHAPE TO
MAKE IT THROUGH I WOULD SAY JUST WORRYING TOO MUCH. AND NOT HAVING FUN
WITH IT.

  BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE, GOING THROUGH THE
    PROGRAM, CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

Uhm, I think it definitely made me a better person just because I
learned how to deal with failure all the time.

To deal with what?

Deal with failure. Taking it, learning it, and moving on. I think
that’s a great skill people can have. It also made me realize like
you’re not going to be good at everything the first time you try it.
But you always have to at least try.

Is there anything else that I should have asked you, but didn’t?

Probably not, that was good.

Great.

Alright, thank you.

OK.

UM, AND THEN, KIND OF WAS JUST DOING ODDBALL JOBS, AND THEN DECIDED THAT
I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. AND, DECIDED TO DO THIS.

OK.

WAS KIND OF JUST RANDOM.

SO IT WASN'T LIKE A LIFELONG (UNINTELLIGIBLE)-

NO, I, I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY KNOW...I KNEW ABOUT NAVY SEALS, BUT I DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT.

OK.

 OK. I'LL ASK YOU MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY IN JUST A SECOND. ABOUT,
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY. UM, WHAT'S IT LIKE AND HOW
DO YOU THINK IT CONTRIBUTED TO GETTING THROUGH BUD/S?

UM, SO FOR ME PERSONALLY, I DON'T REALLY TAKE THINGS TOO SERIOUSLY. I
THINK, JUST, HAVING FUN, HELPED ME GET THROUGH THIS. UM, I MEAN, I KNOW
SOME PEOPLE ARE PRETTY, PRETTY SERIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THIS. BUT
I JUST COULDN'T BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

YEAH.

HAD TO HAVE FUN. JOKE AROUND. UM.

DO YOU THINK THAT’S THE DEMEANOR OF MOST PEOPLE? OR?

UM, YEAH, I’D SAY AT LEAST HALF OF THE GUYS ARE PRETTY, LAID BACK, AND
HAVE FUN WITH IT.

 UM, DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF, A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY
BACKGROUND. I MEAN, MILITARY FAMILY AT ALL?

UM, SO MY GRAND-MY GRANDPA WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.

OK.

UM, BUT, I MEAN, THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY, YOU KNOW, IMPACT ON ME
JOINING.

YEAH.

I MEAN MY DAD WASN'T IN THE MILITARY. UM, JUST, JUST KIND OF, RANDOMLY.

YEAH. SO, UM, ANY FRIENDS…?

NO, UM, I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT I WOULD EVER JOIN THE MILITARY.

OK.

IT WASN'T SOMETHING I EVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO. YEAH, I DON'T HAVE ANY
FRIENDS THAT, UM, CLOSE FRIENDS AT LEAST, THAT.

WHAT YEAR WAS IT WHEN YOU WERE LIKE OK, THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

SO, PROBABLY, I WANT TO SAY, 2018.

OK.

UM, YEAH.

AND DID YOU JOIN RIGHT AWAY?

NO, SO I KIND OF RESEARCHED IT A LITTLE BIT.

OK.

AND I KNEW I HAD TO LIKE, I ALREADY KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WORKED OUT A LOT.
DIDN'T SWIM HARD.

YEAH,

I KNEW HOW TO SWIM, CAUSE I GREW UP IN CALIFORNIA.

OK.

WENT TO THE BEACH, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO, YOU KNOW, SWIM FOR A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.

YEAH.

OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. UM, I TRAINED FOR A LITTLE BIT, MAYBE A FEW
MONTHS, AND THEN JUST, UM, WENT AHEAD, WENT AHEAD AND ENLISTED.

UH, WHERE DID YOU GROW UP IN CALIFORNIA?

UH, ORANGE COUNTY.

OK.

SO LIKE, ANAHEIM

OK.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE).

 UM, WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENT’S PARENTING STYLE? WERE THEY STRICT?
WERE THEY DISCIPLINED?

UM, SO MY MOM PRETTY STRICT, MY DAD, NOT SO MUCH. UH, I MEAN, I WENT TO
LIKE A, I WENT TO A PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL, GROWING UP, FOR A FEW
YEARS. UM, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WASN'T LIKE SUPER CRAZY, BUT I WOULD
SAY MY MOM WAS ON THE STRICTER SIDE.

YEAH. IT'S INTERESTING. MOMS SEEM LIKE THEY’RE THE STRICT ONES.

YEAH.

I THINK I'M LIKE, I THINK I'M THE STRICTER ONE IN OUR HOUSE TOO.
(LAUGHTER) DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

 BUT, UM, SO, ANY LIKE DISCIPLINE, WHAT DID, WERE YOU PUT ON TIME
OUTS? WERE YOU SPANKED? LIKE WHAT WAS THE (UNINTELLIGIBLE) DISCIPLINE?

UM, I REMEMBER, SHE WOULD, SHE WOULD TAKE THINGS AWAY, NOT LET ME GO DO
THINGS WITH FRIENDS, AND UM STUFF LIKE THAT. UM, MAYBE AS A YOUNG CHILD
MAYBE I GOT SPANKED OR SOMETHING.

YEAH.

I DON'T.

NOTHING TOO LIKE… STANDS OUT?

NO, NO, NO, NOTHING REALLY, TOO CRAZY.

 OK. WHAT ABOUT, UM, DID YOU MOVE AT ALL DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD
YEARS?

NO, I, UH, LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE, UH, PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE LIFE.

 UM, WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS? SPORTS THAT YOU PLAYED, TELL ME
A LITTLE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL.

BASEBALL, FOOTBALL. MY DAD WAS ALWAYS THERE TO HELP ME WITH THAT.

 UM, HOW DO YOU THINK BEING PART OF, KIND OF, THOSE TYPES OF
COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE?

UM, I THINK IT HELPED A LOT. UM, CAUSE THERE ARE SOME GUYS THAT I KNOW
THAT ARE IN THIS PROGRAM OR WERE IN THIS PROGRAM THAT UH, DIDN'T REALLY
PLAY SPORTS.

YEAH.

I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARDER FOR THEM TO, LIKE, ADJUST TO THAT
TYPE OF UH, ATMOSPHERE, IN TERMS OF THE TEAM, AND NOT BEING SELFISH, I
GUESS. SO, I THINK THAT HELPED A LOT. KNOWING THAT, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE’S
GOT TO DO SOMETHING, TO HELP, YOU KNOW, MAKE THIS WORK.

 UM, WHAT ABOUT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE? SO, YOU WENT TO
COLLEGE. SO, WHERE DID YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

UH, I WENT TO A FEW DIFFERENT COLLEGES. I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP TO PLAY
BASEBALL AT NORTHWEST MISSOURI STATE.

OK.

UM, WENT THERE FOR A YEAR. I PLAYED, DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT. KIND OF
BORING OUT THERE, AND THEN MOVED BACK, WENT TO (UNINTELLIGIBLE, MAYBE
GENERAL?) COLLEGE, AND THEN, FOLLOWING, I WENT TO A SCHOOL IN
CALIFORNIA, CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS.

OK.

UM, AND THEN I ACTUALLY, JUST STOPPED PLAYING BASEBALL, WAS KIND OF JUST
OVER IT.

YEAH.

KIND OF LIKE, THOUGHT IT WAS A DEAD END. AND THEN UH, ACTUALLY MOVED TO
UH, SAN ANTONIO UM, KIND OF JUST UP AND LEFT. IT WASN'T REALLY PLANNED
EITHER. KIND OF JUST, JUST KIND OF WENT OUT. I DON'T KNOW.

AND DID YOU, SO DID YOU FINISH COLLEGE HERE? AND?

UH, NO. I ACTUALLY DIDN'T FINISH.

OK.

I, I HAVE UH, JUST AN ASSOCIATES DEGREE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

OK. OK, AND THEN WHAT DID YOU DO IN SAN ANTONIO?

I UH, WELL, ACTUALLY MY WIFE, UH, HER FAMILY MOVED OUT THERE A FEW YEARS
BEFORE WE DID.

‘CAUSE HER DAD WAS BORN THERE, AND THEN MOVED TO CALIFORNIA WHEN HE WAS
YOUNGER. AND THEN ENDED UP MOVING BACK BECAUSE HE GOT A GOOD JOB OUT
THERE. UH, I ACTUALLY MET MY WIFE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. UM, DATED IN HIGH
SCHOOL, STAYED TOGETHER IN COLLEGE, AND THEN WE ENDED UP MOVING OUT
THERE.

AND WHEN DID YOU GUYS GET MARRIED?

UM, 2018

WAS THAT BEFORE YOU JOINED THE MILITARY?

YES. YEAR BEFORE.

ANY KIDS?

NO.

NOW, IS SHE HERE, IN SAN DIEGO? OR IS SHE STILL IN SAN ANTONIO?

UH, NOT YET. SHE’S, SHE’S UM, PLANNING ON MOVING OUT HERE IN THE NEXT
FEW MONTHS.

OK.

JUST WAITING FOR HER JOB TO OPEN UP.

YEAH. WHAT ABOUT UM, AND SO THEN, I’M SORRY IF I ASKED THIS. I GUESS
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).

NO, IT’S ALL GOOD.

YOUR BRAIN STARTS TO GO-

YEAH.

A LITTLE FUZZY. UM, WHEN DID YOU JOIN THE MILITARY?

UH, 2018.

OK.

UH, SEPTEMBER SOMETIME.

AND THEN BOOTCAMP AND STRAIGHT HERE?

SO I UH, I ACTUALLY GOT ROLLED IN PREP. SO I, UM, WENT TO BOOT CAMP,
WENT TO PREP, GOT ROLLED TWO CLASSES BECAUSE OF A CALF INJURY. AND THEN
CAME OUT HERE WITH 3-8, UM MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO 3RD PHASE AND THEN GOT
ROLLED. AND AM HERE NOW.

HOW DID THAT, GETTING ROLLED IN PREP, DO YOU THINK THAT IMPACTED YOU?

IT WAS PRETTY, PRETTY, PRETTY HORRIBLE. I JUST, IT WAS LIKE, I DIDN'T
ENJOY MYSELF OUT THERE, NOBODY REALLY DOES.

YEAH.

IT'S PRETTY BORING. JUST GOT TRAPPED. UM, BUT I THINK IT HELPED ME
MENTALLY, JUST GOING THROUGH HARD THINGS. UM, HELPS OUT A LOT
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).

 DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE AT ALL?

UH SOMETIMES. NOT IN, NOT IN ALL ASPECTS, BUT IN SOME, SOME THINGS I
GUESS. UM, JUST DEPENDS.

 YEAH. WHAT UM, WHAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR FOR
YOU?

DOING THIS.

YEAH.

UM, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO JUST, TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE, YOU KNOW?
I FELT LIKE I WASN'T REALLY DOING ANYTHING, UM, I DON'T KNOW, I JUST, I
DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE AND DIE AND THERE BE NO YOU KNOW, NOTHING GOOD TO
SAY ABOUT ME.

YEAH.

OR JUST, STUFF LIKE THAT.

 UM, ANY TATTOOS?

NO TATTOOS.

OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? ANY BUNCH OF SPEEDING TICKETS? OR?

NO, I’VE ONLY GOTTEN ONE TICKET

  WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S? (HOLISTIC
    QUESTION) (THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY OR EVENT AT BUD/S)

UM, PROBABLY BEING AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

YEAH.

THAT WAS ONE OF THEM. AND UM, OTHER THAN THAT, I MEAN, IT’S HARD, BUT I
MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I WAS ABLE TO HANDLE IT PRETTY WELL.

YEAH.

SO

UM, WHAT ABOUT WITH YOUR WIFE? I MEAN, HOW DID THAT KIND OF, DID, WAS
SHE, DID YOU SEE HER AS A SUPPORT SYSTEM AS YOU WENT THROUGH THIS?

UH, YES, NO, DEFINITELY. SHE, SHE DEFINITELY HELPED ME OUT A LOT. UM,
SAY, I'VE KNOWN HER FOR SO LONG, SHE’S ALWAYS BEEN AROUND, AND UM, JUST
BEING AWAY, YOU KNOW, WAS KIND OF TOUGH. I'VE ONLY SEEN HERE A HANDFUL
OF TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR. YEAH, SHE DEFINITELY HELPED ME A LOT. CAUSE,
YOU KNOW.

 WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET THROUGH? DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE
    SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

UH, I WOULD SAY A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS, UM, ESPECIALLY GOING INTO HELL
WEEK. UH, DEFINITELY COULD NOT CALL MY WIFE AND TELL HER I QUIT, SO I
JUST WASN'T GOING TO DO THAT. AND THEN MY, I WOULD SAY MY DAD. THERE WAS
NO WAY I COULD, YOU KNOW, LET HIM DOWN.

WOULD HE HAVE BEEN LET DOWN?

NO. HE, IT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY JUST LET ME DOWN, YOU KNOW, THINKING
THAT, I HAVE THIS WEIRD THING WHERE I JUST WANT TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE HIM
PROUD, AND I KNOW NO MATTER WHAT I DO, EVEN IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT, HE
WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN PROUD, UM, JUST, I DON'T, I COULDN'T EVER SEE ANY
QUITTING, HAVING MY HELMET DOWN ON THE GRINDER WITH HIS LAST NAME ON
THERE, JUST NOT, NOT SOMETHING I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO, HONESTLY. I'VE
NEVER UNDERSTOOD, I GUESS, I KNOW WHY PEOPLE QUIT BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY DO IT. I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT. SO IT'S JUST A WEIRD,
WEIRD THING.

YEAH.

 WERE THERE ANY PRACTICES YOU UTILIZED TO GET THROUGH THIS? LIKE
    SPIRITUAL, MENTAL, PHYSICAL?

UH, NOT REALLY. UM, BUT I WOULD SAY ALMOST ALL OF IT IS MENTAL. UM,
ANYONE CAN, CAN TRAIN AND GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE, PHYSICALLY, TO
PASS ALL THE, YOU KNOW, EVOLUTIONS AND WHATNOT. BUT IT REALLY COMES DOWN
TO EITHER YOU WANT TO DO THIS OR YOU DON'T. THAT'S REALLY ALL IT IS. I
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET, YOU KNOW, BEING A SEAL ISN'T, YOU
KNOW, BOATS AND LOGS AND HELL WEEK, ITS, UM, NOT THAT FOREVER, THERE'S
AN END TO ALL OF IT, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU START DOING STUFF THAT
YOU'LL END UP USING IN THE JOB.

  WAS THERE ANY TIME WHERE YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION
    AT BUD/S, UM, WHETHER IT WAS AN ETHICAL OR MORAL DECISION
    PERSONALLY, OR YOU WATCHED SOMEBODY MAYBE CUT A CORNER AND YOU HAD
    TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT?

UM, NO I NEVER REALLY RAN INTO THAT, UM, AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I
WOULD DO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, JUST DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION. UM, I’M NOT
SURE.

  WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

UM, I THINK IT'S JUST AS SIMPLE AS, JUST WANTING TO DO IT, NOT QUITTING.
JUST, THAT'S REALLY ALL IT IS. JUST WANT TO BE, BETTER I GUESS.

HAVE YOU EVER HAD THAT ATTITUDE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR LIFE? LIKE
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)?

UM, BASEBALL FOR SURE. I REALLY WORKED REALLY HARD. UM, A LOT HARDER
THAN, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL, UM, GUYS WOULD GO HOME AND I
WOULD STAY AFTER AND HIT AND DO WHATEVER. JUST WANTING TO BE THE BEST,
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I WASN’T. SOMEONE IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN YOU. UM, YOU
GOTTA HAVE THAT, THAT ATTITUDE. SO.

 ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU NOTICED ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT MADE
    IT THROUGH BUD/S, AND THE PEOPLE THAT QUIT SPECIFICALLY?

UM, WELL I KNOW, IT'S WEIRD, CAUSE THERE'S GUYS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY A
LOT, YOU KNOW, MORE MADE OUT FOR THIS, AND THAT DON'T MAKE IT. UM, I
THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF US ARE, ARE NOT,
YOU KNOW, THE BEST AT UH, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN THINGS, AND WE KNOW FAILURE
AND WE’RE ABLE TO ACCEPT THAT, AND BASICALLY MOVE ON AND WANT, YOU KNOW,
TO BE THE BEST. AND, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE, ARE GOOD AT CERTAIN
THINGS, ALMOST EVERYTHING, THEY'RE NOT USED TO THAT FAILURE AND THEY
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT. THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN, YOU KNOW, GOOD AT
EVERYTHING THEY DO. SO.

  BONUS QUESTION - HOW DOES THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON, IF AT ALL?

UM, I FEEL LIKE I'M SOMEWHAT THE SAME PERSON. UM, PROBABLY WOULD SAY,
WOULDN'T SAY CAREFREE, BUT JUST FEEL LIKE BEFORE, GROWING UP I WAS
PRETTY, I WOULD SAY I WAS A PRETTY GOOD KID, DIDN'T GET INTO ANY TROUBLE
REALLY. UH, DIDN'T EVEN DRINK UNTIL AFTER I WAS 21. I JUST FEEL LIKE I
AM A LITTLE MORE RELAXED, BECAUSE I WAS MAYBE MORE UPTIGHT GROWING UP.
JUST TRYING TO LIKE, I HAD MY HEAD ON STRAIGHT, WITH SCHOOL AND
BASEBALL, UM, I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE MORE, LIKE, YEAH, LAID
BACK PRETTY MUCH. JUST KINDA…

ANYTHING THAT I DIDN'T ASK THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO
KNOW?

UM, NO, I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WAS,

FEEL LIKE WE COVERED IT?

YEAH YOU GOT IT ALL.

WELL I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME, THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS

THANK YOU.

 HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

 I HAVE TWO BROTHERS.

 TWO BROTHERS. WHAT’S THEIR BIRTH ORDER?

 UHMMM, MY OLDER BROTHER IS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME AND MY YOUNGER
BROTHER IS SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME.

 OKAY, SO YOU’RE IN THE MIDDLE?

 YES.

 AND HOW MUCH DID YOU SAY YOUR YOUNGER WAS TWO YEARS?

 SIX YEARS.

 SIX YEARS, OH THAT’S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

 YUP.

 UHM IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
AS KIND OF YOUR CRUCIBLE OR LIFE-SHAPING EXPERIENCES BEYOND BUD/S?

 UHM… I DON’T KNOW I GUESS WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE, I HAD A HARD TIME
WITH UH ENGINEERING SCHOOL.

 YEAH..

 BUT I WOULD STUDY A LOT AND I’D PASS, SO I DID ALRIGHT, BUT…

 ANYTHING PRIOR TO COLLEGE THAT WAS KIND OF…

 UHH, I RAN CROSS COUNTRY AND I DIDN’T REALLY LIKE IT, BUT I STUCK
WITH IT… UHM… I DON’T KNOW, YEAH NOT NOT TOO MUCH I GUESS I MEAN MY
PARENTS… OH I GUESS LIKE 2008 WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS AND WHAT NOT

 YEAH.

 MY DAD’S JOB GOT LIKE PRETTY CUTBACK LIKE WORK WAS SLOW FOR AWHILE
SO, MY PARENTS TIGHTENED UP A LOT OF THINGS THERE… UHM… YEAH THAT’S
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING THAT DEFINITELY CHANGED A LOT ABOUT ME LIKE
OUR LIFE SITUATION.

 YEAH, WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?

 UHH, PHILLIPSBURG, NEW JERSEY.

 OKAY

 IT’S LIKE NEAR UHH PENNSYLVANIA.

 UHM, SO DO YOU THINK THOSE EXPERIENCES KIND OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
EXPERIENCES SHAPED KIND OF YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE AT BUD/S?

 YEAH, I THINK TO A DEGREE, I DON’T KNOW I WOULD ALWAYS BE REALLY
COMPETITIVE IN SPORTS I WAS IN WITH MY OLDER BROTHER, BUT HE BEAT ME A
LOT SINCE HE WAS OLDER AND BIGGER.

 YEAH

 UHM, BUT I ALWAYS STILL PLAYED, I DON’T KNOW I DIDN’T REALLY MIND
LOSING SO MUCH, I MEAN I DIDN’T LIKE IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME LIKE I GOT
IT.

 DO YOU THINK KIND OF THE ACT OF LOSING, KIND OF SET YOUR MIND,
BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN’T REALLY WIN HERE, RIGHT? YOU JUST HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THE EVENT. DID THAT KIND OF HELP?

 YEAH, I’M PRETTY GOOD AT LOSING, LIKE I DEAL WITH IT PRETTY WELL. I’M
NOT SUPER COMPETITIVE WHICH IS I GUESS IS KIND OF RARE FOR THIS PROGRAM,
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES ITS THE REALLY COMPETITIVE GUYS, LIKE WHEN THEY
CAN’T DO SOMETHING, IT REALLY BREAKS THEM DOWN, WHERE I’VE ALREADY KIND
OF, I’M USED TO THAT STUFF, SO I DIDN’T REALLY GET PHASED TOO MUCH.

 UHM, WHAT ABOUT, COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR
PERSONALITY AND HOW THAT KIND OF CONTRIBUTED TO YOU GOING THROUGH BUD/S?

 UHM, I LIKE TO MAKE FRIENDS… UHM I TREAT EVERYONE USUALLY LIKE LIKE
NOONE’S BETTER THAN ME AT LEAST I DON’T THINK SO, UHM AND NOONES LIKE
WORSE THAN ME EITHER… UHM, BUT YEAH JUST KIND OF TREAT EVERYONE AS NICE
AS POSSIBLE WHETHER THEY’RE LIKE A CUSTODIAN OR LIKE A CEO I GUESS

 YEAH

 SO EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN IS KIND OF ALL THE SAME TO ME.

 SO, UHM, YOU KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT, BUT UHM I WANT TO
GO IN A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, SO WHAT ABOUT YOUR
BACKGROUND KIND OF LEAD YOU TO WANT TO BECOME PART OF THE SEAL
COMMUNITY?

 I WOULD PLAY LIKE GUNS A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID AND I JUST ALWAYS
THOUGHT IT WAS COOL… YEAH UHM BASICALLY I JUST SAW LIKE A LOT OF WAR
MOVIES AND STUFF AND I WAS ALWAYS JUST INTO IT. I DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT
SPARKED THAT, BUT… KIND OF MADE ME…

 WERE YOU PART OF A MILITARY FAMILY AT ALL?

 NO.

 UHM, ANYBODY ELSE AROUND YOU, KIND OF IN YOUR LIFE THAT WAS MILITARY,
THAT, SORRY I’M JUST TURNING *CANT HEAR*

 YEAH MY UNCLE WAS AN ARMY RANGER, BUT I DIDN’T REALLY KNOW THAT AND
MY COUSIN WAS A MARINE, BUT HE WAS JUST KIND OF A DESK CLERK, HE DIDN’T
REALLY DO ANYTHING COMBAT, BUT I DON’T KNOW I LOOKED UP TO THEM, I
GUESS.

 WHAT ABOUT, I WANNA TALK ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, LIKE PRE-TEENAGE
YEARS. WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? WHAT WAS YOUR PARENT’S PARENTING STYLE LIKE?

 UHM, THEY WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE SPANK ME IF I WAS DOING BAD STUFF AND
LIKE I DEFINITELY DIDN’T CROSS THEM, LIKE SOMETIMES I WOULD BE
REBELLIOUS, BUT I’D GET PUT IN MY PLACE REAL QUICKLY UHM, I DON’T KNOW I
GUESS IT WAS JUST, I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD THOUGH. IT WAS DEFINITELY
BETTER THAN SPOILING YOUR KIDS OR YOU KNOW REALLY JUST, LIKE IT WAS A
GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN LIKE YOU KNOW THEM BEING REALLY GOOD PARENTS AND
GIVING US STUFF WE WANTED, BUT ALSO LAYING DOWN THE HAMMER WHEN WE WERE
NOT BEING GOOD OR DOING BAD THINGS I GUESS, LIKE.

 UHM, DID YOU MOVE AROUND AT ALL IN YOUR CHILDHOOD OR WERE YOU ALL
LIKE…

 NEVER. YEAH JUST THE SAME HOME FOREVER.

 OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS, WHAT WERE THEY LIKE…?

 UHM… I RAN CROSS COUNTRY SO I WASN’T LIKE THE BIGGEST KID… UH… I
DON’T KNOW I GUESS I GOT BULLIED A LITTLE BIT, BUT I DIDN’T REALLY CARE
TOO MUCH. I WOULD WALK AROUND THE HALL SMILING ALL THE TIME, BUT I DON’T
LIKE YEAH I’D GET CALLED NAMES AND STUFF. BUT I WAS, I NEVER REALLY LIKE
LET IT BREAK ME DOWN I GUESS, BUT…

 YEAH, DO YOU THINK YOU GOT BULLIED LIKE ANYMORE THAN OTHER KIDS, LIKE
PARTICULAR RACE OR…

 NO I WASN’T LIKE A SUPER VICTIM, YEAH I JUST THINK I GOT BULLIED LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE DOES…

 YEAH…

 BUT NOT NOTHING LIKE CRAZY.

 YEAH, UHM YOU SAID YOU DID CROSS COUNTRY, DID YOU DO ANY OTHER SPORTS
OR DID YOU DO ANY OTHER LIKE TEAM THAT WASN’T A SPORT, BUT A TEAM TYPE
OF THING?

 UHM, I DID, I DID SWIMMING AND BASEBALL.

 OKAY.

 BUT I REALLY LIKED SURFING, THAT WAS MY FAVORITE THING… UHH AND
SKATEBOARDING.

 WHAT MADE YOU LIKE THOSE?

 I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE FUN, I DON’T KNOW KIND OF DANGEROUS I GUESS,
BUT LIKE THEY KIND OF GIVE YOU A RUSH, SO I LIKE THAT.

 DID YOU HAVE A GROUP YOU SURFED WITH OR SKATEBOARDED WITH?

 YEAH I HAD A BUNCH OF CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AND WE ALL SURFED AND IT WAS
LIKE THE MOST FUN THING I COULD HAVE EVER DONE, LIKE WAY MORE FUN THAN
TEAM SPORTS. I DON’T KNOW, I DIDN’T REALLY LIKE TEAM SPORTS THAT MUCH
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, IT WASN’T AS FUN AS SURFING WITH MY FRIENDS.

 YEAH

 BUT.

 OKAY *PAUSE* UHM, WHAT ABOUT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, UHM I KNOW
*CANNOT UNDERSTAND* WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR TIME AWAY?

 UHM, I WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEN I GOT A JOB AS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER
FOR TWO YEARS.

 OKAY

 AND THEN I ALWAYS HAD THIS IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, UHM, WELL ACTUALLY
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT AND I KEPT PUTTING IT OFF AND I THINK I
SHOULD’VE DONE IT A LOT SOONER. I FEEL LIKE I ALMOST WASTED TIME, BUT IT
IS WHAT IT IS, I AM HERE NOW, SO I AM PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
DEFINITELY DON’T REGRET IT AT ALL, SO I AM REALLY EXCITED NOW.

 UHM, DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD’VE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL IF YOU WOULD’VE
DONE IT SOONER?

 I’M NOT TOO SURE, PART OF ME THINKS I WOULD’VE BEEN FINE JUST CAUSE
LIKE NO ONES REALLY, NOT REALLY A MATTER OF WHETHER YOU’RE A PHYSICAL
SPECIMEN OR NOT, BUT I THINK, I DON’T KNOW, I DON’T THINK IT HURT HAVING
SOME MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE.

 YEAH, UHM, WHAT ABOUT, UHH, DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE AT
ALL?

 IN WHAT..?

 IMPULSIVE.

 YEAH, I DON’T REALLY LIKE TO MAKE PLANS, I DEFINITELY LIKE TO JUST
KIND OF DO SOMETHING NOW OR NOT REALLY, I DON’T KNOW.

 WHAT MIGHT BE SOME IMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS THAT YOU SAY YOU HAVE?

 UHH… LIKE UHH… YESTERDAY I WAS DONE WATCHING A MOVIE AND I WAS GONNA
GO BACK AND GO TO SLEEP, BUT MY FRIEND CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO GO TO A
BAR AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT NOT GOING AND THEN I WAS LIKE EHH, I GUESS
I’LL GO. ENDED UP DOING THAT, I DON’T KNOW IF SOMEONE ASKS ME TO DO
SOMETHING AND I THINK IT SOUNDS FUN AT THE MOMENT, I’LL PROBABLY
DEFINITELY DO IT.

 ANY TATTOOS… I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE QUESTION?

 NO, I DON’T HAVE ANY TATTOOS.

 UHM, SPEEDING TICKETS…?

 I GOT ONE SPEEDING TICKET LIKE TWO YEARS AGO, BUT I DON’T KNOW I
DEFINITELY DRIVE QUICKER, BUT I DEFINITELY, I’M NOT LIKE A MANIAC, BUT…

 UHM, WHAT MOTIVATES YOU ON A DAILY BASIS?

 UHM, NOT WASTING MY LIFE I GUESS.

 YEAH

 NOT GETTING COMPLACENT LIKE I HATED WORKING MY 9-5 JOB. I’VE HAD A
TON OF JOBS THAT I HATED, SO HAVING A JOB THAT I ACTUALLY LIKE IS PRETTY
MOTIVATING. UHM… YEAH JUST GETTING THE MOST OUT OF LIFE BECAUSE I AM NOT
A REAL RELIGIOUS PERSON, SO I THINK THIS IS KIND OF LIKE THE ONE LIFE WE
GET SOO….WHY WASTE IT?

 DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT, UHH WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS THE MOST
CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S, WHETHER ITS HOLISTICALLY, OR WHETHER IT
WAS A SPECIFIC DAY OR EVENT…?

UHM, I DIDN’T FIND BUD/S TO BE THAT TOUGH.

 OKAY.

 I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT’S GONNA END NOT THAT FAR FROM NOW, SO…
WHAT EVER WE WERE IN LIKE THE PAIN WAS GONNA GO TO ANOTHER FORM OF PAIN
THAT I COULD HANDLE AND THAT WOULD GET REALLY BAD THEN I’D THINK IT’S
GOING TO BE SOME OTHER FORM OF PAIN AND IT NEVER REALLY GOT TOO BADLY I
DON’T THINK.

 YEAH, DID YOU, DID YOU THINK BIG PICTURE OR KIND OF LITTLE STEPS?

 LITTLE BITES…? UHHH, YEAH I DIDN’T REALLY THINK TOO FAR IN THE
FUTURE.

 YEAH…

 BUT I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IF I QUIT, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE I
QUIT AND THEN FIVE MINUTES LATER I’D SEE THE CLASS RUNNING SOMEWHERE
ELSE, DOING SOMETHING THAT LIKE...UHM, LIKE THAT I WOULD BE KICKING
MYSELF FOR QUITTING BECAUSE I DEFINITELY COULD HAVE MADE IT JUST FIVE
MORE MINUTES OR WHATEVER, UHM…

 WERE THERE EVERY ANYTIMES THAT YOU WANTED TO QUIT? LIKE SERIOUSLY
ACTUALLY CONSIDERED IT?

 UHH, NEVER ACTUALLY SERIOUSLY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT LIKE WHAT IF I
WERE TO QUIT RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD MY LIFE BE LIKE? BUT I NEVER REALLY
WAS LIKE “YEAH, I NEED TO QUIT RIGHT NOW,” YEAH.

 UHM, ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY THAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH BUD/S?

 UHH, JUST THIS IS THE LIFE I WANTED TO LIVE I GUESS, I MEAN I KIND OF
PUT IT OFF FOR SO LONG. I KIND OF EXPERIENCED ENOUGH WHERE I KNOW
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING WASN’T REALLY WHAT I SAW MYSELF DOING FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

 YEAH…

 AND THAT WAS DEFINITELY ENOUGH TO BE LIKE, “I DEFINITELY WANT TO PUT
EVERYTHING INTO THIS.” BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I DON’T REALLY, I’M NOT LIKE
SUPER PATRIOTIC OR SUPER RELIGIOUS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST THOUGHT
THE JOB SOUNDED AWESOME. I MEAN I DO THINKS ITS COOL LIKE KILLING BAD
GUYS AND WHAT NOT, PEOPLE THAT ARE DIRTBAGS, BUT UHH

 UHM, DO YOU FEEL THERE WAS SUPPORT IN THE GROUP, LIKE WAS THERE GROUP
SUPPORT IN YOUR CLASS OR WAS IT MORE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL?

 I BECAME FRIENDS WITH A LOT OF GUYS AND I DEFINITELY LIKE, WE HAD
SOME PRETTY FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT UHH, YEAH DEFINITELY DEFINITELY FEED OFF
EACH OTHER AS SUPPORT, BUT UHH, I DIDN’T REALLY HAVE ANY REAL CLOSE, I
WASN’T REALLY TOO CLOSE WHERE LIKE IF MY FRIEND QUIT LIKE ONE OF MY
FRIENDS, I HAD A FEW FRIENDS QUIT AND IT DIDN’T REALLY PHASE ME AT ALL…
LIKE IT WAS JUST KINDA LIKE BUMMER…

 KEEP GOING…

 THAT’S PART OF THE PROCESS, YOU KNOW?

 UHM, WERE THERE ANY SPECIFIC PRACTICES, I MEAN YOU SAID YOU WEREN’T
REALLY SPIRITUAL AT ALL, BUT ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC PRACTICES THAT YOU
USED OR PHYSICAL, MENTAL, OR SPIRITUAL THAT KIND OF HELPED YOU GET
THROUGH THIS PROCESS?

 UHM… I DID A LOT OF BOX BREATHING BEFORE EVENTS AND WHAT NOT, BUT NOT
REALLY LIKE DURING, UHM, I WOULD DEFINITELY TELL MYSELF POSITIVE THINGS
I’D SAY ON THE WHOLE LIKE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS DEFINITELY ENTERED MY MIND,
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO LIKE… JUST SMALL ONES I GUESS.

 YEAH… UHM, WERE THERE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE AT
BUD/S AND WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT
DECISION?

 UHM, I THINK ONE OF THE HARDER PARTS WAS WHEN I, I GUESS IT WASN’T SO
HARD...YOU…I DON’T KNOW, YOU KIND OF BECOME ANIMALISTIC AND UHH WHEN WE
WERE RUNNING BOAT ONE TIME, LIKE I STARTED SCREAMING AT OTHER PEOPLE
THAT I KNEW WERE NOT DOING THEIR PART.

 YEAH.

 BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST KIND OF LIKE LEECHING OFF THE GUYS THAT WERE
REALLY TRYING AND LIKE ONE KID FELL OUT AND IT KINKED MY NECK AND I
STARTED CURSING HIM OUT, I GOT ALL IN HIS FACE AND THEN HE QUIT, UHM,
BUT I DIDN’T REALLY FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE DESERVES TO
BE HERE SO

 ANY KIND OF ETHICAL OR MORAL TYPE OF DECISIONS YOU HAD TO MAKE?

 I DON’T REALLY BREAK THE RULES, JUST BECAUSE I WAS SCARED OF GETTING
DROPPED, SO NOTHING LIKE THAT, I NEVER REALLY CHEATED ON ANYTHING OR…
NOT IN ANYWAY LIKE THAT.

 OKAY, UHM, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL?

 UHM…. I THINK IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH GROWING UP WITH LIKE MY BROTHER
AND HIS FRIENDS.

 YEAH…

 UHM, I DON'T KNOW, WE’D, WE’D GET IN FIGHTS AND WHAT NOT, BUT UHH, I
DON’T KNOW, SOMETIMES I’D WIN, SO THAT WAS KIND OF FUNNY AT LEAST. UHH,
I DON’T KNOW, I THINK IT, I DON’T KNOW JUST GETTING BULLIED, BUT LIKE I
DON’T KNOW, IT WAS HARMLESS BULLYING, IT’S KIND OF WEIRD TO SAY, BUT I
THINK THAT HELPED A LOT.

 KIND OF SHAPED YOU A LITTLE BIT?

 YEAH, YEAH IT WAS GOOD.

 UHM, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT
VERSUS THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN’T MAKE IT?

 UHM, PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY?

 ANYTHING.

 UHM, I THINK SOMETIMES THE GUYS THAT WERE REALLY PHYSICALLY FIT LIKE
JUST GOT UHH, WHATS THE WORD, I DON’T KNOW GOT *SHORT PAUSE* GOT SHAKEN
UP BY THE FACT THEY WEREN’T PERFORMING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

 YEAH…

 UHM, WHERE A LOT OF GUYS THAT WEREN’T ALWAYS SUPER FIT KIND OF JUST
WERE USED TO THAT SORT OF THING, UHM, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY WERE
GETTING YELLED AT TO PERFORM OR WHAT NOT. THEY KIND OF JUST GUTTED IT
OUT, BUT, I DON’T KNOW, YOU COULD DEFINITELY JUST TELL LIKE SOME GUYS
LIKE MY ONE FRIEND WHO WAS JUST STARING BLANKLY IN A MIRROR ONE TIME AND
I WAS LIKE, “HEY MAN, YOU ALRIGHT?” AND HE LIKE DIDN’T EVEN ANSWER ME

 YEAH…

 AND I WAS JUST LIKE, LIKE HE JUST HAD LIKE YOU KNOW YOU COULD TELL
OUTWARDLY AFTER LIKE A LOGS SESSION OR WHAT NOT, HE WOULD BE LIKE, “MAN
THAT REALLY SUCKED” AND I WOULD BE LIKE LAUGHING KIND OF AND HE WAS JUST
LIKE, HE WOULDN’T RESPOND OR HE JUST WOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THAT
SUCKED. I WAS LIKE THAT SUCKED BUT THANK GOD WE’RE DOING SOMETHING ELSE
NOW, LIKE YOU KNOW IT’S BEHIND US NOW

 MOVED ON TO THE NEXT THING.

 YEAH, SO, I THINK THAT’S A BIG THING.

 OKAY WELL THE GOOD THING IS THIS IS NOW DONE, YOU’RE DONE WITH MY
EASY QUESTIONS COMPARED TO *INAUDIBLE*

UM I DIDN’T STOP. JUST KEPT GOING. MADE THE TIMELINES FOR THE EVOLUTIONS
AND WOKE UP EVERY DAY AND PUT MY UNIFORM ON

LET ME ASK THIS A DIFFERENT WAY- WHAT DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO LEFT? WHERE THERE ANY DIFFERENCES WHERE YOU COULD SAY “YEAH I KNEW
THAT GUY WAS GOING TO LEAVE”?

NO

REALLY?

YEAH. YEAH I MEAN SOME PEOPLE YEAH, OTHER PEOPLE NO. IT’S HARD TO SAY UM
I MEAN I WORKED WITH A LOT OF, UH THEY ARE CALLED BUDS DUDS, GUYS WHO
DON’T MAKE IT AND GO TO OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT. SO MY LAST JOB AS A RESCUE
SWIMMER, A LOT OF RESCUE SWIMMERS ARE GUYS FROM THIS PROGRAM. ALL GOOD-
MOST OF THEM ARE GOOD GUYS. UM I WOULD SAY SOME BETTER, SOME NOT. BUT
SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT GUYS IN THE CLASS

MHMM

IT’S HARD TO SAY UM I MEAN THEY ARE ALL DOING A JOB. I’M SURE THOSE GUYS
WILL PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR OTHER PEOPLE JUST LIKE THESE GUYS
WHO WILL

DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? GOING THROUGH
BUDS?

YES AND NO. UM I DON’T EVER THINK I AM EVER ANY DIFFERENT THAN WHO I WAS
WHEN I CAME HERE UH BUT I WOULD SAY I AM A BETTER PERSON I GUESS FOR
GOING THROUGH THIS, EXPERIENCING THIS

HOW HOW HOW ARE YOU BETTER?

UH JUST LEARNING MORE. EVERY DAY YOU LEARN MORE STUFF, LEARN MORE ABOUT
YOURSELF. I WOULDN’T SAY THOUGHT THAT’S JUST BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM.
IT’S JUST STRUGGLES. HARDSHIPS.

OKAY

EVERYONE CAN GO THROUGH STRUGGLES AND HARDSHIPS DIFFERENT PARTS OF LIFE

SO THE NAVY HIRED US TO TRY TO GET A GOOD FEEL FOR WHAT MAKES PEOPLE
GOOD CANDIDATES TO GO THROUGH BUDS SO THAT IT’S NOT SO HARD TO FIND
PEOPLE WHO FIT IN. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE ASKED YOU THAT WOULD HELP YOU,
HELP US UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT BUDS? LIKE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WERE
MISSING THAT WERE NOT EVEN ASKING AND YOU SAY “OH MY GOD IF YOU LOOKED
FOR THE PEOPLE WITH WHATEVER, THAT’S EASY TO SEE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO
MAKE IT”

UM I THINK BACKGROUND HAVE TO DO A LOT OF IT. KINDA LIKE THOSE QUESTIONS
OF WHAT YOU DID GROWING UP AND WHO YOU ARE KIND OF AS A PERSON BEFORE
YOU EVEN GET HERE RIGHT LIKE YOU WANT TO PROBABLY TRY AND ATTRACT GUYS
WITH GOOD MORAL COMPASSES, GOOD PAST EXPERIENCES, UM WHO HAVE ALREADY
BEEN THROUGH SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE AND HARDSHIP

OKAY

UM

BUT YOU SAID YOU DIDN’T REALLY GO THROUGH IT ANY HARDSHIPS BEFORE YOU
CAME HERE

WELL YOU GOT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS I DID RIGHT? SO LIKE EIGHT YEARS

FIREFIGHTER

TRYING TO BECOME AN EAGLE SCOUT, FIRE FIGHTER, SPORTS

BUT WOULD YOU SAY THEY WERE HARDSHIPS?

UM I WOULD SAY GROWING UP NOT BEING THAT SMART IN SCHOOL AND HAVING A
LEARNING DISABILITY SO THAT COULD BE A HARDSHIP OR

YEAH

OR JUST WORKING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE. UM I WOULDN’T SAY LIKE IT’S ANY
CRAZY KIND OF HARDSHIP BUT

BUT I IT’S INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY GOOD MORAL COMPASS. HOW DO YOU THINK
WE CAN TELL IF SOMEONE HAS A GOOD MORAL COMPASS?

UM

I I THINK THAT’S A GOOD THOUGHT

GETTING TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE WITHOUT NECESSARILY TALKING TO THE PERSON
BECAUSE SOMEBODY COULD TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. EVEN LIKE NOW
RIGHT? LIKE YOU ONLY YOU ONLY KNOW WHO I AM FROM WHAT IM TELLING YOU

EXACTLY

YOU WANNA KIND OF *UNINTELLIGIBLE* MAYBE YOUR FRIENDS. KINDA LIKE

LIKE WHAT DO YOUR SCOUT MASTER TYPE IN

YEAH KINDA LIKE

FIRE STATION

LOOK AT HOW THEY DO FOR SECURITY CLEARANCES, I KNOW THAT’S PROBABLY NOT
FEASIBLE BUT THAT’S PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO REALLY GET TO KNOW WHO
SOMEBODY IS.

YEAH THIS ALL WHAT WE CALL “SELF REPORT”. YOU’RE TELLING ME EVERYTHING
YOU WANT ME TO KNOW, YOU COULD

YEAH

MAKE UP SOMETHING TOTALLY

LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF ANY OF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT

YEAH, RIGHT

SO

AND WE ARE NOT GO VERIFY ANYTHING

EXACTLY

EITHER SO I’M GOING BY WHAT YOU TELL ME BECAUSE I’M HOPING THAT YOU HAVE
THE ALTRUISTICNESS THAT YOU WANT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE

YOU’RE HOPING I HAVE THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ALREADY

YES

OF THOSE *UNINTELLIGIBLE* THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

YES, ABSOLUTELY

I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IT’S KIND OF LIKE UM WHAT THEY ARE STARTING TO DO
WITH THE PROGRAM IS LOOK FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT AND KINDA

YUP

PUT THAT AT THE TOP RANK BECAUSE YOU COULD TEACH, IT’S EASY TO GET
SOMEONE TO RUN FASTER OR JUMP OR SWIM UM YOU KNOW IT’S KIND OF HARD
THOUGH TO REENGINEER 18 YEARS OF BEING *UNINTELLIGIBLE* SO TO SAY

YEAH

I MEAN A GUY THAT WOULD PICK UP TRASH YOU KNOW AS A 13 YEAR OLD BOY
SCOUT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

YEAH I DO. THANK YOU SO MUCH

NO PROBLEM

I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. THAT’S VERY HELP.
Alright the time is 0913 on 10Feb, this is CDR Ledford and I’m with
respondent 554, originally you were 141 initially you opted out and
then you came back in again which is great.. So are you good with me
recording this?

Of course

Alright, sooo this kind of gives us just some background about who you
are and what led you to this point, so I’ll give you some softball
questions initially. This year, what class did you start with?

334

338, oh 334?

Yes that was my original class

Alright, 334, and then what happened in 334?

Uh second week of first phase, went into buds medical, could hardly
stand uh had stress fractures in my tibia.

Stress fractures...and then what happened?

Uh I was in PTRR for uh 3, 2 and a half classes, uh classed back up
with 337

You were in PTRR for how long do you think you spent?

Fiiiive or six months?

5 or 6 months in PTRR… and then 337..?

337 I went all through all first phase with them, secured hell week,
got to second phase and failed for OC3

Failed OC3...and then?

Got a roll out of that and then classed back up with 338

So you started beginning of 338?

337

But you classed up with 338?

From uh second phase?

So you rolled in with them at second phase?

Yes.

Rolled into 338 at second phase?

Yes. and uh went through all second phase with 338, got uh one week
left of third phase

Holy cow.

And then got rolled out of there.

Oh my gosh, dude you got full benefit with this experience.

I... this is the full BUD/S experience.

Sick dude...third phase...last week… and then you went through a whole
third phase again?

Yes, another 5 mile swim… all that haha

So when did you start 334?

Uh October 2018

October 2018.. Jeez, that is awesome

Yeah its been quite the journey

That is crazy…thats a full BUD/S experience

My original class is graduated…

Yeah?

They are officially Navy SEALs

Well, you’re here

I’m here, that’s all that matters

How many siblings do you have?

I have one sister.

One sister..how old is she?

28.

28..How old are you?

I’m 21...in 3 weeks?

So it’s just the two of you.. Parents, married/divorced?

Uh Married.

Always married?

Yes

How are you with your parents?..close?

Oh yeah uh yeah...if a son could be closer...I think I talk to em every
day, at least 3 times a day…if I can

Looking back through your life, what kind of life-changing events shaped
you, any big influences?

Big influence..Running, I got into uh competitive running at a
s..somewhat early age and dropped all other sports for..for running..I
think that is the biggest influence which is its brought a lot of
success..and its really boosted my confidence and made me more like
strong...I’d say

You said made you headstrong, confidence?

Yeah I would say I was a above average runner for the early parts of my
running career and then uhh somethin actually I’d say I looked into, I
always wanted to be a SEAL, every since I was little kid I made like
guille suits, went out in the backyard and was just like shooting
airsoft and everything and then I looked into the program to see what it
was about my junior year...when I went into my junior year of high
school, and I was like “oh this looks pretty cool” and then ummm I
really started putting more effort into my running and then came out my
junior year track season with two state titles and uhh a high point
trophy from states and it was like awesome. I went to Kokora and
SEALFit, a camp that summer, aaand and that was a huge eye-opener..umm
and I came...I came from that, and the knowledge I gained from that put
into running and I won the following seasons cross country states as
well. To this day, I still follow that same mentality I had at that
point..

What do you think about your personality and how should we view it being
successful at BUD/S?

I always try and keep a good attitude, especially the amount of rolls
I’ve had, setbacks...always try and keep a good mentality….its not worth
it if you’re not having fun

How bout your background with friends, family, SEALs and the military?

Uh my uncle was Special Forces....my dad state police.

How bout your childhood umm your parents pretty strict but their
parenting style? Would you get spankings if you rebelled, timeouts?

Yeah timeouts spankings, uh got my car taken a couple times.

So you’d describe them..strict? Probably standard…

I’d say probably standard

How bout ummm did you have to move around a lot?

No, weee stayed uh, stay more in town all the time...not all the time
but..

Teenage years...team sports, ran, track, cross country..

Ran track and cross country

What about the 5 years leading up to BUD/s uh up to starting 334, what
did you do, walk me through uh what did you do those 5 years

So uhhh I was in high school uh

Did you go high school to Boot Camp right into BUD/S

I went to uh one year of college

Sooo one year of college...college where?

Uhh University of Alabama

Alright so your one year of college then..

2 weeks later

Just decided it was for you?

Yeah I had uh I was running down the, loved it, but not the running
part, I think that running collegiate made fall out of the love of
running and…

Really?

Uh went home for christmas leave er christmas break and uh was just
thinking...I’m just kinda sittin on the couch, lovin it I’m home with my
family, just thinkin there’s so many others...other guy other people who
can’t be at home right now. And so I looked into the military more at
that during christmas looking into it, and then that following semester
talked to a Navy recruiter, and said “hey.. I’m interested, I’m in”

Why the Navy recruiter right why didn’t you go Army like..SF?

Well it’s a funny story, I went into the Navy recruiter and I guess I
went a little to early.. They were closed and it started early and my
buddy dropped me off so I just kind stuck in the rain. The army
recruiter was uh open and he was like “hey wanna sit inside until your
buddy comes and picks you up?” and I was like “yeah I’d love to” and I
started talking to him and he was like “Do you have any family in? And I
said “yeah, uncle’s SF” and he said “You look like you’re pretty fit, do
you think you could go SF too?” and I was like “I don’t know my hearts
pretty set on uh being a SEAL” and he was like “ohh you’re betraying you
uncle right now.” and I was like “I am but I’m doing the cooler job
soo…” he was like “Alright you sure I can’t change your mind?” and I
said “I’m positive” so my buddy came and picked me up and the next day I
went to the Navy recruiter and then talked to him, got everything ready,
went two weeks after my first year just right to boot camp.

Why did you umm why did you think about the SEALs to begin with? Like is
it a book, is it a movie, is it friends or?

My uncle always told me cool stories, he did a couple of deployments
where he was uh with SEALs aaand so that’s that was crazy..crazy stuff
he told me, so as I kid I was always just pretending I’m a Navy SEAL,
Navy SEAL do all that stuff...I’d jump out of trees pretending I’m
jumping out of a plane. Everything I guess that kind of just
translated...up until I went to Kokoro

Yep

And SEALFit and I was like this this is what I wanna do.

Would you consider yourself impulsive?

Slightly

Do you have any tattoos?

I do not.

No tattoos..What do you think the most challenging part of BUD/S,
hardest day, hardest thing?

Getting rolled. I’d say getting rolled

One in particular was more devastating than the other ones?

Uh this past roll, getting my third phase roll, that was probably the
most heart-wrenching one...getting so close and just getting sent all
the way back, especially knowing everything you have to redo. That was,
the anticipation was devastating.

That is tough. Yeah it’s one thing to get rolled at the beginning yeah
of phase

And then you don’t know anything and

Yeah

Going all the way through it’s just like you have so much to look
forward to.

What motivated you?

Uh just my buddies… they helped me out so much. They helped me out uh my
parents helped me out. And then resetting myself to the point of okay
you’ve, you’ve already done it before, you can do it again, and just
saying it doesn’t matter the path, just the destination, and so it was
like let’s go get it again, I thought that was that was definitely the
hardest role, the hardest part I’d say

What about practices, did you do anything during the day? Like mental
practices, physical, spiritual practices that helped you stay?

Uhhh I’d say just more meditation, um

And when?

Uh everyday I’d get back, this was uh, I started this in 2nd Phase.
Every day I would just, I’d set aside 5 minutes, and I’d put I’d put my
headphones on, they’re noise cancelling so they’d just block everything
out and I would just sit there and think about what happened that day,
anything that could be done and if I could have done just what would
have been the better route, just kind of just repeat each day and just
have that reset every day

So you you did that pretty consistently 5 minutes after second phase?

Yeah, I’d say I’d say every day, other than weekends I’d I’d say every
day

Did you come across a difficult decision at all that you had to make uh
something that you really struggled through BUD/S, running classmates
out, or turning in a cheating classmate or someone, that you really
struggled with?

No, I’d say, well there’s one instance in 37 we had a guy who uh skipped
an obstacle on the O-course, and we all talked to him about it, and just
said hey like he knew that it was a wrong mistake, did it anyways, we
all confronted about it saying like “you know what you did” um but I
think that was the furtherst I got with it, was just confronting..

And what happened?

Umm, our officers, they took hold of it and brought it up to the cadre,
and he’s not he’s not in the program anymore. I think that was probably
the, in relative to those situations I think that was probably the
hardest part, because he I liked him a lot, he was a good guy but.. You
just can’t do that stuff.

What do you think made you successful going through BUD/S?

That’s a tough question… uhhh a good support system is is huge. You
definitely need that. Umm just I’d say that reset every day. Resetting
yourself every day, and just kind of tackling the whole day. Tackling
each portion of the day I’d say, every meal one meal at a time.

Is there anything about the people who are not here anymore, the
quitters, the people who got rolled, what’s different about them?

Umm I’d ss, I keep up with a lot of a lot of the guys that left the
program, got kicked out of the program, I keep up them them. And I think
they’re still the same guys I went to boot camp with and classed up with
and a little more sad, you can tell, but overall they’re still hungry
they just…

Is there any difference though between them and the guys that made it?

Mmm no, they’re still goofy guys, still goofy guys, they’re just the
ones that didn’t make it, so..

How about uhh [unintelligable]like has this changed you in any way?

Yes, uhh more mature. Umm I definitely take caution with every step I
take. And I wouldn’t say it’s like a mixture of kind of tunnel vision
and kind of open view, I’d say uh when I’m tackling something I keep
that tunnel vision but when you take that step back you still have to
take everything in

Anything else you feel like made a difference that I should be asking
you?

I think it’s just… keeping your head up. Keeping your head up and
remembering why you’re here, why you decided to jump in, how you see
yourself in the future, if you can look at yourself in the mirror and
still see the same person.

Alright thank you

Thank you

I appreciate it. Have fun going forward it was awesome this was great
we’ll stop there

This was cool

Yeah this was great dude

IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING, OK, AND I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN IS IT OK IF I
RECORD?

THAT’S FINE.

AND WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL US YOUR PARTICIPANT I.D. NUMBER?

FIVE FIVE SEVEN.

AWESOME. OK. SO WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S CLASS?

MY ORIGINAL CLASS WAS 334. WE GOT HERE OCTOBER 1ST, 2018. BEEN IN THE
PROGRAM FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW THEN. AND THEN UHH

AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME GOING THROUGH BUD/S?

YES.

 (SIO): SO LET'S GO BACK TO YOUR FAMILY.
ARE YOU AN ONLY CHILD, DO YOU HAVE SIBLINGS?

I HAVE FOUR SIBLINGS.

WOW, OK.

YEAH. OLDER BROTHER IS 24, THEN ME, JUST TURNED 22. I HAVE A YOUNGER
BROTHER WHO’S TWENTY. THEN TWO SISTERS, THEY’RE 18 AND 14.

AND ARE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPERATED, DIVORCED?

YES. MARRIED.

HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN MARRIED?

PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE TO 26 YEARS.

WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH THEM?

I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS.

AND YOUR SIBLINGS AS WELL?

WITH MY SIBLINGS, YES. WE ALL GET ALONG.

 SO HAVE THERE BEEN ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE
PRIOR TO BUD/S?

MY DAD WAS HOMESCHOOLED ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH
SCHOOL, AND I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS, GRADUATED AND I WENT
TO COLLEGE FOR TWO YEARS. I KNEW WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT I WANTED
TO COME TO THIS. BUT MY CROSS COUNTRY COACH AT THE TIME, I WAS VERY
CLOSE WITH AND WHO WAS KIND OF LIKE A MENTOR TO ME. I WANTED TO KIND OF
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS TRAINING AND ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF GUYS WHO
DO WELL. SO HE CONTACTED ONE OF THE NSW SCOUTS AND FOUND OUT THAT
TYPICALLY THE GUYS WHO SUCCEED ARE LIKE IN THEIR YOUNG 20S. HIGH
SCHOOLERS DON'T NORMALLY DO SO HOT. SO. SO HE SUGGESTED TO ME, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HOLD OFF, DON'T ENLIST RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, MAYBE GET A
COUPLE OF YEARS OF LIFE EXPERIENCE OR NOT. GET A LITTLE STRONGER, A
LITTLE MORE MENTALLY, MORE RESILIENT. SO I TOOK THAT ADVICE ON BOARD AND
DID A COUPLE OF YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE JUST TO STAY BUSY. AND THEN
OVER THOSE SUMMERS, I WOULD GO AND KIND OF DO SOMETHING OUT OF MY
COMFORT ZONE. SO ONE SUMMER, I WENT AND WORKED AT THE SUMMER CAMP IN
YOSEMITE. SO GOING INTO THAT, I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE THERE, HAD NEVER BEEN
TO THAT PART OF CALIFORNIA BEFORE, BUT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FUN
EXPERIENCE. AND I THOUGHT IT KIND OF PUSHED ME TO BE BETTER AT ADAPTING
TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS.

SO, AND DO YOU THINK THAT WAS EFFECTIVE?

 SO, HOW DID THOSE EXPERIENCES FACTOR INTO, OR THAT EXPERIENCE
FACTOR INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE NOW?

I THINK IT WAS EFFECTIVE. I THINK, I THINK, I _CHANGED A BIT,_ MOST
PEOPLE DO THOSE COUPLE YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. AND I THINK THAT I THINK
THAT I DID BETTER AS A RESULT. I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF I WANT TO COME HERE AS 19 YEAR OLD, BUT I'M GLAD THAT I MADE
THAT_-_

-MORE MATURE AND GETTING COMFORTABLE?

YEAH. YEAH. AND THEN JUST LEARNING INDEPENDENCE AND MAKING MY OWN
DECISIONS, BEING AWAY FROM HOME.

 UHM, HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

PERSONALITY MEANING…?

SO, YEAH, ARE THOSE TRAITS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU, AND ARE PREDICTABLE
BEHAVIOR, SO IT COULD BE OPENNESS TO IDEAS, CONSCIENTIOUSNESS,
EXTROVERSIONS OR INTROVERSION, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND AGREEABLENESS,

RIGHT.

LIKE HOW YOU DEAL WITH STRESS, OR ANXIETY.

I THINK I'M DEFINITELY INTROVERTED. SO... YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT
OF A GRIND BEING AROUND ALL THESE DUDES, ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, THINGS
LIKE ON THE ISLAND WERE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME. THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY
FROM THEM. BUT BUT I TEND TO ALSO BE PRETTY AGREEABLE. I DON'T GET ANGRY
VERY EASILY. AND MAYBE AS A RESULT OF GROWING UP WITH SO MANY SIBLINGS,
PRETTY PATIENT. YES. AND YOU CAN KIND OF TAKE THINGS IN STRIDE. SO I
DON'T THINK I REALLY HAVE ANY ENEMIES IN THE CLASS… I HAVEN'T GONE OFF
ON TOO MANY PEOPLE_-_

-EVEN KEEL.

RIGHT. I LIKE TO BE CALM AND GET ALONG WITH OTHERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

 SO, DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND TO BECOMING PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY
DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY OR FRIENDS?

NO, NOT REALLY. MY UNCLE WAS IN THE AIR FORCE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND MY
GRANDFATHERS WERE BOTH IN THE NAVY LONG TIME AGO. BUT YES, I THINK SINCE
I WAS A KID, I WANTED TO GO TO THE MILITARY. IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO
ME. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I KNEW I WANTED TO PURSUE. I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE SEALS UNTIL I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WATCHED THE MOVIE
LONE SURVIVOR. SO I WAS I WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL TO ME. I WATCHED IT WITH
MY BEST FRIEND AT THE TIME. AND THEN AFTER THE MOVIE ENDED, I WATCHED IT
AND I TOLD THEM I'M GOING TO DO THAT. AND HE STARTED LAUGHING. HE WAS
LIKE, ARE YOU CRAZY? LIKE EVERYONE IN THAT MOVIE DIED, LIKE, THAT WAS
VERY UNPLEASANT. AND UH, BUT I KNEW. I KNEW PRETTY MUCH SINCE I SAW THAT
LATER, SOME RESEARCH I DID. I WAS REALLY DRAWN TO THE UNITY THAT I SAW
IN THE GUYS THAT WERE IN THAT MOVIE, HOW THEY WERE FACING AN INCREDIBLY
NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE, YOU KNOW, OVERWHELMING FORCE. THEY ALL KIND
OF KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. AND YET THEY DIDN'T TURN ON ONE
ANOTHER. THEY DIDN'T GO EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF, THEY STAYED TOGETHER.
THEY FOUGHT TILL THE END AND, I KNEW I KNEW I WANTED TO GO TO THE
MILITARY. AND I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO BE PART OF A BROTHERHOOD LIKE THAT
WHERE IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT WAS HAPPENING. GUYS WERE THERE FOR EACH
OTHER. SO THAT WAS KIND OF WHAT FIRST TURNED ME ON TO THIS PROGRAM. THEN
QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH ON MY OWN, AND EVENTUALLY I ENDED UP GOING FOR
IT.

BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

STEPFATHER

STEPFATHER?

YEAH...AND UH THAT INTROVERTED SIDE OF ME HAS ALWAYS, I’VE ALWAYS LONGED
FOR A COMMUNITY.

ARE YOU ENLISTED OR OFFICER?

I’M ENLISTED

ENLISTED.

 SO GOING BACK TO YOUR FAMILY, AND. CHILDHOOD, WE'RE INTERESTED IF
YOU COULD DESCRIBE YOUR PARENTS LIKE THEIR PARENTING STYLE SO UH,
DISCIPLINE, WERE YOU SPANKED AS A LITTLE KID UH, FREE RANGE PARENTING?

I'VE SPANKED AS A KID, BUT MY PARENTS WOULD ALWAYS SIT ME DOWN
AFTERWARDS AND LET ME KNOW WHY. SO IT WAS NEVER YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEVER
ANY AMBIGUITY ABOUT IT. I ALWAYS KNEW WHAT THE REASON FOR MY PUNISHMENT
WAS. SO, YOU KNOW, TYPICALLY WHEN I WAS MAKING DECISIONS, I KNEW WHETHER
I WAS GOING TO BE DISCIPLINED FOR IT. OTHER THAN THAT, THOUGH, MY
PARENTS WERE FAIRLY HANDS OFF, ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, MY MOM WOULD KIND
OF.. SHE WASN'T LIKE HELICOPTER PARENT. LIKE, I REMEMBER WE'D GO TO THE
PLAYGROUND AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS OR MOMS WOULD BE LIKE, HEY, YOU KNOW,
BE CAREFUL ON THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. LIKE, DON'T WALK ON TOP OF THE
MONKEY BARS. THAT TYPE OF THING FROM MY MOM WAS NEVER LIKE THAT. YEAH.
SHE'S LIKE, IF YOU WALK ON TOP OF THE MONKEY BARS AND YOU FALL, YOU
KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO GET HURT. AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN. SO IF YOU DO THAT AND YOU GET HURT, I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL BAD
FOR YOU. SO SHE WOULD, YOU KNOW, JUST JUST LET US GO AND DO THE THINGS
WE WANTED TO DO.

FAIL IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT?

_[35]_ YEAH. SHE KNEW WE WEREN'T GOING TO DIE FALLING OFF THE
MONKEY BARS, BUT WE DECIDED TO DO THAT AND GOT HURT. THAT'S OUR FAULT.
SO, YEAH, IT'S JUST KIND OF MAINTAIN THAT ATTITUDE. AND EVEN NOW HERE
SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT ME BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT I MADE THE
DECISION TO COME HERE AND I'M AWARE OF THE RISKS INVOLVED.

 DID YOU MOVE AROUND IN YOUR CHILDHOOD?

NO, NOT AT ALL. I WAS BORN IN A HOUSE THAT I GREW UP IN. SO LIKE A HOME
BIRTH. AND I LIVE THERE. ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL GRADE SCHOOL-

-SO YOU WERE HOMESCHOOLED?

NO, NOT AT ALL. I WAS BORN IN A HOUSE THAT I GREW UP IN. SO LIKE A HOME
BIRTH. AND I LIVE THERE. ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL GRADE SCHOOL. HOMESCHOOLED
UP UNTIL SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,
EVEN WHEN I WOULD TAKE OFF OVER THE SUMMERS, I STILL CAME BACK TO THAT
HOUSE. AND THAT'S. I WAS UNTIL I LEFT THE GROUP CAMP IN MAY OF 2018.

 AND SO, DID YOU SEE ANY TEAM SPORTS OR ACTIVITIES?

IN HIGHSCHOOL, DID TRACK AND CROSS COUNTRY. SO PEOPLE THAT I MET ON
THOSE TEAMS AND MY COACH WERE REALLY POSITIVE. AND UH, I LOVE DOING
SPORTS.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO COMING TO BUD/S
YOU MENTIONED, WHAT WAS IT, TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE?

YES TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND ALSO, AT THAT TIME, I WAS
WORKING AS A SERVER AT A RESTAURANT, AND THEN _O_VER THE SUMMER, ONE
SUMMER, I WENT TO SUMMER CAMP AND WORKED THERE, AND THEN OTHER SUMMER I
WORKED AT SAN DIEGO COUNTY FAIR. I GOT AN AUNT WHO LIVES. IN ENCINITA SO
I STAYED AT HER HOUSE OVER THE SUMMER.

 WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

UMMM, GENERALLY, NO.

OK, SO DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS YOU GOT ON A WHIM, SPEEDING TICKETS, BIG
PURCHASES?

NOT REALLY. I LIKE TO LIKE TO TYPICALLY BE PRETTY INFORMED ABOUT THE
CHOICES I'M GOING TO MAKE. AND I LIKE TO DO MY RESEARCH BEFOREHAND. I
DON'T REALLY MAKE ANY IMPULSE PURCHASES OR MAKE ANY PERMANENT DECISIONS
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND.

 SO, THINKING ABOUT BUD/S, WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF
BUD/S? SO, A DAY, EVENT, OR IT COULD BE JUST A THEME LIKE, LOGS, OR
WATER?

ALL THAT STUFF'S CHALLENGING, CERTAINLY. BUT I THINK FOR ME, SO I WAS,
UH, ORIGINALLY THREE, FOUR, AND THEN I GOT ROLLED IN HELL WEEK, FOR A
COUPLE OF INJURIES... AND I THINK KIND OF MAKING THE DECISION TO STAY
MENTALLY IN THE GAME AND COME BACK WITH THE CLASS THAT I ENDED UP COMING
BACK WITH THREE THREE SEVEN. THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE
I'D BEEN PRETTY MUCH ALL THE WAY THROUGH FIRST PHASE, GONE THROUGH, YOU
KNOW, A REALLY CHALLENGING SELECTION AND REALIZING THAT I WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO START BACK. THEY WON AND NO ONE CARED ABOUT WHAT I HAD ALREADY
FINISHED. THAT WAS REALLY HARD. ALREADY HAVING SEEN BEHIND THE CURTAIN
KNOWING THAT ALL THAT WAS COMING.

 WHAT KEPT YOU GOING THROUGH THAT CHALLENGE?

I THINK JUST THE RESOLUTION I HAD ALREADY MADE THAT THIS IS WHERE I
WANTED TO BE AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I WAS I WAS STILL WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER I HAD TO DO TO MAKE IT. BUT IT WAS NOT AN EASY THING TO ACCEPT.

SO YOU HAD MADE A COMMITMENT?

YES.

TO YOURSELF?

YES, MYSELF AND I TOLD MY FAMILY I WAS DOING THIS. MY REPUTATION IS
REALLY IMPORTANT. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TELLING MY PARENTS SAYING, YOU
KNOW, IT'S TOO HARD.

OK

 SO NOW WE'RE GETTING THE INTERNAL MOTIVATION AND EXTERNAL FACTORS.
DID YOU FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

YES. YES. I HAD SOME FRIENDS, BOTH IN A PREVIOUS CLASS AND MY CLASSES
AHEAD OF ME TWO THAT WERE REALLY ENCOURAGING AND HELPED ME... SORT OF
DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING TO COME BACK. A COUPLE OF GUYS WHO ARE
IN THIS CLASS NOW, ACTUALLY, WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN ROLLED FROM 334, FOR
INJURIES OR WHATEVER, THAT THEY HAD SUSTAINED DURING FIRST PHASE. I KNEW
I WAS GOING TO BE CLASSING UP WITH THEM. SO IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE THEM
AROUND DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS ROLLED.

 DID YOU HAVE ANY PRACTICES LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL, THAT
YOU USED TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

YES, I'M A STRONG CHRISTIAN, SO I PRAY QUITE A BIT. AND ALSO KIND OF A
WEIRD LITTLE SAYING, BUT, UH SOMETHING THAT WOULD JUST HELP ME STAY
FOCUSED. AS I WOULD JUST SAY, THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. YOU
KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT WAS GOING ON, IF MY MIND STARTED TO WANDER AND I
STARTED TO WONDER, LIKE, HEY, YOU KNOW, IT'S PRETTY SWEET IF I WEREN'T
OUT HERE IN THE SEARCH ZONE RIGHT NOW. I WOULD JUST REPEAT MYSELF, "THIS
IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW". IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I COULD BE DOING.
THIS IS WHAT I AM DOING. JUST HELP ME CALM, STAY GROUNDED IN THE PRESENT
MOMENT_._

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING, WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE
OF A DECISION THAT YOU REALLY STRUGGLED WITH DURING BUD/S? SO, FOR
EXAMPLE, RUNNING A CLASSMATE OUT, OR TURNING THEM IN FOR CHEATING?

YEAH, THERE'S A COUPLE COUPLE OF DIFFICULT POINTS... THERE'S A GOOD
FRIEND OF MINE AND FIRST PHASE WHO WE RAN OUT OF OUR BOAT. REALLY LIKED
HIM AS A PERSON. BUT UH, YOU KNOW, WASN'T... WASN'T ABLE TO KEEP UP AND
OTHER GUYS IN THE BOAT WAS SAYING SOME REALLY NEGATIVE THINGS TO HIM.
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE WORDS THEY WERE SAYING WERE REALLY REFLECTIVE
OF WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE HAD SHOWN US ABOUT HIMSELF, UP UNTIL THAT
POINT. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, HE WAS BORN THIS WAY. SO I DIDN'T
PERSONALLY SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE TO HIM, BUT IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO
SEE HIM TAKE THAT NEGATIVITY FROM THE OTHER GUYS IN THE CREW.

SO WHAT GOT YOU THROUGH THE DECISION TO SAY, HE’S GOT TO GO, WE GOT TO
TAKE ACTION?

THERE'S A PERFORMANCE STANDARD AND AT A CERTAIN- MOST OF THE TIME WE'LL
TRY TO HELP ONE ANOTHER. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LACKING IN ONE AREA, BUT AT A
CERTAIN POINT, YOU SEE A GUY GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. AND IF YOU CAN'T HELP
HIM BRING HIMSELF TO THE STANDARD AND HE'S GIVEN UP ON HIMSELF AND HE'S
DONE UP HERE, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN HIM. AND I CAN SEE THAT HE WAS HE WAS
OUT.

SO THAT'S... KIND OF, WHAT’S THE GREATER GOOD OF THE TEAM?

YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE BOAT IS PULLING THEIR
WEIGHT.SO YOU DON’T WANT THEM TO GET HURT.

BEST FOR THE TEAM.

 WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

I THINK I PROBABLY SOME GUYS HAVE MENTIONED SENSE OF HUMOR IS IMPORTANT.
I THINK THAT'S A SMALL PART OF A BIGGER STRATEGY. I THINK THE REASON
THAT I'M STILL HERE IS JUST THE ABILITY TO SEGMENT AND COMPARTMENTALIZE
MY MIND. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY ANY EVOLUTION IN DOING THIS
PROGRAM THAT EVERY GUY WHO SHOWS UP TO CORONADO COULD COMPLETE. I THINK,
I THINK EVERYONE WHO HAS GOTTEN A CONTRACT AND MADE IT HERE COULD DO
EVERY EVOLUTION FROM THE PROGRAM. BUT IT'S WHEN YOU START TO OVERWHELM
YOURSELF WITH, "I'M DOING THIS, WHICH SUCKS". AND THEN AFTER THIS, I
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING AND I KNOW THAT'S HARD. AND THEN WE HAVE A NIGHT
EVOLUTION, SO I'M NOT GOING GET MUCH SLEEP TONIGHT. AND THEN TOMORROW IS
A REALLY CHALLENGING THING. AND YOU START TO JUST STRETCH WHAT YOUR MIND
RUN AWAY. AND THOSE GUYS END UP JUST QUITTING ON SOMETHING THAT, YOU
KNOW, THEY COULD EASILY FINISH. SO I THINK UH-

SO, THEY TALKED THEMSELVES OUT OF IT BEFORE THEY EVEN STARTED?

SO I THINK I'M STILL HERE JUST BECAUSE YOU TAKE THINGS ONE DAY AT A TIME
AND KIND OF MAKE LIGHT OF PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

 IS THERE ANYTHING, UH ACTUALLY, HAS THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU?

ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING IS PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IT MEANS TO
SUFFER. I FEEL I FEEL A LOT OLDER THAN I AM JUST BECAUSE WHEN I'M IN AN
AREA WITH PEERS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, WE GO DOWNTOWN OR SOMETHING AND
YOU'RE AROUND, THE 20 YEAR OLD YEAR OLDS INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WAY THAT WE HAVE AND THEY HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. WE'VE KIND OF GOTTEN A GLIMPSE OF THAT
THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH. WE REALIZE THAT OUR
POTENTIAL IS INCREDIBLE, BUT THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH. NO IDEA HOW HARD IT CAN RISE. SO I THINK THE
BIGGEST THING THAT'S CHANGED ABOUT ME IS MY WEIRDNESS OF WHAT YOU CAN DO
WHEN YOU REALLY SET YOUR MIND TO SOMETHING. WHAT'S POSSIBLE.

OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT YOU THINK
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO OUR STUDY INVESTIGATING THIS IDEA OF RESILIENCE,
HEARTINESS, AND MINDFULNESS?

NO, I DON’T THINK SO, I THINK YOU’RE OFF TO A GREAT SEVERAL QUESTIONS.

OK, SO STOP.

WHEN DID YOU START YOUR BUD/S CLASS AND IS THIS YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE?
WHO DID YOU START WITH?

My first BUD/S experience, yes. But, I started with class 337.

THEN YOU ROLLED TO 338 OR DID YOU SKIP RIGHT TO 339?

No, end of 38 and then 39.

HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

One older sister and one younger sister.

WERE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED, SEPARATED OR DIVORCED?

Uhh.. Married until right before I left for the Navy.

SO YOU WERE 18, 19?

18

WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM?

Uhh.. me and my mom are super close, me and my dad had a little bit of a
rough patch, I guess you could call it, its getting better again.

DID YOU HAVE ANY LIFE CHANGING EVENTS PRIOR TO BUD/S? WHATEVER YOU THINK
IS LIFE CHANGING.

Uhh… not really that I could recall.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK PROGRESSED YOU THROUGH BUD/S?
WHAT HELPED YOU?

Uhh.. being stubborn, probably. Seems to be a pretty common theme.

WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO BE A SEAL, DID YOU WATCH A MOVIE, KNOW SOMEONE IN
THE MILITARY? HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT?

Uhh.. I was pretty young, maybe about 8 or 9 and we were at its called a
balloon fiesta in Mexico and the leap frogs actually jumped in and
landed and I was like that looks super cool and then and my dad taught
me about a little bit more of what they actually did and that was just
kind of like part of like their shore duty so I learned more from that
way and from then on I was pretty set.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, HOW DID YOUR PARENTS DISCIPLINE YOU? DID
THEY GIVE YOU A TIME OUT, DID THEY MAKE YOU DO PUSH UPS, DID THEY SPANK
YOU?

Uhh.. I got spankings when I was younger and then I guess as I got older
they’d take my phone and ground me kind of deal.

AND THEN DID YOU MOVE A LOT AS YOU WERE GROWING UP?

No

THEN TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS, WERE YOU ON TEAM SPORTS OR WERE
YOU WITH A TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY WITH CHURCH OR BOY SCOUTS OR...?

I played football and baseball since T-ball since I was super young and
then once I got into highschool kind of started to playing around, I did
track, and powerlifting, and basketball.

WERE ANY OF THOSE TEAMS LIKE REALLY TIGHT?

Uhh.. our football team was

AND THEN WHAT DID YOU DO IN LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?
DID YOU FINISH HIGHSCHOOL?

I did.

AND THEN WHAT?

So I uhm.. Five years ago I was in 8th grade.

OKAY SO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL YOU ENLISTED RIGHT AWAY?

Yeah

DID YOU ENLIST FOR THE SEALS?

Yes

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE IMPULSIVE? LIKE YOUR DECISION TO JOIN
THE SEALS HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT OR DID YOU JUST DECIDE TO DO
IT?

Uhm… I had thought about it but deep down I had known that is what I
wanted to do. I guess kind of a little bit of both I uh, from that day
uhh I knew yeah I wanted to try to do it but then I guess I kind of
doubted myself along the way some so I uhh thought against it or weighed
the options but.

OKAY, SO DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS OR KIND OF BINGE DRINK OR ANYTHING LIKE
THAT?

No

OKAY SO YOU’RE NOT REALLY IMPULSIVE.

OKAY SO THINK ABOUT YOUR HARDEST DAY AT BUD/S? WHAT WAS THAT?

Uhh… Probably getting rolled for the second time

WHAT HELPED YOU OR MOTIVATED YOU THROUGH THAT?

Uhh… Having people that I was pretty close with already get rolled at
the same time and just knowing, yeah I am not with my original class or
it's another 8 months or 8 weeks that we have to go through training. In
the end we're all going to the same bowl

DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP WHEN YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH THAT HARD TIME?

Yes

DID YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PRACTICES YOU DID TO HELP GET THROUGH THOSE
TIMES LIKE MEDITATION OR PRAYING OR BREATHING?

If anything it was just going out with my friends and eating or hanging
out at the beach.

DID YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS YOU HAD TO MAKE GOING THROUGH
BUD/S? LIKE TURNING A CLASSMATE FOR CHEATING OR NOT DOING WHAT HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO?

Uhh… No not in our class.

WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

Uhh… Probably the biggest thing was because I couldn’t call my mom and
tell her that I..

I LOVE THAT ANSWER

That was one of the biggest things.

LET ME ASK IT A DIFFERENT WAY, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT
THE PEOPLE WHO WOUND UP QUITTING? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT BETWEEN YOU AND
THEM, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE AND THE PEOPLE THAT AREN’T?

Uhh… It’s tough cause I still have some friends that have quit and still
talk to

OH I AM NOT SAYING THEY ARE BAD PEOPLE, I AM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

Oh no I know, right, but like I don’t know, I feel like with some of the
guys that I was friends with before they quit were pretty much the same
and had a bunch of the same like backstory and grew up kind of the same
but then there is other people that are completely different and made it
through. It’s hard to kind of pinpoint.

OKAY, HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON?

Uhh I definitely matured a lot, especially coming right after high
school. It’s made me kind of grow up and open my eyes to the world a
little bit.

YEAH WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I DIDN’T ASK THAT

I am from Texas

WHERE IN TEXAS?

Small town outside of San Antonio. About 45 minutes outside the city.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I SHOULD’VE ASKED YOU THAT I DIDN’T THAT YOU
THINK WOULD HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO MAKES A GOOD BUD/S CANDIDATE?

I don’t know, it’s…

IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO YOUR HIGH SCHOOL AND GIVE A TALK ABOUT WHAT
IT’S LIKE TO BE A SEAL, WHAT WOULD YOU BE LOOKING FOR IF YOU WERE TO
INTERVIEW PEOPLE TO SEE IF THEY WERE SUITABLE FOR BUD/S?

I think I’ve been told everything you really need to know about BUD/S,
it’s not physically that demanding but it really is all just the mental
game and it really just depends on how bad you want to be here, if you
don’t want to be here… you’re not gonna stick around for the beatings
and being cold, but if you do wanna be here it’s all worth it in the
end.

Okay, is it okay if I record the interview?

Yup.

Great your participant IDs are 68 and 380.

 So easy questions first, when did you start BUD/s?

Uhh do you mean like date or class?

Class.

338.

And when did you move into 339?

Uhh so in second phase uhh right after OC8 or Pool Comp, like midway
through, uhh, they didn’t have enough drager rigs for everyone uhh we
were like seven guys heavy and they admin rolled it wasn’t like
performance or medical roll it was like uhh too many people sorta
thing. SO uhh they picked seven guys based on performance like uhh I’m
not great at running or like swimming. I’m like one of the lower
performers on that uhh so they chose seven of those guys uhh for 339
but.

Okay.

So that’s how I got rolled.

That’s kinda tough haha.

Yeah haha.

Umm well we’ll talk about that more umm.

 SO siblings, let’s talk about how many siblings you have.

I have three.

Okay threAnd whats the birth order?

Umm I’m actually a twin.

Oh really?

He’s actually uhh at BUD/S with me.

Is he?

He’s not in my class anymore, but hes uhh he got rolled from 340. He’s
in second phase right now.

Okay great, so hes in 340?

Uhh he was.

Oh he’s in 341?

He got hurt so he’s, I’m not sure what class he’s in.

Okay. That’s interesting so are you guys the oldest out of the?

Yes uhh. We’re both 19.

 And then uhh, whats the younger sibling order?

She’s 15 right now and then the middle she’s uhh, she just turned 18.

Okay.

Two sisters and one brother.

Okay so brother. And how old are your sisters again?

The middle one she’s uhh 18.

Okay.

And the younger one is 15.

 Okay great ummm. And then parents, are your parents together?

Yes.

 And that’s same your whole life?

Yup.

 And what’s your relationship like with your parents?

Uhh it’s a great, great uhh relationship. My dad’s actually a SEAL.

Is he, okay?

My mom’s a nurse umm uhh we, I was born in San Diego uhh been here my
entire life uhh I, I love my parents. They uhh my dad teaches me a
lot, like he’s uhh I think he’s really proud. My mom she’s uhh she
raised us like she was a nurse and then she left that for a bit uhh
raised until about four years ago and then got back into it. SHe went
to college again.

Okay great.

 And is your dad still in the military?

Uhh he retired about a year and a half ago.

Okay but you guys got to stay here the whole time? Okay great.

 Okay now umm was he gone a lot?

He was until I think about like 9. I think the last deployment he went
on was about 10 years ago.

Okay.

Ever since then he’s done uhh little trips here and there, but uhh
he’s predominately been here.

Okay great.

At home.

 SO have you gotten to be like uhh here at this training zone
prior to all this?

I uhh he didnt, he didnt really tell me much, but I , I’ve been on
this base before a ton as a kid when I was like 11. Umm I did like uhh
a big part of why I like or uhh wanted to be a part of this is this is
because how I grew up umm I grew up around military. Like my grandpa,
my Dad’s dad he’s a green beret. My mom’s dad was my age when he got
drafted into Vietnam.

Okay

Umm just something I knew I wanted to do umm it. Like exposure umm i
think umm like I’ve definitely been around like a lot of SEALs I think
thats a lot of the reason why I wanted to do it.

Well talk about umm, I’ll ask you all the later questions so we’ll
hold off I’ll you about that later haha.

 ANy life changing events happen prior to coming to BUD/S? Either
positive or negative?

Umm like death or anything?

Yeah, I mean like they could even be positive like something that
stands out in your mind.

Not really, I mean umm uhh I can’t really think of anything uhh i mean
uhh, even joining the Navy that was a rough time uhh. Me and my
brother couldnt get in uhh we got disqualified from MEPs. Uhh so when
I graduated high school in 2018 I just, me and my brother were just in
limbo til like half a year, trying to get in like it was medical umm
we both had like childhood asthma as a kid uhh they gave us a lot of
problems for that uhh and it was like uhh like I didnt know what to do
because I’ve wanted to do this for so long umm so it was a rough time
I think so uhh all I could think of.

Yeah.

 SO with that you both were struggling to get the medical
clearances, I mean what were you doing while you were waiting for all
that?

Uhh I got a job. I worked at a restaurant, My brother was working at
uhh Walls, we were just working out uhh going to work. About it uhh.
It was definitely tough uhh really rough. My mom was uhh telling me
you gotta sign up for college and I knew I wanted to come here and I
got uhh a scholarship to go to SDSU umm I kinda like gave that up to
come here. Finding out that I couldn't join was really uhh
disheartening for me.

 SO what kinda got you to get the clearances to come..

It took a while, but uhh we got a waiver umm but we took like four umm
lung tests, tested our breathing, medicine and all this stuff and we
were finally in the clear and they gave us waivers and we went to MEPs
in December and we shipped out to bootcamp in February.

Okay umm.

 And did you guys start in the same class?

We did. We btoh finished Hellweek together umm he got injured after
Hellweek so he got rolled and he got hurt again so he got rolled a
month ago and got rolled again yeah.

 Tell me a little about your personality and why you think that
contributed to you getting through BUD/S.

Umm definitely really umm persistent I’d say. Umm in high school umm I
got like a 4.23 GPA being like a high umm doing like tough stuff if
that makes sense uhh. Like uhh I’m also really timid uhh I like really
quiet, uhh I like I love the saying “being a quiet professional” like
uhh not talking to anyone umm like knowing what I’m doing and doing
something really meaningful and big.

Yeah.

 So umm obviously you said your Dad was a SEAL, btu anyone else in
your family or was that your main motivator for wanting to become a
SEAL?

Umm say it again.

 So you said your Dad was a SEAL, anyone else in your family
that’s a SEAL or special operations or Special Forces or

Umm my Grandad was Army Special Forces, he’s a Green Beret. Uhh that
definitely uhh having that and my Dad and my Dad’s friends I treat
them like uncles I’ve known them for so long like a lot of military
umm like every male figure in my family was military soo I something
really wanted to do.

 Was umm any other option that you considered in the military
besides SEAL or was this all you wanted to..

Umm I was really like big in the water umm when I was like two my Dad
had uhh taught us how to swim. Uhh when we were like eight my brother
had already made the club swim team. SO we were really big in swimming
and water so umm. Of course my grand- my grandpa was in the Army so like
I never really considered that umm I kinda umm wanted to do like the
hardest thing, the best thing, the most challenging thing umm. You have
like the Green Berets and like the PJs and all the other ones I really
wanted umm the toughest one, the hardest one and the most rewarding one
umm revolving around teamwork being a good teammate and being a good man
overall.

 Umm a little bit more about your childhood, how were you
disciplined as a child?

Umm my parents were really strict but umm strict in a loving way like
umm I knew it was just disciplining umm they did it out of love umm I
kinda got that vibe from them umm.

 Were you spanked or were you?

I was I was. All that stuff, my parents, I remember what they told me
like no Cs no even Bs only As like even in preschool like strive for the
highest umm like a bi, big portion of who I am today I thank them for
it. It definitely umm really helped me strive for big goals ya know.

 So what about, you lived in San Diego, you didn't move at all?

No I never moved.

 WHat about your teenage years, did you participate in sports?

I did.

 WHat sports did you do?

In high school, I did wrestling and cross country.

 Umm which was there one you liked over the other?

Uhh I definitely liked cross country more, but cross country I
definitely enjoyed like umm I was overweight as a kid until freshman
year I did wrestling and I kinda lost a lot of weight and kinda got
fitter over my high school years. Uhh I just uhh I loved uhh I feel in
love with competition and just being challenged with uhh like cross
country like umm when you're racing and you’re next to the other guy and
you’re just racing and at the end your toe to toe I just kinda love that
feeling of where you just sprint ahead of him and having more heart and
even in wrestling like uhh the nervousness of going against someone
before a match uhh I just really fell in love with being competitive and
winning and uhh basically it.

 Tell me uhh tell me about the last five years leading up to BUD/S,
high school and what was in between high school.

Umm I graduated in 2018 and about a month before a month or two before I
graduated I went to the Navy recruitment office and got the paperwork
going and uhh the whole thing about the medical after a while it worked
out, just working out really hard, uhh got a job uhh and it was a really
big deal uhh deal for my family. We didn’t have anything to do and we
didn't want to go to college it was really the only thing we wanted to
do and we finally got in. 6 months about from when I got in to when I
graduated.

Yeah .

About right after high school.

 And then you went to bootcamp and then straight here. Do you
consider yourself impulsive at all?

Uhh not really. I like to know what I uhh what I get into a lot of
times.

 uhh any tattoos, speeding tickets?

No, no.

 What do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?

Excuse me?

 What do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?

Umm you mean like a certain thing or like?

Whether it was a certain day or something more extended?

For me it was definitely the grind like umm going from like a high
school setting where yeah I have to wake up early and study for a
certain essay or test and coming here umm getting your butt kicked
everyday and umm and then if someone would ask me the hardest thing for
me It’d be like Hellweek.

Yeah.

Hellweek was definitely really tough umm its like for me like normal
days during first phase you wake up umm and like at the end of the day
you get to be like yeah I get to take a warm shower and eat a lot of
food and then Hellweek is just like I’m staying here until like I finish
umm like Tuesday night you’re like umm you’re shivering umm like I can’t
feel my feet anymore umm I’m chaffing umm I’m so tired I can’t really
stand up and you’re just like oh my god I just gotta keep going like
umm.

 What motivated you to keep pushing through it?

Umm definitely like umm having just like grit like definitely frew up
playing sports that need a lot of grit like wrestling umm requires a lot
of heart. And my family umm my dad my mom umm i feel like umm growing up
in this kinda environment umm I couldn’t come home if I wouldn’t umm
succeed. Umm I felt like uhh I couldn’t see my famly again if I failed
umm.

 Did you feel like the group like here supported one another and you
through?

Like uhh the guys uhh I definitely couldn’t have made it through without
em like certain people here especially from coming from and being young
during this experience and some of these guys umm are 10, 12 years older
than me and having so much more experience they defi italy helped me
out. I couldn’t umm have done uhh be where I’m at without.

 Umm any physical, spiritual or mental practices that you utilize to
get through BUD/S?

Umm I’m catholic uhh I prayed a lot umm uhh there were moments during
Hellweek and even in the Island where I where I thought there was no way
I imma fail something like a testgate or Hellweek I, I look up to God
and prayed to Him, He uhh definitely feel like it helped me through a
lot of hard times even like getting getting to Bootcamp or getting
through that rough patch after high school to get here umm I definitely
do have a lot of faith. That definitely helped me out.

 What about was there ever a time where you had to make a difficult
decision or like observe somebody or have to make like an ethical or
moral decision here uhh at BUD/S or see someone kinda cheat the system a
little bit and you had to make a decision to address it or that
situation you’re in.

Umm not really that I can recall, but umm like cheating like uhh I can’t
really think of anything maybe like uhh I can’t really think of anything
like morally a situation here.

 Was somebody trying to cut corners or something like that?

Emm not that I can remember uhh maybe in like Helweek some guys put
padding like on their head like their hat so they don’t lose as much
hair uhh I didn’t, uhh I didn't think much of it.

Yeah.

I just uhh I just always kinda thought like do the right thing uhh help
everybody out, be for the guys.

 Umm why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?

Umm just the I’ll just never quit uhh there’s moments like uhh how uh
how am I gonna keep doing this, but you just do em. Like uhh you
definitely like in the beginning I was definitely like scared but
everything was so big and there was so much I had to go through but I
kinda just put my head down and said “bring it on”. You know like what
else more can you do to me.

 Why was quitting such a none option for you?

Umm one was just my family like umm even if I was tired of it umm just
that legacy of my family like uhh umm I think my Dad told me me and my
brother I think Sunday or Saturday night, Saturday night or Sunday
morning that he was going to be on the berm Friday when we secure
whether or not, if we’re there or not. I just umm that was a really big
motivator umm when I was in that dark void kinda spot like umm do it for
the love of my family like my mom and my dad and not just for them but
for myself like being, not having like you can’t put a price on being
able to live with yourself I think that was a big part.

 What do you think the difference is between uhh those that are
successful with this and not medically or physical, but with those that
quit?

Uhh just the refusal to give up and just like uhh not being afraid to
tackle what's behind the door that you’re about to face. Like not being
afraid of any challenges or obstacles or pain that uhh like just not
being afraid of what's behind the door that you’re about to open.

 Umm hows this experience changed you as a person if at all?

I definitely think I’ve matured like a lot in the past 7 or 8 months uhh
I came here I definitely uhh was a procrastinator in high school umm I
didn’t really have as much umm I still have some problems with it but I
definitely didn’t have as much situational awareness umm as when I came
here now I think I just uhh trying to be like uhh wanting to be squared
away and being a good person and being a good student and uh one day
hopefully be a good operator in the Teams.

 Uhh anything else you think I should’ve asked you, but I didn’t ask
you?

I think that’s good.

Haha great that’s everything.

Thank you,

Thank you, congratulations.

Okay, so this is participant 70. So I’ve got a series of questions
about 8 of them I guess, broken down in parts. We’ve got about 15
minutes to get through them.

Sounds good

Um, so when did you start your BUD/s class?

Uh, I was in class 338 originally in prep. First phase, got rolled
after hell week with ‘38 joined ‘39 and still here with ‘39.

Is this your first BUD/s experience?

Yes

I mean you got rolled, but then you…

Yeah, this is my first shot at it.



 (SIO): HOW MANY SIBLINGS DO YOU HAVE?

UH, I’VE GOT THREE OTHER SIBLINGS. I’M THE OLDEST OF 4 KIDS.

SO MARRIED?

YEAH, THEY’RE MARRIED.

SO YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH YOUR PARENTS?

VERY GOOD

 WHAT LIFE CHANGING EVENTS HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE PRIOR TO BUD/S?

PRIOR TO BUD/S? UHM, I DON’T KNOW IF THERE IS JUST ONE LIFE CHANGING
EVENT. I WOULD SAY HONESTLY, JUST, I WAS AN OVER ACHIEVER GROWING UP,
BUT WITH THAT CAME A LOT OF FAILURE AS WELL, SO JUST KIND OF DEALING
WITH FAILURE AND JUST YOU KNOW GETTING BACK ON THE HORSE AND YOU KNOW
CONTINUING ON AND CHASING WHATEVER DREAM I WAS CHASING THAT TIME IN MY
LIFE. JUST DOING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. UHM, I WOULD SAY
THAT PROBABLY WAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON ME. JUST GOING THROUGH THAT SAME
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

 HOW DID THAT, HOW DID THAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE OF BEING AN OVER
    ACHIEVER AND EXPERIENCING A LOT OF FAILURE AND GETTING RIGHT BACK
    ON THAT HORSE AND RIDING IT CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR EXPERIENCE AT
    BUD/S?

UH, I MEAN I USED PRETTY APPLICATIONS UH YOU KNOW IMAGINE UH, YOU KNOW,
YOU FAIL, YOU FAIL A LOT HERE AT BUD/S. OBVIOUSLY, UHM YOU JUST GOTT
KEEP DUSTING YOURSELF OFF EVERYDAY AND WAKE UP AND GET AFTER IT THE NEXT
DAY. YOU CAN’T REALLY DWELL ON, UHM, FAILING ANYTHING YOU KNOW. I DIDN’T
REALLY, LIKE, I DIDN’T REALLY, IT’S NOT LIKE I FAILED A BUNCH A BUNCH BY
ANY MEANS, BUT JUST LIKE YOU KNOW YOU’RE NEVER RIGHT KIND OF THING, YOU
KNOW ALWAYS GETTING BEAT FOR WHETHER YOU DESERVE IT OR NOT DESERVE IT’S
JUST PUTTING UP WITH THAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT KIND OF, YOU KNOW.

 HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PERSONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
    PROGRESSION THROUGH BUD/S?

UHM, I JUST, I DON’T KNOW. I’VE BEEN COMPETITIVE REALLY MY WHOLE LIFE ,
SO I WOULD SAY THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST APPLICABLE FACTOR OF MY
PERSONALITY. UHM, I, I DON’T KNOW, I’M JUST. I DON’T KNOW HOW ELSE TO
ANSWER THAT, I GUESS. I JUST WOULD SAY JUST A PART OF ME UH MADE IT EASY
TO JUST KEEP GETTING AFTER IT EVERYDAY.

 DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND THAT LED YOU TO PURSUE BECOMING PART
    OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY. IN PARTICULAR, WHAT, WHAT THE QUESTION IS

UHM, YOU KNOW THOUGHT THEY WERE THE BEST AND WANTED TO, UHM I WANTED TO
PURSUE, I WANTED TO PURSUE SOMETHING GREAT LIKE THAT, SO UHM, I’VE LIKE
ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT TOO, SO IT PROBABLY STARTED WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
MIDDLE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND UHM, I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED
BY KIND OF THE HIGHER THAT IT IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY, NOT EVERYBODY MAKES
IT THROUGH YOU KNOW, ONLY THE STRONGEST GUYS GET TO THE END SORT OF
THING, AND THAT WAS APPEALING TO ME BACK THEN, AND UHM, I GUESS THAT’S
WHY. DID I ANSWER THE QUESTION AT ALL?

YEAH.

OF IT?

PART OF THE SEAL COMMUNITY, AND IN PARTICULAR, WHAT, WHAT THE QUESTION
IS ASKING ABOUT IS DO YOU HAVE ANY SEALS FAMILY OR FRIENDS, OR ANY
MILITARY FAMILY OR FRIENDS?

CHECK, CHECK, GOTCHA. SO YEAH, NO FAMILY, NO FRIENDS THAT WERE IN THE
TEAMS. UHM YEAH, BUT I JUST GREW UP PLAYING SPORTS, UHM MY ENTIRE LIFE.
I THINK THAT’S, JUST PROBABLY THAT COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WAS ALWAYS TO
BE A PART OF A TEAM. UHM, I’LL SAY THAT WAS ANOTHER DRAW FOR ME, BECAUSE
THAT WAS LIKE MY LIFE GROWING UP THAT’S REALLY ALL I DID, SO ALL I
REALLY CARED ABOUT WAS, UHM YOU KNOW, WHATEVER SPORTS SEASON I WAS IN
KIND OF A DEAL, SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW HAVING THAT, BEING IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD GROWING UP AND THEN INTO HIGHSCHOOL AND
COLLEGE I WOULD SAY THAT IS PROBABLY WHY, YOU KNOW THAT THE TEAMS ARE
VERY APPEALING TO ME.

SO LET ME ASK YOU A SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. HOW WERE
YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? SPANKS, TIMEOUTS, GROUNDING?

 SO LET ME ASK YOU A SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.
    HOW WERE YOU DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD? SPANKS, TIMEOUTS, GROUNDING?

ALL OF IT, ALL.

ALL, EVERYTHING?

YEAH, A GOOD MIX OF ALL OF THAT. UHM, YEAH, I WAS, UH, I NEVER GOT IN
TOO MUCH TROUBLE THANKFULLY, GROWING UP, BUT WHEN I WAS LIKE REAL YOUNG,
TALKING LIKE, YOU KNOW, KINDERGARTEN AND STUFF LIKE THAT, UHM, I JUST
REMEMBER MY MOM TELLING ME THAT I DID HAVE LIKE A SPECIAL BEHAVIOR CHART
GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, CAUSE I WAS JUST ALWAYS ACTING UP, DOING STUFF, SO
UHM, BUT YEAH, MY PARENTS DID A GOOD JOB OF DISCIPLINING ME AND I JUST
KIND OF SNAPPED OUT OF THAT. UHM, I WAS A PRETTY GOOD STUDENT THROUGHOUT
SCHOOL.

 DID YOU, DID YOU MOVE AROUND AS A CHILD?

UH, NOT TOO MUCH. UHM, SO WENT TO PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN IN THE
PLACE WHERE ARE GRADUATED THEN I WENT TWO YEARS AND DID 1ST GRADE AND
2ND GRADE IN ANOTHER TOWN, THEN CAME BACK TO THAT TOWN I GRADUATED FROM,
SO. SO, NOT TOO MUCH MOVING AROUND.

SO, YOU SAID YOU PARTICIPATED IN TEAM SPORTS IN HIGHSCHOOL. WHAT SPORTS?

UHM, FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL, BASEBALL, AND I DID TRACK FOR TWO YEARS. DID
ALL THE OTHERS FOR 4 YEARS.

 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE LAST 5 YEARS PRIOR TO COMING TO
    BUD/S?

UH, I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PLAYED, UHM, I PLAYED BASEBALL AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF SIOUX FALLS SOUTH DAKOTA. UHM, I DID 5 YEARS OF COLLEGE, SO THAT WAS
PRETTY MUCH IT. I GRADUATED COLLEGE. I TOOK LIKE ANOTHER...I GOT LASIK
AT THE END OF COLLEGE SO I HAD TO WAIT LIKE ANOTHER 6 MONTHS TO JOIN
BECAUSE THERE’S LIKE UH YOU HAVE TO DO THAT POST GETTING SURGERY YOU
HAVE TO WAIT LIKE 6 MONTHS BEFORE YOU CAN JOIN SO WAITED THAT 6 MONTHS
THEN JOINED AS SOON AS THAT 6 MONTHS WAS UP.

ARE YOU AN OFFICER?

ENLISTED.

ENLISTED?

YEAH.

WITH YOUR COLLEGE DEGREE?

YEAH. YOU’D BE SURPRISED, THE MAJORITY OF THE E-DAWGS HERE HAVE COLLEGE
DEGREES.

(UNINTELLIGIBLE)...WHAT IS YOUR DEGREE IN?’

UH, EXERCISE SCIENCE WITH A MINOR IN PSYCHOLOGY.

WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE?

IMPULSIVE AS FAR AS LIKE…?

IT SAYS IN A, AS A PERSONALITY.

UHM, I DON’T KNOW...I DON’T KNOW ABOUT IMPULSIVE. UHM, MAYBE I THINK
LIKE POLARIZING, A LITTLE BIT, I ALWAYS WAS, BUT I DON’T THINK
IMPULSIVE. I WOULDN’T SAY THAT.

SO AN EXAMPLE THAT THEY GIVE IS, UH DO YOU HAVE ANY TATTOOS?

NO TATTOOS, NO.

APPARENTLY THAT’S A SIGN OF IMPULSIVITY.

YEAH, NO TATTOOS, YEAH.

 WHAT WAS YOUR MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S?

UHM, PROBABLY GETTING ROLLED. I WAS ROLLED IF I DIDN’T TELL YOU THAT.

WHAT DID YOU GET ROLLED FOR?

I GOT ROLLED FOR DROWN PROOFING.

FOR WHAT?

FOR DROWN PROOFING. SO, YOU KNOW TYING YOUR FEET UP, TYING YOUR HANDS UP
AND…

OH, WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH THROUGH?

UHM, IT WAS JUST LIKE JUST NOT NOT QUITTING, NOT ACCEPTING FAILURE AS AN
OPTION YOU KNOW. LIKE I SAID I’VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD MANY A TIME AND I
KNEW THAT JUST YOU KNOW IT’S JUST A DROWN PROOFING TEST, WHICH IS A
STUPID TEST. YOU KNOW, UHM I WAS NOT GOING TO LET THAT STOP ME FROM
ACHIEVING MY GOAL. I HAD ALREADY MADE IT THROUGH HELL WEEK AT THAT POINT
YOU KNOW, SO IT WAS JUST, YEAH.

SO WHEN YOU GET ROLLED, DO YOU GO BACK TO THE START? AND DO IT AGAIN OR
WHERE YOU LEFT OFF?

NO, SO I I PICKED UP WHERE I LEFT OFF SINCE I WAS A POST HELL WEEK ROLL
BACK. UHM, IF YOU DON’T MAKE IT TO HELL WEEK AND GET ROLLED BACK FOR
SOMETHING MEDICAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO START AT THE
BEGINNING AND MAKE IT THROUGH HELL WEEK. AFTER HELL WEEK IF YOU GET
ROLLED FOR SOMETHING YOU’RE STILL IN FIRST PHASE, BUT YOU JUST PICK UP
WHEREVER YOU LEFT OFF.

WITH THE NEXT CLASS?

WITH THE NEXT CLASS, YEAH.

DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE SUPPORTED BY THE GROUP?

BY THE OTHER STUDENTS? OH, YEAH 100 PERCENT. 100 PERCENT, YEAH. YEAH, I
WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE QUITE A FEW GUYS, QUITE A FEW POST HELL WEEK GUYS
GOT ROLLED BACK TOGETHER FOR ‘38 AS YOU CAN SEE A MAJORITY OF THE CLASS
IS ‘38 ORIGINAL GUYS. UHM, AND THAT, THOSE GUYS WERE AWESOME. YOU KNOW
LIKE, A MAJORITY OF US WERE TOP UHM, TOP PERFORMERS FROM ‘38 THAT GOT
ROLLED BACK FOR WATER EVOLUTIONS AND WE KIND OF BANDED TOGETHER AND WERE
NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW, NOT GOING TO TAKE YOU KNOW FAILURE AS A FINAL
OUTCOME KIND OF THING, AND UHM, WE ALL JUST GOT AFTER IT AS BEING
ROLLBACKS, UHM IMPROVED OUR WEAKNESSES AND CAME BACK A MUCH STRONGER
CANDIDATE AFTER BEING ROLLED BACK.

 SO, WHAT PRACTICES PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL, ETC. DID YOU
    UTILIZE TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

UH, PRACTICES AS FAR AS WHAT SPECIFICALLY?

LIKE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL.

UH,

DID YOU MEDITATE? WHAT DID YOU DO?

I DIDN’T REALLY MEDITATE OR MUCH OF THAT. UH, I GUESS I WAS JUST TOO
STUBBORN TO QUIT. I JUST, I KNEW GOING INTO IT THAT I WASN’T GOING TO
QUIT TO BE THE REASON YOU KNOW THAT I DIDN’T MAKE IT THROUGH THAT WASN’T
GOING TO BE THE REASON FOR NOT MAKING IT THROUGH. UH, I WOULDN’T SAY I
DID ANY SORT OF MEDITATION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. UHM, YEAH. JUST
STUBBORNNESS I GUESS THAT’S THE WAY TO PUT IT.

 WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING, WHAT WENT
    THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION? SO, WHAT DECISION DID
    YOU REALLY STRUGGLE WITH? FOR EXAMPLE, RUNNING CLASSMATES OUT OR
    TURNING IN SOMEONE FOR CHEATING.

UHM

WERE THERE ANY INSTANCES OF THAT FOR YOU?

UH, NO NOTHING NOTHING GLARING. YEAH, I MEAN HELL WEEK WAS, HELL WEEK
WAS A WHILE AGO NOW. UH YEAH I, I DON’T KNOW. I GUESS THERE IS NOTHING
AS SOLID FOR ME HAVING TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I JUST YOU KNOW, I WENT
INTO, I WENT INTO HELL WEEK WITH WITH THE ATTITUDE OF YOU KNOW GIVE IT
THE BEST, BEST I GOT, I’M NOT GOING TO QUIT. AND IF THE BEST I GOT ISN’T
ENOUGH, SO BE IT. UHM I CAN GO OUT OF MY WAY TO RUN CERTAIN GUYS OUT OF
THE CLASS AND YOU KNOW IF THEY DIDN’T KEEP UP, THEY COULDN’T KEEP UP AND
THAT WAS THAT, YOU KNOW. BUT YEA.

 SO, SO YOU SORT OF ANSWERED THIS QUESTION, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU
    WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

JUST COMPETITIVENESS, AND JUST TOO STUBBORN TO QUIT. I JUST YOU KNOW
FAILING AS QUITTING WAS JUST NOT AN OPTION FOR ME, AND

i.   DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE THAT DID NOT MAKE
    IT?

ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM US THAT DID MAKE IT YOU MEAN?

YEAH.

UHM

LIKE DIFFERENT FROM YOU. YOUR CHARACTERISTICS.

I WOULD SAY I MEAN, CHARACTER I MEAN OBVIOUS ANSWER IT’S NOT REALLY
CHARACTER IT’S PREPARATION YOU KNOW, I CAN REALLY SEE THAT GUYS FROM MY
PERSPECTIVE CLEARLY DID NOT UHM PREPARE THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE FOR THE
PROGROM. UHM, I DON’T KNOW WHY THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DO THAT, BUT UHM
CHARACTER WISE, I DON’T KNOW YOU CAN JUST SEE IN SOME PEOPLE JUST DON’T
SEE IT IN OTHER PEOPLE AND I THINK A LOT OF THE GUYS THAT DO QUIT, I WAS
NOT SURPRISED. UH, YOU KNOW THERE OBVIOUSLY ARE GUYS THAT YOU ARE
SURPRISED THAT QUIT. I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S RUNNING THROUGH THEIR MIND. UH,
YEAH, I DON’T KNOW IF I COULD PUT IT ON ONE CHARACTER TRAIT IT JUST KIND
OF, I DON’T KNOW. WE, WE, UH, WE DID LIKE TWO MONTHS OF PREP. WE REALLY
DO LIKE TWO MONTHS OF BOOT CAMP AND THEN IT’S TWO MONTHS OF PREP THEN
ANOTHER MONTH OF PTRR BEFORE FIRST PHASE, SO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH MOST GUYS BEFORE FIRST PHASE EVEN STARTS, SO KIND OF FROM SPENDING
THAT TIME WITH THOSE GUYS YOU CAN KIND OF SEE UH MAYBE WHO’S NOT, THOSE,
THOSE GUYS WHO ARE NOT MAYBE AS MENTALLY SQUARED AWAY AS OTHERS SORT OF
THING, SO I DON’T KNOW IF I CAN PUT IT ON JUST ONE TRAIT.

 BONUS QUESTION - HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A
    PERSON?

Uhm, that’s a good question. Uhm, I don’t know if it has changed me,
uhm, as a person to much. Uhm I...that might, that might yup.

Alright.

That make take some. That might take a little more reflection for me
to answer that completely.

Alright well we’re about out of time anyway.

Alright yeah sorry about that.

No problem

OK, IS IT OK IF I RECORD THE INTERVIEW?

YES.

AND WHAT’S YOUR PARTICIPANT ID?

ID 71.

71, OK GREAT. WHAT WAS YOUR ORIGINAL BUDS CLASS?

IT WAS 338.

AND WHEN DID YOU GET ROLLED INTO 339?

I GOT ROLLED AFTER HELL WEEK FOR THE CSO TREAD UMM ALONG WITH I THINK
WE HAD 8 OTHER GUYS WHO GOT ROLLED FOR THAT AS WELL.

OK SO THAT’S STILL FIRST PHASE.

YEAH POST HELL WEEK FIRST PHASE I THINK IT WAS TWO WEEKS GOT OVER
WITH.

AND SO WHEN YOU JOINED 339 YOU GOT TO JOIN THOUGH BACK AT THAT SAME
POINT?

YEP SO WE WAIT UNTIL THEY GOT TO THAT POINT AND THEN REJOINED THE
CLASS.

AND WE’LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THAT SOME MORE. SO TELL ME ABOUT
HOW MANY SIBLINGS YOU HAVE?

I’VE GOT TWO SIBLINGS, TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS, THEY’RE TWINS, THEIR
NAMES ARE BROCK AND BRADY. UMM THEY’RE 14 YEARS OLD, 8TH GRADERS, UMM
YEAH THEY’RE AWESOME UHH LOOKED UP TO ME A LOT GROWING UP.

HOW MUCH OLDER ARE YOU?

I’M 23 SO I’M 9 YEARS OLDER THAN THEY ARE. UMM BUT YEAH WE GET ALONG
REALLY REALLY WELL BUT LIKE I SAID THEY’VE ALWAYS KINDA LOOKED UP TO
ME SO I’VE TRIED TO BE A GOOD MENTOR TO THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
BUT THEY’RE HUGE INTO SPORTS JUST LIKE I WAS WHEN I WAS A KID SO WE
WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING SPORTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

HOW ABOUT PARENTS? ALL THE SAME PARENTS OR ARE YOUR PARENTS MARRIED?

YEP I’VE GOT GREAT PARENTS, HAD A REALLY GOOD CHILDHOOD THEY’VE ALWAYS
BEEN TOGETHER, BEEN TOGETHER FOR ABOUT 35 YEARS NOW. SO YEP I’VE GOT
GREAT PARENTS MY DAD IS 58 YEARS OLD AND MY MOM IS 53 I THINK.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM, IS IT CLOSE?

CLOSE, REALLY CLOSE. MY WHOLE FAMILY IS REALLY CLOSE, ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY. UMM YEAH SO
I WAS REALLY LUCKY GROWING UP, MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS SUPER
SUPPORTIVE,WITH LIKE EVERYTHING I DID, IT DIDN’T REALLY MATTER UMM
LIKE I SAID I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTO SPORTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IF
ALL OF THE SUDDEN I WOULD SAY I DIDN’T WANT TO PLAY A SPORT THEY WOULD
BE FINE WITH IT, THEY WOULD NEVER FORCE ME TO DO ANYTHING. UMM AND
SAME WITH COMING TO THE MILITARY, WANTING TO COME TO BUD/S, THEY WERE
VERY SUPPORTIVE RIGHT AWAY SO THEY’VE ALWAYS BEEN EASY TO DEAL WITH IN
THAT ASPECT, I’VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE I HAD A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION FROM
THEM, SO.

DID YOU NOW, GO TO HIGH SCHOOL, SO WHAT WAS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL?

YEAH, SO I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND GRADUATED, PLAYED SPORTS IN HIGH
SCHOOL AND THEN I DECIDED NOT TO PLAY SPORTS IN COLLEGE BECAUSE, I
WANTED TO PLAY BASEBALL IN COLLEGE AND THEN DECIDED LAST SECOND THAT I
WASN’T GOING TO, SO I JUST WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA,
GRADUATED FROM THERE, UHH I STUDIED BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND IT TOOK
ME, I HAD TO DO ONE EXTRA SEMESTER SO I GRADUATED DECEMBER 2018 AND
THEN SHIPPED OUT TO BOOT CAMP IN FEBRUARY.

I’LL ASK YOU SOME MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE. ANYTHING LIFE
CHANGING EVENTS THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO YOU COMING TO BUD/S?

LIFE CHANGING EVENTS? FOR ME THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE CRAZY, NOTHING
CRAZY I WAS JUST WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I WAS DOING FINE UMM BUT I WAS
JUST KINDA BORED WITH WHAT I WAS DOING, YOU KNOW? IT JUST WASN’T
REALLY FOR ME, OBVIOUSLY I HAD FINISHED MY DEGREE, YOU KNOW MY PARENTS
HAD SAVED ALL THAT MONEY SO I DIDN’T WANT TO WASTE ALL THAT AND NOT
GET MY DEGREE BUT EVER SINCE I STOPPED PLAYING SPORTS I JUST DIDN’T
HAVE ANYTHING TO KIND OF GO AFTER AND CHASE, NOTHING THAT EXCITED ME.
SCHOOLWISE I JUST DIDN’T SEE MYSELF GETTING A NORMAL JOB AFTER COLLEGE
UMM I’VE ALWAYS LIKED THINGS THAT ARE CHALLENGING AND ADVENTUROUS SO
THAT’S KINDA WHY I CAME HERE BUT AS FAR AS LIFE CHANGING EVENTS THERE
WASN’T ANY SINGLE EVENT THAT WAS BIG FOR ME.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR
PERSONALITY AND HOW THAT PLAYED INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE?

UMM, PERSONALITY I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A PRETTY OUTGOING GUY, ALWAYS HAD A
LOT OF FRIENDS GROWING UP, LIKE I SAID I LOVED TO PLAY SPORTS, PRETTY
ADVENTUROUS, LIKE STUDIED ABROAD IN COLLEGE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC SO
YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY I’M A VERY CURIOUS GUY, I LIKE TO LEARN NEW
THINGS, VERY GOAL DRIVEN, GOAL ORIENTED, I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO
GO AFTER. UMM PRETTY MOTIVATED PERSON, UMM WHAT ELSE, YEAH I MEAN MY
FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, WHAT ELSE, YEAH THAT’S
ABOUT IT.

WHAT ABOUT, I DON’T KNOW IF I ASKED YOU THIS, YOU WENT TO UNIVERSITY
OF NEBRASKA BUT WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?

I GREW UP IN NEBRASKA, I LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN, NEMAHA NEBRASKA UNTIL
I WAS 7 AND THEN MY MOM GOT A JOB UP IN LINCOLN SO WE MOVED UP TO THE
CAPITAL CITY, LIVED THERE EVER SINCE, SO PRETTY MUCH GREW UP IN THE
CITY BUT A LOT OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE FROM THE COUNTRY. MY
GRANDPARENTS ARE FARMERS SO I GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE RURAL
LIFE AND ALL THAT STUFF.

DID YOU HELP ON THE FARM?

YEAH, YEP I WOULD GO DOWN THERE AND HELP THEM, HELP HIM, HELPED MY
GRANDPA A LOT.

WHAT ABOUT WHAT LED YOU TO WANT TO BECOME A PART OF THE SEAL
COMMUNITY?

UMM JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE BEST OF THE BEST, YOU KNOW?
JUST KINDA THE STEREOTYPICAL THINGS THAT YOU HEAR READING ALL THE
BOOKS AND WATCHING ALL THE MOVIES. THE VIDEOS JUST LOOKED AWESOME TO
ME, SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE THE BEST OF THE BEST. SO YOU KNOW, SOME OF
THESE GUYS IN HERE THOUGHT ABOUT BEING A GREEN BERET OR A PJ, ALL
THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT FOR ME YOU KNOW THIS WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT I WANTED TO DO UMM I DON’T KNOW IT DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE WATER. I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS JOIN BECAUSE THEY LIKE WATER. UMM
FOR ME IT JUST LOOKED LIKE THE HARDEST THING TO DO SO THAT’S WHAT I
WANTED TO DO.

NOW, ANYBODY THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS A SEAL?

NO I DIDN’T KNOW ANYONE PREVIOUSLY, I HAD MET A FEW GUYS WHO LIKE UH
THEY HAVE MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I HAD A FEW
FRIENDS THAT JOINED SEALS SO I WAS ABLE TO TRAIN WITH THEM BEFORE I
CAME BUT NO I DIDN’T HAVE ANY FAMILY MEMBERS OR ANYBODY CLOSE THAT I
KNEW THAT WAS A THAT WAS A SEAL PREVIOUSLY.

ANY MILITARY IN YOUR FAMILY?

UHH MY DAD’S DAD WAS INFANTRY IN THE ARMY, HE FOUGHT IN THE KOREAN
WAR. THAT WAS IT. MY OTHER GRANDPA DIDN’T END UP GETTING DRAFTED
BECAUSE HE WAS A FARMER UM AND THEN I THINK SOME OF MY GRANDPA’S
BROTHERS WERE IN THE ARMY BUT THAT DIDN’T REALLY PLAY INTO MY DECISION
TO JOIN THE MILITARY.

SO IT WASN’T A BIG PART OF YOUR LIFE? AT WHAT POINT DID YOU IDENTIFY
THAT YOU WANTED TO GO INTO THE MILITARY AND THEN INTO THE SEALS?

UM I WOULD SAY COLLEGE I WAS KINDA MY JUNIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE I STARTED
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO. I’VE ALWAYS KINDA HAD THIS
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD I HAD A COUPLE BUDDIES THAT WANTED TO COME HERE
AS WELL SO WE WERE KINDA TRAINING FOR IT TOGETHER AND THEN I WOULD SAY
BETWEEN MY JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE I KINDA SAID YOU KNOW
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. I TOLD MY PARENTS AND EVERYTHING, REALLY
GOT SERIOUS ABOUT TRAINING UM AND THEN LIKE I SAID AS FAR AS COMING TO
BUD/S THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I WAS REALLY LOOKING AT. I DIDN’T
REALLY LOOK AT THE MARINE CORPS OR ARMY OR ANY OF THAT STUFF UM I HAD
SOME OUTSIDE INFLUENCES FROM A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS THAT WERE THINKING
ABOUT IT AS WELL. I HAD ONE BUDDY, A TRAINING PARTNER THAT CAME HERE
WITH CLASS 337 AND WE KINDA TRAINED THROUGHOUT COLLEGE TOGETHER.

NOW DID HE GO THROUGH AND COMPLETE BUD/S?

NO, HE QUIT BO SO THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY PRETTY FRUSTRATING FOR ME. UM HE
WAS ABLE TO COME A CLASS BEFORE ME BECAUSE HE GRADUATED BEFORE ME SO
YEAH THAT WAS A HUGE BUMMER FOR ME. YEAH HE QUIT WHEN I WAS IN BO … SO
I MEAN IT WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT AT THAT POINT I HAD MADE SO MANY GOOD
FRIENDS IN CLASS 338 IT WAS LIKE WHATEVER, I GOT OVER IT.

STAYED FOCUSED?

YEAH.

WHAT ABOUT, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD. HOW WERE YOU
DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD?

UM YEAH I MEAN MY PARENTS WEREN’T LIKE SUPER STRICT THEY ALSO THEY
WOULDN’T JUST LET ME GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING. UM I COULD USUALLY
ALWAYS GET AWAY WITH THINGS WITH MY DAD MORE THAN MY MOM FOR SURE. UM
BUT YEAH THEY WEREN’T SUPER STRICT ITS NOT LIKE I WAS GETTING GROUNDED
ALL THE TIME BUT THEY DEFINITELY KEPT ME ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW
LIKE SCHOOL WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM THAT’S ONE THING THEY DID NOT
TOLERATE AT ALL YOU KNOW WAS ME JACKING AROUND AT SCHOOL GETTING INTO
TROUBLE. UM I MEAN I WAS ALWAYS A PRETTY GOOD STUDENT AT SCHOOL. I
KNEW WHEN TO LOCK IT ON AND NOT MESS AROUND SO AS FAR LIKE PUNISHING
ME I USED TO GET SPANKED AS A LITTLE KID … GETTING GROUNDED, I WOULD
GET GROUNDED. I WAS PRETTY STUBBORN AS A KID SO LIKE I WOULD ALWAYS
TRY TO GET MYSELF OUT OF IT … I MEAN BUT YEAH THEY WEREN’T OVERLY
STRICT BUT ALSO THEY WOULDN’T JUST LET ME DO WHAT I WANTED.

AND THEN YOU SAID YOU ONLY MOVED ONCE IN YOUR CHILDHOOD YEARS AND NOT
TOO FAR?

YEP IT WAS ONLY LIKE AN HOUR AWAY.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS DID YOU PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS TALK TO ME
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.

YEP YEP I PLAYED FOOTBALL BASKETBALL BASEBALL IN HIGHSCHOOL, LOVED
SPORTS THAT’S LIKE ALL I DID, KEPT ME OUT OF TROUBLE. LIKE I SAID
BASEBALL THAT WAS MY BIG THING I WANTED TO PLAY IN COLLEGE. FOR ME
THOUGH IT WAS LIKE IF I COULDN’T PLAY DIVISION ONE I DIDN’T WANT TO
PLAY AND THAT’S BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED THAT’S WHY I DIDN’T CONTINUE
TO PLAY IN COLLEGE UM BUT YEAH SPORTS WAS MY LIFE.

AND WHY WERE SPORTS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

I GUESS ITS JUST LIKE THE RELATIONSHIP, ALL MY FRIENDS PLAYED SPORTS
AND UM THAT’S ALL WE WOULD DO. WHEN I WAS A KID WE WOULD ALWAYS PLAY
FOOTBALL OUT IN THE BACKYARD, BASEBALL UM … IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WE WOULD
TRAVEL ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY I WAS ON A TRAVEL TEAM PLAYING BASEBALL
SO THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH MY LIFE. UH AND I JUST LOVED IT I LOVED THE
TEAM ASPECT LIKE I SAID ALL MY BEST FRIENDS WERE GUYS I PLAYED SPORTS
WITH SO I WAS ALWAYS A HUGE FAN GROWING UP WE WOULD ALWAYS GO TO
NEBRASKA FOOTBALL GAMES EVERY SATURDAY. YEAH IT’S JUST ALWAYS
SOMETHING I’VE BEEN INTO MY WHOLE LIFE, I LOVE SPORTS.

WHAT ABOUT THE LAST 5 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE BEFORE COMING HERE, SO
COLLEGE, ANY JOBS IN BETWEEN?

YEAH I MEAN I HAD A LOT OF JOBS IN COLLEGE, A LOT OF MANUAL LABOR. I
USED TO ROOF HOUSES I WORKED ON A RANCH FOR A WHILE FOR LIKE A YEAR.
IN COLLEGE I WORKED AT COORS IN COLLEGE, GOT FREE BEER THAT WAS BIG UM
YEAH A LOT OF LIKE OUTDOORSY JOBS I’VE ALWAYS BEEN A PRETTY OUTDOORSY
GUY, NEVER REALLY WANTED TO JUST SIT AT A DESK SO I JUST WENT AFTER
THAT.

WHAT YEAR DID YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE?

I GRADUATED IN DECEMBER OF 2018.

AND THEN THAT WAS RIGHT BEFORE BOOTCAMP?

YEP.

SO NO YEAR LONG STINTS THAT WEREN’T TIED TO PART TIME JOBS?

NOPE, NOTHING .

DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE AT ALL?

IMPULSIVE? … SOMETIMES.

IN WHAT WAYS?

UM, … MAN … JUST WHEN THERE’S ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING FUN I’LL
GO AFTER IT AND SOMETIMES THAT DOESN’T BENEFIT ME YOU KNOW THERE’S
DEFINITELY TIMES I COULD STAY IN AND BE MORE PRODUCTIVE BUT IF PEOPLE
ARE GOING OUT I’LL GO OUT .. UM YEAH JUST LIKE IN COLLEGE ANY TRIPS
THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO TAKE I WAS ALWAYS IN FOR THAT. SO YEAH SOMETIMES
I’M DEFINITELY AN IMPULSIVE PERSON BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT WHERE ITS
SUPER NEGATIVE.

ANY TATTOOS?

NO TATTOOS.

MANY SPEEDING TICKETS?

NOPE I THINK I HAVE ONE SPEEDING TICKET, WHICH ACTUALLY KINDA
SURPRISED ME. I DON’T DRIVE LIKE A MANIAC BUT THERE’S DEFINITELY GUYS
LIKE THAT LIKE MY BUDDY (UNINTELLIGIBLE) DRIVING LIKE AN IDIOT. BUT
NO, NO TATTOOS NO SPEEDING TICKETS UM AS FAR AS LIKE RUN INS WITH THE
LAW … IN COLLEGE I GOT ONE MIP (MINOR IN POSSESSION) THAT WAS LIKE MY
SOPHOMORE YEAR I WASN’T LIKE CRAZY DRUNK OR ANYTHING I WAS JUST HAVING
A BEER AT THIS, IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS HAVING A BEER AT THIS PLACE AND
DIDN’T HAVE A WRISTBAND IT WAS STUPID. LIKE I SAID I WASN’T DRUNK AT
ALL, WASN’T A HUGE DEAL UM WENT THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS OR
WHATEVER. THE NAVY KNOWS THAT I HAVE THAT, THAT’S IT. THAT’S ALL THAT
I’VE HAD.

WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S WAS?

YEAH, I WOULDN’T SAY ANY SINGLE THING WAS TERRIBLE, FOR ME IT WOULD
JUST BE LIKE JUST THE GRIND, JUST WAKING UP ON A WEDNESDAY OR WHATEVER
KNOWING THAT YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND GIVE 100% AGAIN THAT
DAY AND YOU’RE SUPER SUPER TIRED UM I WOULD JUST SAY GETTING YOURSELF
OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING … ONCE YOU GET THE DAY GOING IT WASN’T
ACTUALLY THAT BAD … UM BUT THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS
ABOUT HELL WEEK. YOU DIDN’T DEAL WITH LIKE HAVING TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY
AND BEING AND LIKE BEING IN YOUR WARM COMFORTABLE BED YOU KNOW UM ...
YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT WAS THE HARDEST FOR ME.
GETTING ROLLED SUCKED TOO. UMM JUST HAVING TO WATCH ALL OF MY GOOD
BUDDIES GO ON WITH TRAINING AND I HAVE TO SIT BACK FOR SEVEN WEEKS FOR
ONE TREAD IS WHAT WE FAILED, WHAT WE GOT ROLLED FOR. THAT WAS PRETTY
TOUGH AT FIRST BUT IT ENDED UP BEING ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO HAPPEN
TO ME. IT WAS DEFINITELY A POSITIVE.

WHAT HELPED YOU GET THROUGH THAT?

UM WELL FIRST OF ALL I GOT LUCKY BECAUSE THE OTHER EIGHT GUYS WHO GOT
ROLLED WITH ME I AM PRETTY GOOD BUDDIES WITH SO BEING WITH THEM WAS
HUGE UM THE GUYS IN THIS CLASS ARE AWESOME I LOVE CLASS 339 UM … WHAT
ELSE … JUST HAVING THAT TIME TO KINDA GROW AND UM IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
HELL WEEK SO IT GAVE ME SOME TIME TO RELAX AND REJUVENATE MYSELF
METNALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND THEN YOU KNOW TAKE A STEP AND SEE WHAT I
CAN WORK ON AND GET BETTER UM YOU KNOW AND I FIGURED IF I HAVE SEVEN
WEEKS OFF I’M NOT GOING TO WASTE MY TIME I’M GOING TO TRY TO COME BACK
A BETTER BUD/S STUDENT. UM AND IN THE LONG RUN IT DEFINITELY, AFTER I
CAME BACK FROM THAT I HAD NO ISSUES, I HARDLY FAILED ANYTHING AT ALL
SO I DEFINITELY THINK IT WAS A POSITIVE THING.

ANY PRACTICES YOU UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO GO THROUGH BUD/S
WHETHER PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL?

NOTHING BIG REALLY YOU KNOW I TRIED TO TAKE CARE OF MY BODY DURING
FIRST PHASE I COULD HAVE STRETCHED MORE, I WOULD GO GET MASSAGES ON
THE WEEKEND SOMETIMES … UM AS FAR AS MENTALLY I JUST TRIED I JUST
TRIED TO GET AS MUCH SLEEP AS I COULD. ON THE WEEKENDS A LOT OF TIMES
UM A LOT OF TIMES THEY WOULD HAVE GUYS IN THE BARRACKS THAT YOU COULD
PAY THAT WOULD SHINE YOUR BOOTS. I WOULD ALWAYS PAY SOMEONE TO SHINE
MY BOOTS UM … YEAH I JUST TRIED TO TAKE CARE OF MY BODY GET AS MUCH
SLEEP AS YOU CAN. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD SEE GUYS THROUGHOUT THE PIPELINE
WHO WERE GETTING SICK WERE HARDLY EVER MAKING IT. THEY WOULD GET
ROLLED OR THEY WOULD QUIT BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS GETTING ROLLED. SO
THAT WAS A BIG THING FOR ME I JUST WANTED TO KEEP MY BODY HEALTHY FOR
AS LONG AS I COULD BECAUSE YOU WOULD SEE GUYS GET ROLLED AND THE
SECOND TIME THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THEY JUST DON’T HAVE IT IN THEM
ANYMORE.

WAS THERE A TIME YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION OR WATCHED
SOMEONE MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION?

IN BUD/S YOU’RE SAYING?

YEAH.

DIFFICULT DECISION … UM NOTHING IS REALLY POPPING INTO MY HEAD RIGHT
NOW, MY CLASS WAS PRETTY GOOD AT HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE SO WE
DIDN’T REALLY RUN INTO ANY BIG ISSUES FOR THAT UM YEAH YOU KNOW SINCE
I’M NOT AN OFFICER THAT WASN’T REALLY MY PLACE ALL THE TIME … UM FOR
ME IF THERE WAS ANYTHING BIG I WOULD OBVIOUSLY STEP UP AND SAY
SOMETHING BUT MOST OF THE TIME I WOULD JUST KINDA TRY TO MIND MY OWN
BUSINESS AND UH TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING MYSELF AND JUST WORRY ABOUT
MYSELF.

WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN BUD/S?

UM FOR ME IT WAS JUST LIKE I PRETTY MUCH GAVE UP MY WHOLE LIFE TO COME
HERE UM I’M NOT GOING TO SAY THERE WERE NEVER TIMES WHERE … I NEVER
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT QUITTING AT ALL I KNEW I WASN’T GOING TO QUIT FOR
SURE BUT JUST HAVING THAT IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD, HAVING BEEN THOUGH
BOOT CAMP, I GAVE UP MY WHOLE LIFE TO COME HERE I KNEW THAT THERE WAS
NO WAY I WAS GOING TO QUIT. I WOULDN’T SAY I WAS A … I WASN’T A GREAT
PERFORMER BY ANY MEANS IN BUD/S. I PASSED ALL MY STUFF YOU KNOW I WAS
FINE UM BUT ITS NOT LIKE I WAS LEADING THE 4 MILE RUNS OR THE SWIMS I
WAS MORE OF A MIDDLE OF THE PACK GUY. BUT FOR ME I THINK ONE OF MY
PERSONALITY STRENGTHS THAT HELPED ME GET THROUGH IS I WAS PRETTY
STUBBORN AND THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING TO LET THE INSTRUCTORS SEE
ME QUIT. I WOULDN’T LET THEM WIN. LIKE I SAID MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS
VERY SUPPORTIVE UM HONESTLY IF I WERE TO QUIT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
PARENTS THAT SAID THAT’S OK THEY WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SUPER DISAPPOINTED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT UM … BUT YEAH THERE WASN’T ANYTHING BIG IT WAS
JUST NOT QUITTING YOU KNOW AND JUST PASSING ALL THE TESTS YOU NEED TO
PASS. AND A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK TOO YOU KNOW, NOT GETTING INJURED, NOT
GETTING CRAZY SICK IS BIG. THAT’S THE ADVICE THAT I ALWAYS GIVE GUYS
GOING THROUGH FIRST PHASE YOU KNOW, JUST TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY
BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET SICK OR INJURED THERE’S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO,
YOU’RE KINDA SCREWED.

WHAT ABOUT ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT VERSUS
THOSE THAT QUIT. NOT THOSE THAT GOT SICK.

UM ANYTHING DIFFERENT … LIKE PERSONALITY WISE?

ANYTHING THAT STANDS OUT IF AT ALL.

FOR ME I FELT LIKE MOST OF THE GUYS THAT MADE IT THROUGH I KINDA KNEW
THAT THEY WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH I DON’T KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

WAS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM? LIKE A DEMEANOR?

YEAH KINDA THEIR DEMEANOR. WE USED TO SAY A LOT IN FIRST PHASE THAT
HE’S GOT THE EYES. LIKE WE KNEW SOMEBODY WAS GONNA QUIT JUST BY LIKE
THEIR DEMEANOR EVERY DAY UM SO JUST THE GUYS THAT THEY COULD BEAT US
ALL DAY LONG AND THEY COULD WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY WITH A GOOD ATTITUDE.
A HUGE THING WAS UM BEING ABLE TO HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR THAT WAS HUGE.
LIKE A TON OF THESE GUYS IN HERE HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR, THAT’S HUGE IN
MAKING IN THROUGH BUD/S UM A LOT OF THE GUYS THAT TOOK EVERYTHING WAY
TOO SERIOUSLY WHEN WE WERE IN PREP AND IN BO, A LOT OF THOSE GUYS DID
NOT MAKE IT. UM SO JUST UM BEING ABLE TO LOCK IT ON WHEN YOU NEED TO
BUT ALSO HAVING A SENSE OR HUMOR WAS BIG FOR ME UM … YEAH JUST GUYS
THAT DON’T TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY, GUYS THAT ARE ABLE TO,
YOU’RE GONNA HAVE A BAD DAY IN BUD/S WHERE YOU GET EMBARRASSED OR
YOU’RE A POOR PERFORMER OR YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT GET CALLED OUT. JUST NOT
LETTING THAT EAT YOU ALIVE … AND THEN JUST GUYS THAT DIDN’T TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT WHAT THE INSTRUCTORS WERE SAYING, NOT TAKING THAT TOO
SERIOUSLY. I SAW A LOT OF INSTRUCTORS GET IN GUYS HEADS AND THEN
THEY’LL QUIT SO BASICALLY JUST NOT CARING ABOUT WHAT AN INSTRUCTOR HAS
TO SAY TO YOU. KINDA JUST KNOWING THE GAME, KNOWING THAT THEY’RE JUST
TRYING TO GET YOU TO QUIT AND NOT TAKING THAT TOO SERIOUSLY.

HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

UM … CHANGE ME AS A PERSON … WHAT DEFINITELY HELPED ME AS FAR AS
GETTING ROLLED THAT JUST HELPED ME TO DEAL WITH FAILURE THAT TAUGHT ME
TO COME BACK A BETTER PERSON. LEARN HOW TO USE THAT AND TURN THAT INTO
A POSITIVE THAT WAS HUGE … UM ITS DEFINITELY MADE ME A LESS SELFISH
PERSON BEING AROUND ALL THESE GUYS YOU KNOW UM JUST DOING WHAT’S BEST
FOR THE CLASS NOT YOURSELF AND SEEING HOW THAT RETURNS AS A POSITIVE
TO YOU. UH AS FAR AS TOUGHNESS AND STUFF, I CAME INTO THIS TELLING
MYSELF I WASN’T GOING TO QUIT AND I NEVER FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO
QUIT SO I DON’T REALLY FEEL LIKE I CHANGED TOO MUCH IN THAT ASPECT UM
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU DO LEARN LIKE HOW FAR YOU CAN PUSH YOURSELF AND UH
HOW FAR YOUR BODY CAN GO BASICALLY IF YOU JUST DON’T GIVE UP UM I FEEL
LIKE THAT’S A LESSON THAT EVERYBODY LEARNS. KINDA A CLICHE LESSON BUT
ITS TRUE … OTHER THAN THAT … I DON’T KNOW UH I’VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
LEADERSHIP I’M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER LEADER. THAT’S SOMETHING THAT
THEY STRESS A LOT HERE AND IF YOU’RE JUST AN E DOG, AN ENLISTED GUY,
BEING ABLE TO STEP UP AND LEAD YOUR BUDDY THAT’S SOMETHING TOO THAT’S
WHAT YOU GET FROM WORKING ON IT. THAT’S SOMETHING I’M NOT GREAT AT BUT
HAVE GOTTEN BETTER AT SINCE I’VE BEEN WORKING ON IT.

GREAT, WE’RE DONE INTERVIEWING.

THAT’S IT? THANK YOU.

CONGRATULATIONS.

 It’s a little formal at the beginning.

 I think you guys got good research, I think it’ll be interesting to
see the results

 It’s been great.

 I think being involved in it was pretty cool.

 Yeah and the first part is already at *cannot understand*. So just
you know I’m recording.

 Got it.

 Uhm, I want to get your participant ID number.

 72

 72… and that’s your informed consent?

 Yes.

 I’ll take that from you, yup, you’re good. Up add a date. Okay.
Perfect! So, first questions are easy then I get to the hard ones.
*laughs*

 That’s fine, whatever you need.

 So...uh… Just tell me a little bit about how many siblings you
have?... Birth order…

 I am the oldest, I have one younger sister, uh, she is three years
younger than me.

 Okay

 I’m 26.

 So one sibling and sister…right?

 Yes.

 uhm, so, if you think about kind of your life experience and what
do you think you would consider kind of your crucible or kind of
life-changing kind of experiences that you’ve gone through.

 Uhm, I think my situation is a little unique.

 mmhm.

 Uhm, I wanted to do this since I was a kid.

 Yeah.

 And my three best friends who I grew up with also wanted to do this
and they’ve all made it through.

 Really?

 They're all in teams now, so I am the last one to make it through.

 Oh interesting.

 I wanted to do it before them, and I’ll put that on the record that
I wanted to do this before them *scoffs* , but yeah uh I need a
medical waiver to get in and it took me three years to get that.

 Okay.

 And that was a big crucible. Like that was A big, very up and down
emotional process because this is all I ever wanted to do and I kind
of just got told by this one doctor that should never allow it.

 Yeah.

 and Uh, here I am, so worked out. It just took three years and a
lot of lot of work. Uhmm, but I grew up in connecticut and uhm I grew
up in a wealthy like a wealthy family.

 Yeah.

 Uhm, struggled, I was a really bad athlete growing up. I struggled
academically. Uhmm and I also didn’t really care that I struggled
academically. I was super concerned with like playing video games that
I thought would bring me closer to this.

 Yeah.

 uhm and then like around 16, my dad sent me to this Navy SEAL
summer camp thinking it would like make me not want to do this anymore
and they had me like jumping out of helicopters and stuff and shooting
guns and I was like “I’m doing that!” And then, uh, a couple years
later, I went to another one that was like really hard, uhm, and I got
through that and that was a big confidence booster for me. And then I
started running ulta-marathons and skydiving, trying to build my
resume for this waiver I needed.

 Yeah.

 So that kind of like span of years, increased my confidence a lot.
So when I came here, I felt like I could handle anything they threw at
me.

 That’s great.

 So that was that was kind of why I think it was unique. Like I lot
of guys didn’t do that kind of stuff.

 So with that kind of mental piece, I mean what was it that kind of
took, like was it your constant pushing to get through that.

 *sighs* My parents would say I’m just stubborn. Uhm, *sighs* I just
wasn’t going to take no for answer, I don’t know how to explain it. I
just like wanted to do this since I was a little kid, I’m gonna uhh,
I’m gonna do it. I was, I remember in college when I made the decision
to have surgery. I had surgery for two herniated disks in my lower
back and I remember like knowing this could jeopardize everything, but
I was in a lot of pain at the time…

 Yeah.

 and uhm, I was like, I made a commitment to myself, I was like if
they say no, I’m gonna fight it to the highest level possible and then
I’m gonna fight even more. And it literally came to that. Like I was
talking to people, *Stutters* not a th president’s level, but in the
White House and stuff...

 Yeah.

 … Trying to make this happen. Ended up not working out that way
anyways. Ended up working at the lower level, but yeah it was a really
long story, but uh I think for me, just ingrained in me, that just
through the process of getting here, like there’s no way I’m not doing
this and plus with all my best friends coming here who are encouraging
me the whole way. I moved out here to live with some of them, so I was
around SEALs. It was… I knew what I wanted to do.

 Yeah, so what about your personality, I mean you said you’re kind
of stubborn, but what about your personality contributed to getting
through BUD/S?

 Uhmm, I don’t know I think I have a good sense of humor, uhm,
pretty disciplined. I like to party a lot which I actually think
helps, I’m not even kidding.

 Yeah, why do you think partying helps?

 Decompression. Most guys I know, I mean, most of my friends party
pretty hard too and, we, we’ve agreed its like a really good way for
us to decompress. This isn’t gonna be shown to the BUD/S staff right?
Cause I like drank every weekend as well.

 No and they won’t even know who it is.

 Oh okay. Yeah I drank the whole weekends, like every weekend, like
even before hell week and everything. Like I would go out dranking with
my buddies and like thathat’s not the best physically for you but like
that was how I decompressed. I feel crazy for saying that was kinda how
I felt with everything. Um Im not like an alcoholic or anything but I
just love that was m;y that was my way to go out and have fun. Um and
you know my buddies would keep encouraging me every weekend I was with
them so that helped and then also sometimes you just have to chill out
and relax um I kinda digress here I think personality wise like I was
training I remember training before coming here because it took me so
long more then I remember Buds, buds how we, Hell week was only a week
first phase is only a like a month, um.. But I remember just being
pretty consistent. Consistency was big um. There were days, like I
really didn't want to do something and I just do it anyways. A lot of
that was peer pressure too because I had my friends there who, they were
showing up to do the workouts too even though none of us wanted to do
it, um… I don't know. I’m not the smartest guy, like I, I just kinda, I
like to think that I was just dumb and just kept going, like one step in
front of the other, or one foot in front of the other.

 Yeah, sometimes that's what it takes.

 Yeah

 What about, I mean you talked about, um our background a little bit
and your family background but what do you think about your background
led you to want to become a Naval officer?

 Um, I remember it kind of evolved over the years. When I was like
really young, I was dead set on like the action hero and the shooting
and all that and like, I never lost that but it matured in that I
remember my dad drove me down the coast of California when I was like 15
and um, I just like, and was like wow we live in an amazing country.
Like, because I grew up on the east coast, we have a beautiful area I
grew up in, this beautiful state and then everything in between all
these great people, I got like very patriotic from that, I never lost
that umm, just the, the real big inspiring factor for me was just being
around SEALs, like I met a lot of them when I was younger and I was
really inspired by their character and just their caliber of men they
were. That just the biggest thing for me.

 Now, were you apart of a military family or?

 No, my father is like a wealthy wall street type guy and my mother
has been a flight attendant for Delta Airlines for forty years. Ummm and
uh noone really in my family was in the military. I don’t know, I wanted
to be a Marine up until I was 10 because I thought they were what SEALs
are and then I found out the difference and I was like “I wanna be a
SEAL.” And if I couldn’t get in the Navy with the waiver I needed, it
was pretty set I was going to go in the Army. I knew like Special
Operations was it for me. I saw it as the best capacity to serve. I saw
it as really high caliber of men. Uhh constantly being challenge, there
were a lot of factors, but I just really wanna do this. I never had to,
at least not so far, I never had to question why I was doing it, the
training, like, there was never a moment where I like I needed to draw
on that. Where I’d here guys, and there’s nothing wrong with it, but I
hear guys who kind of needed to remind themselves. For me, it was just
in my brain, I knew, I knew why I was here.

 So you mentioned your childhood before, what was your parents
parenting style?

 Ummmm hopefully they don’t hear this, my mom’s an alcoholic and was
more or less either not present or just drunk my entire life. I love my
mom, but she has her demons. My father was like the best guy in the
World. He was like my biggest inspiration like he put up with so much
crap grinding through stressful jobs, it really inspired. Ummm, he was
always like he didn’t love that I wanted to do this, but he supported me
and then he made an effort to learn about it and that really really made
proud of him and he was just always there, he would do anything for us,
but also disciplined us when needed because I was somewhat of a deviant
kid growing up. I never got in trouble with the law, but uh I didn;t
make it easy for him, but he still put with it.

 So with that, so with like discipline, how were you kinda
disciplined. Were you spanked? Were you put in time out…?

 I remember being spanked a little bit growing up uhhhhh, my timeouts
and being grounded. I was a little bit of smoozer and I could get my way
out of a lot of punishments, but I, he set an example where I didn’t
want to let my Dad down, so as I got older, I either didn’t do anything
stupid or made sure I wasn’t going to get cut doing it. And big thing to
answer that was we had an open policy where I was pretty honest with him
about most things, so they I was staying out past curfew, they knew I
was drinking underage, they knew my friends were smoking weed and uhhh
they they were pretty cool with it. They didn’t love most things, but
they were a lot laid back then most parents and they gave me the rope to
hang myself at every bit, so uhm.

So I wanted to talk a little bit about your teenage years, so what
kind of activities were you into? Were you into team sports or any other
kind of team maybe not exactly a sport type of activity?

 I ran, uh, track, cross country, I joined the swim my senior year,
when I really got even more serious about coming here. I, uh, in college
I walked on a division 1 crew team. I didn’t stay for very long because
I injured my back. I stayed for like one season, but uh it was never
like official, but my buddies that I mentioned who wanted to do this
with me. I trained with them religiously, in a sense we were our own
little team. We did everything together, we trained together, we partied
together, we hung out together, we got food together together, we
grilled at each others houses, our Dad’s were friends.

 Now were you high school buddies?

 Yeah we all graduated high school the same year. Um so that was my
own little thing, just being with those guys

 *something about ensuring the recorder is still recording* So uhhm
anything else about your teenage that you was formative?

 Noooo…. I wanted to come here at 18 and my dad talked me out of it.
He said go to college. I don’t think I would’ve made it at 18, you could
put that on the record. I mean maybe I would’ve, but I needed my body to
mature, I needed to mentally mature . umm yeah, I don’t think, I
certainly wanted it really bad, but I don’t think, something wouldnt
have worked out.

 Now what about the last five years of your life leading up to BUD/s.
What did you do with that time?

 I worked like random jobs. I had like a dozen different part time
jobs just trying to get this waiver, it was uh. I uhh saw myself leave
at different times. I didn;t get into any like serious work. I was a
lifeguard, at a wine safe awhile, uhh I made hot sauce in New York City.
I learned to like try and do new things umm. I gave swim lessons, I
worked as a grounds keeper on a golf course, uh a caddie, a camp
counselor. Random summer type jobs I just did. I worked at a crossfit
gym out here. I worked as a valet for awhile. Just random stuff like
that, but nothing career wise.

 So what about uhm behaviors. Would you consider yourself like in that
kind of five year time space, compulsive?

 No not compulsive, I was pretty consistent. I had like a routine I’d
like it follow. Spend as much time training as possible. Um and uh
reading, I was really big into reading. Especially since I graduated
college. I got really into reading and exercising the mind just as much
as the body. Um I got really into that, listened to podcasts, just try
to be productive. I had this motto it was like do something productive.
Even if it was listening to podcasts, its better than listening to music
and like I tried to fill as much of time that was possible. There
definitely been ebbs and flows as far as success. Like how I distracted
I get, coming out of BUD/s, I did’t have a lot of free time so I spent
most of it with my friends partying or relaxing in a hot tub or
something or watching movies. Um I just now started reading a book this
morning, I’m getting back into it. That was like the optimal state I
wanted to end up at. That was, I remember before I came into the Navy, I
was kind of at a high point in terms of productivity. Working a ton,
uhh, exercising a ton. My friends all shipped so I wasn;t doing all the
partying as much as I used to and then I came into the Navy and that all
kind of fell apart.

 Now would uh what kind of activities would you do that were
impulsive. Have you done anything impulsive, like do you have any
tattoos?

 No.

 Uhm anything like speeding tickets?

 No, I don;t have any tattoos. I have no uh. I think I got one
speeding ticket in college and I definitely deserved. It was the only I
think I have ever gotten. I never got in trouble with the law. Uhhm, I
don’t know, I try and be transparent as possible here uhm, not super
proud of it, but probably the most influencing thing is like drinking
too much sometimes. Uh definitely, uhm that’s probably the most
impulsive thing and that’s like that probably a product of me being
around I surround the people I spend my time with. They party pretty
hard too and I like up to them. They are all senior to me in the Navy.
Yeah other than that, pretty disciplined.

 What do you think motivates you on a day like where you guys like…?

 Not letting my friends down who are like further along than me.

 Okay.

 Like being the best I can be because potentially some day, people’s
lives can count on it.

 And uhm and when you say your friends that’s the three buddies
that..?

 Yeah and there’s a few more who I knew, I didn’t know them in high
school, but I knew them before they were in the Navy and now they uhh,
they’ve done deployments already and I uhh lived with two of them out
here before they were deployed and they were kind of like mentors to me,
So I look up to them.

 Now uhm *cannot discern* uhm and then what do you think, now more
specifically at BUD/S, what was the most challenging thing, whether it
was a specific day or more of an event?

 Uhh, I never, I preface it with that I never thought about quitting,
like I never seriously contemplated leaving the program, I knew why I
was here. That said, there were times where it was tough to really get
yourself as far as you would be on a good day. Uhm I particularly found
that second phase to be hard mentally. I really struggled with the OC8
test, I went to my last attempt, uhm, I wasn’t crazy about diving, so
that like, I ended up being pretty good at it, but I just didn’t like
it. I don’t the island was a drag, but it was cool. I can tell you the
most painful thing I ever experienced and thing i never want to
experience again was the CS gas on the island where they gassed us. I
don’t know if they prefaced you guys on that. The single worst terrible
thing I ever did in my life. I don’t know even if you’re allowed to talk
about that in your article.

 *laughs* probably not

 They don’t advertise that. That was for sure the worst thing I have
ever done in my life.

 So what motivated you to push through that?

 Uhh not knowing how bad it was. So like they did it. Right as it was
starting, I was like alright let’s go. And then like it makes you want
to just like run away. I remember, I don’t know how or why, but like all
I could focus on was my internal dialogue except it was just so painful
and I was just like stay, stay, stay. I just kept saying stay and just
like trying, knowing it would end really soon because it was only like a
minute and I kind of just rode it out and it ended just like everything
ever does.

 So whether, its that event or other events, was there group support
or was it more individual that was kind of getting you through?

 I don’t remember a lot of like group like come on like guys would try
and do that, I felt like a lot of it was internal, but sometimes I would
get that group support just by looking at another dude and being like
he’s here too. He’s doing it, I’m gonna do it too. There wasn’t a lot of
like cheerleading, but just being in the presence of other guys was
enough for me. Some people may feel differently. I don’t know I wasn’t
perfect in this program either, like I…

 Its okay, were there any specific practices whether physical,
spiritual, or mental that you used to help you get you through
challenges?

 Yes, big thing for me, was positive self talk, setting micro goals,
uhm visualization was huge for the testing stuff. Uhm and uh *pause* I
kind of had some mantras in my head like positive mantras that I would
just recite. I did a lot of counting down from 10 when things got bad. I
just count to 10 and then back down, up and down from 10 just to like
focus on something. The single biggest thing was setting micro goals
like just like taking things one bite at a time. That was huge and I
learned that from a SEAL who made me practice it like before I joined
the Navy, I did a 50 mile Ultra Marathon and that was harder for me
because I didn’t like have that micro goal thing down and I had to like
learn it on the fly and then I came here and I had had the muscle memory
so that helped a lot. And I remember being in hell week thinking like
I’ve been here before.

 Just like keep going.

 Yup.

 What do you think, here at BUD/S, what do you think went through your
mind when trying to make that difficult decision?

 uhm what difficult decision?

 Uhm any difficult decision whether it was ethical whether it was
just…?

 Uhm how would this look to the other guys. Would this be viewed
favorably by the guys that I care about or just…

 Do you have any specific examples?

 No, not off the top of my head. Uh, sometimes like, I remember we had
to like hit the surf at night and you were already wet. No one could see
if you did it or not and there would be a debate whether I could get
away with not doing and uhh I always knew that it would be like not
favorable to do it because every one else was doing it. So it was just
like cutting corners like that where you couldn’t really hurt anyone,
you might get a little more comfort out of it, uhm, but I remember just
being inspired by the dudes to not take that choice, so.

 Yeah, Why do you think you were successful at BUD/S?

 oh geez, uhm luck, luck and uhm uhh just still trying to figure that
out honestly. I think the ability to take things one step at a time.
That for me was, personally, was the single biggest thing, just those
little micro goals. Just taking one little bite of something and then
two, three, four, five and next thing you know you’re halfway done and
then you’re on the downhill. Like i remember hell week like before it
started when you’re in the tent and everybody was all nervous. I didn’t
think a second after Tuesday morning. I was like if I am still here
Tuesday morning, I know I am going to make it because I am like so close
to getting all the hard stuff done even though we still had like days
left. I knew like a lot of the hard stuff was done by like Tuesday
night, Wednesday. So I was like just get to Tuesday morning and then
you’re a few hours away from there, I can do anything for a few hours
and then it’s kind of just like auto pilot, so I did that and then
Tuesday morning came and I was like there’s no doubt in my mind.

 Yeah, what do you think made the difference, like did you notice any
difference between you and the people that didn’t make it?

 Some really good guys didn’t make it. Some of my close friends didn’t
make it. For me, I think it was just like how long it took me to get
here. I feel like my commitment had already been tested. Uhm, I had been
around guys who before I came here who would look at dudes who quit and
be like oh like screw that guy blah blah, he’s weak. I don’t feel that
way about at all about guys. I think there’s some great dudes who didn’t
make it, definitely some luck involved like how hurt a guy is or
whatever. Uhm, I don’t know, for me personally, I really don’t feel that
much different then a lot of those guys. I think maybe it was just that
I wanted this more. I certainly could tell you that athletically, I
wasn’t better than a lot of them, I just was committed, so.

 Okay that’s it.

OK. Is it okay if I record that interview?

Yes.

And then you're participant ID numbers.

Seventy three, and three four eight.

OK. Seventy three and three Forty eight. So easy questions first. Um
what class BUDS class did you start in.

Uh 338.

OK.

Got rolled into 339.

And when did you get rolled into 339?

In second phase first, OC-8.

OK. How many siblings do you have?

I'm one of five.

Wow, OK. And what's the birth order?

I have an older sister, I'm second. And then a younger brother, he's the
middle guy he's kind of weird. And then one sister and the littlest is a
brother,.

Ok, Sister.

Older sister. Younger sister. Two younger brothers

So you're number two?

Yes.

Um, and then what's your situation? Two parent household are those from
the same parents, all 100 percent full siblings?

Yeah.

Um, and then what's your kind of relationship with their parents? Close?

Yeah we're really close. My whole family is pretty much I mean, just
really close, yeah.

[Uh, where did you grow up?

I grew up all over the place. I was born in Wyoming.

OK

And didn't live there very long and moved to a Eskimo village in Alaska.

OK

Then I moved from there to Central America for three years and then I
moved to Guam.

And so what took you guys moving all around?

We were Christian missionaries.

OK.

And then he joined the army.

OK.

Went to Hawaii.

Got it. He's still in the army?

Not anymore. He's out.

And so were they you woulds all were all part of as Christian move?

Uh the first two.

First two and then others were Army move?

Yeah.

Um any sort of life changing events that happened to you prior to coming
to BUDS.

Nope, not really.

Nothing like the higher level?

Pretty average.

Tell me a little bit about your personality. What's that like and how is
that contributed to getting through BUDS?

I would say I mean, since I've had to move around a lot, I mean, I've
gotten pretty good at making friends really easily.

OK

Cause I leave them and then I make new ones. But I'm pretty social for
the most part. But I'm really quiet sometimes. I get some pretty
energetic in the mornings, a lot of guys get annoyed by that.

Hahaha. What led you to want to become a SEAL?

So initially like I always kind of knew. I didn't really know what like
America was growing up in, like, little Eskimo village. I didn't really
hear about a whole lot about the homeland, I guess.

Yeah.

And then when I moved to Central America, I didn't really know anything
about America besides home schooling. What I learned uh in textbooks.

Yeah.

But then I was like, I have this great idea of bing like a soldier
that's like cool to me. I don't know why. And then I saw, like, I kind
of found out what it was about, like a trailer in a movie that I wasn't
allowed to watch.

OK

So that's how kinda I found out about it.

How old were you when you kind of?

Like eight years old?

OK

So it kind of developed from there into something, obviously. It's like
you're rocking the chair a little bit. That is kind of more
romanticized. That's cool. It's still cool, but it's like. Yeeah now
there's like a purpose behind it.

Yeah. And you said, so your dad join the army after you were born.

Yes. We were I was 10 years old.

OK

He joined the army, we moved to Hawaii. And that was our first and only
duty station.

OK

So I spent kinda the more all my teenage years or still a teenager but
spent more of its formative years there in Hawaii.

OK And how long and where do you go after Hawaii?

I went to Kansas City for nine months.

OK

And we finished high school. Yes, Virginia Beach for five years.

OK Anybody else? The military and your family or around you, your
friends.

Yeah grandpa.

OK

And then great-grandpa

Were they Army or Navy?

Yeah, Army then one was a Marine.

OK

Great grandpa was Marine Corps in World War II. They don't really talk
about it.

Yeah.

You know, I didn't really receive any influence for me.

OK Um what about your your childhood was specifically about like
discipline.

Spankings.

Spanking? You're the first person that's answered that.

Really?

Yeah, I mean, other people have said that just just immediately you have
an answer for me.

Yeah, spankings. We didn't do time out. I don't even know like. I mean,
it guess it could be useful, but it's definitely there's something to be
said about kids misbehaving, spank em, shake them up I guess.

Yeah.

Hahaha.

Do you think that helped?

I definitely think so. Obviously not in the moment. But looking back, I
mean, respect the style of parenting.

Yeah.

Very. Not like strict strict parents but definitely like firm. You know,
you're being a little naughty boy I mean obviously.

Um, what about. So we talked about you moving kind of throughout your
childhood when you were like in Alaska. What were your ages for all
these differen moves that you had.

So, Wyoming, I think, it was like when I spent my first year of life
there.

OK.

Then turned five in Alaska.

OK.

Almost six moved to Central America, that is where my mom is from.

OK.

Grew up from like six to almost 11, almost 11 years old.

OK.

I mean, almost. Hawaii 10-11 to 17.

OK.

And then 18 I moved to Missouri.

Got it.

Or 18 in bootcamp.

In bootcamp ok. And so you did a high school and then went right to boot
camp. Nothing in between.

Uh, I spent five months in Virginia.

Ok.

Just moving with my family.

OK

For me, it wasn't a lot of downtime.

Yeah. So you just graduated high school, went to Virginia Beach with
them and then.

Left.

OK So when you finish high school, did you knew you were going to join
the military?

Yes, Ma'am.

Um and what about during your teenage years? Did you do any sports or do
any? Let's head back to this.

I surfed a lot in Hawaii a bit some competitive surfing. But not too
much. I had, like, this dream of, like going pro, but obviously, like,
it's not going to happen obviously.

Yeah.

But um, I played soccer and I don't know, I kind of heard. My buddy
Swartz were talking about like, each sport he played was his favorite
sport. Like I kind of switch interest a lot.

Yeah.

Things that I took an interest in, like surfing. I was like, oh, well,
that's surfing. You know, when I started soccer. I'm like, OK, forget
surfing I'm all about soccer. It's kind of like that. And that was the
sport I played all the way through. And after, through high school.

OK Um anything about kind of being part of that sport that you think
like as a team helped you here? Blend into the

Honestly, I would say no. Just cause like I feel like I didn't really
play on like a team, whereas like I was rather good.

Yeah.

Uh, I played on it like a travel soccer team. Everyone comes from
different schools. But you all come together.

Yeah.

To play and you're not like they were all pretty good friends but I was
new to the team. So they have like as deep friendships.

Uh huh.

I was just there to play and we all pretty much love playing as one
team. That was one thing we had in common. I don't know. Definitely
nothing, really. I mean, here it is so much different.

In what way?

Just that, like, we're all actually like good friends.

Yeah.

More so, like instead of just we're just playing with the other like
here it's like we're playing together. It's so like for reall.

Yeah.

We're bros. And friends outside of work. I mean the stakes are a lot
higher obviously.

Yeah so we can we can talked about it but I'm just trying to make sure
I'm clear. So if you think about the last five years of your life
leading up to being here, so you had high school, Virginia Beach and
then boot camp right? And then when did you go to boot camp?

So February 4th went boot camp.

Twenty nineteen?

2019

Uh so you're kind of one of the younger younger people here. Uh how do
you think that played into your experience here?

I definitely think like right off the bat, you kinda have to earn the
guys respect.

Yeah.

Especially, cause you're that younger, you kinda have to show up ok I'm
I can't be immature and not just, you know. But we'll find games all the
time.

Yeah.

You know, there's times when you have to turn that off enough. I always
say like it's kind of like a dial, dial it on for work or turn it back.
But I definitely think as like you go on and prove yourself that they
perceive for like what what work you're capable of doing? Rather than
your age and being like ok he's young and like you can't work hard. So,
I mean, it kind of in first phase. It definitely was more of a hurdle.
Cause like everyone's so new.

Yeah.

And then, as you know, now coming back from the island it's like, OK,
I'm the same as him.

Yeah.

In all aspects.

Makes sense. How about do you consider yourself impulsive at all?

Yes.

In what ways?

Every way. No, haha.

Hahaha.

I would say one way that I really need to work on is I have a hard time
saying no to people. So if I have plans to go do something and someone
like, you know, you want to go do this and say yes to that right away
without even thinking about it. Ok, I already have all these other plans
that I said yes too. That's one way. I'm definitely like, it's a bad
thing that I'm impulsive. So I've been trying to get my finances under
wraps.

Yeah.

Which is definitely good to do at a younger age. But you know I've
gotten away from impulsive buying.

Yeah. So you say that you have some impulsive buying, like.

Sometimes.

Purchases.

Yeah. It's just like food related stuff.

OK

Like I don't need to go eat out. Oh, there it is.

But not like going to buy a car or like.

I did buy a car after Hell Week that I needed to.

But it wasn't, yeah. It was something you needed. What about tattoos
anything like that?

(intelligible)

Um, what do you think the most challenging component of BUDS was?

The gas.

The gas. What might've been that?

Got me through it?

Yeah.

It was that I couldn't breathe that I couldn't run away, no but uh I
don't know. I guess I didn't really have to think about it. I was just
going to be there.

Yeah.

It's not like I didn't have to think, like, OK, we're going to stay like
it's. Everything else you can kinda just do but that's like something
that we've never been exposed to. It was weird to go through something
in here like something that'll make grown men scream in pain.

Yeah.

And like I don't know as I play something, even though it's so short,
it's pretty intense.

Yeah, but you think like you got through it just by literally you're,
you're not going to do anything else but get through it.

Yeah, I had no like second thoughts. Like think it's something I can do
just another thing.

Anything else that you think was like you would top up there with the
gas experience here at BUDS?

OC-8. I mean, getting rolled for that, definitely like there is a couple
times, where I was like ok, can I do this? Yeah that I was kind of a
little bump.

Yeah. What got you past that?

Definitely just taking the time to just put in work like hours of dirt
diving.

OK

Through all these possible situations and then going into it confident.
Cause it's really easy to be like I got rolled for this. This could send
me home very easily. Just being confident when, you know there's no
reason to be confident.

Anything, whether it was physical or mental or spiritual, that's in
addition you thing got you through this BUDS experience in general?

I would say what I get from my girlfriend. Just that, you have a really
strong relationship. Just being able to be like, OK, today was a bad day
today sucked and if I can look forward to calling her and, you know,
almost in a way like you're a baby a little bit.

Yeah.

It's kind of nice, almost even though, like, you know, we're all like
whatever tough guys, I guess. But it's nice to be babied sometimes.

Yeah. Where is she?

She's in Florida.

OK

So it's been all long distance for a while.

Um, anytime you had to make a difficult decision here at BUDS like a
ethical and moral decision, whether it was personal or watching somebody
else maybe do something that wasn't enough.

Yeah, for sure. There's definitely like for a lot of ways that you can
cheat here at BUDS like. And it's a lot of things like you have to be
the man and be like, OK, I'm going to consciously make a decision not to
do that. Like especially like staying out after curfew. I know like, and
lying about certain things. Like here's one of the circumstances I'm not
gonna name anything in particular. He's still actually in the program.
And he had lied to one of the instructions about not having a vehicle
when they were doing vehicle inspections. You know, he was my roommate
at the time. And so I knew about it. And I did tell him either you're
going to, like, say something and he had some contraband hidden in his
car so I did like to tell the officers in the class, which I mean, like
there's there's a certain point where it's like, okay, are you just kind
of protecting the bad guys? Like yeah. You might have made it past Hell
Week but or are you just harboring guys? Are you trying to protect those
guys? Are you actually trying to do the right thing? Even if they did
make it through Hell Week or whatever.

Yeah. So do you feel like was that a struggle to kind of decide what to
do or do you feel like.

Not really.

Yeah.

I think the hardest thing was like confronting people because I'm such
like I'm an easygoing guy. It's hard for me to sometimes talk about
things that carry weight.

Yeah.

Like I'm not. I don't have a hard time being serious at work. But it's
like, okay, I'm confronting this guy, so you go about differently. I
mean, face to face it's a little bit harder.

Reality of it. Why do you think you were successful in completing BUDS?

Um, I don't know. Like finishing BUDS and being like successful, like
conquering it. I feel are different in my mind.

Hahaha.

I struggled a lot. I told a lot of the instructors they were like, oh,
good on you like making it through at 18 and I'm like, man, I. I was
such a wuss at so many different things. I wish in hindsight I should
have waited probably. But maybe just like I just never thought about
quitting as an option.

Yeah.

It's really cliché to say but.

Why was quitting not an option for you.

Just because the guys are here and they're doing it like like why can't
I? Like I don't want to let them down.

Yeah.

Another big thing and like, this is something I want to do. I really
don't have to good of an answer for that.

No it's ok What are the, what do you think the differences between the
people who have made it and the people that did quit, specifically the
ones that quit.

Ok. um, so I think a lot of guys and I know this is not for everyone,
but they lose desire for it.

OK

Or they didn't have the desire in the first place. Like, I know a lot of
guys who had gotten rolled twice or once in they're like in that
in-between period when you're not in it for a long time.

Yeah.

And you can lose desire for what you're doing. I know like getting
rolled, I had to like reignite that flame.

Yeah.

And uh, but I know a lot of guys who. Also switching ideas, guys who
didn't even want to do the job in the first place. A lot of guys just
want to be a SEAL and not really do job because it is pretty. I mean,
the further you go on you realize that it's so much more then. It's
harder then, then just making it through Hell Week.

Yeah, there's a lot more to it.

Yep.

So how has this experience changed you as a person? If at all?

I feel like it's like coming into being a homeschooler, like kind of not
being sheltered, like living in my own bubble.

Yeah.

It's definitely blinded my. My world view of like. Meaning so many
different people. That helps me. Discern like, because I have beliefs
and what I believe. And then, like, it's kind of putting that to the
test.

Yeah.

On my own. You know, a lot of people can get swept away and like kind of
just become an imprint of what their environment is. And so being able
to stay alone. What you believe? Not even what you grew up believing but
what you believe it's right. I didn't know that. It kinda was is a big
lesson I had to learn. Be my own person not.

Yeah.

Being totally. Because there's a lot of peer pressure in life and decide
that and grow up and be like yo, this what I'm about. This is what I'm
about to do. This is what going to do. I think a lot of guys can respect
me for that.

Yeah.

Just because, you know, even though I am really young. They see like. Ok
he's about this. Even though they may not agree with it. They can still
respect it.

And you think um because were you homeschooled your whole life?

For most of my life, I went to private Christian school for a little
bit.

Do you think um that really played a role on that being kinda your own
human being? Person?

A little bit. I mean, I was definitely like not a troublemaker.
Definitely not a troublemaker. I just kinda like kinda do my own thing.
Like free spirit.

Hahaha um anything else that I didn't ask, do you think he may help us
with this study?

No, I'm not very qualified to talk about any of this, actually. I.

No you're great. You're perfectly qualified.

I'm just here because I don't know it's lot of luck too.

Yeah.

I think someone said I'm sure a lot have.

Yeah. A lot of people say that. Yeah. Ok well great I'm finished.

Thank you.

Thank you. Congratulations.

Thank you. I appreciate it

And If I could ask you to state your participant ID and is it ok if I
record

yes

ok so this survey is anonymous and um (Unintelligible, lots of static
feedback)

So I'm gonna start by asking How many siblings do you have?

I have one sister uh casey she's 11 months older than I am

ok sure 11 months older ok great and if you think about your life
experience what would you describe as your crucible or life changing
experiences.

umm I did a kairos retreat in highschool

ok

um it’s like I’m not like super religious but that was kinda like a
cool experience

ya

turned to like strengthening relationships with family

ok

my dad especially um and then honestly I think uh

Was he on that retreat with you?

No he wasn’t but it was kinda like a a like we wrote letters and
stuff

ya

like him and I always sort of had a strange relationship but that
kinda brought us together a little but

ya

and then uh going to Navy I think for me uh I needed discipline in
my life at the time and uh I think it was uh really good for me and then
getting into trouble at the Naval Academy like a lot uh it was uh kinda
took me from not not not so good pat and turned me around

ya

kinda forced me to look myself in the mirror and uh change a lot of
things

so making mistakes while you were there

yes

working through it ok um how did those experiences factor into your
experience here at buds?

um I mean I think I took the value of relationships early on and uh

ok

also like I was very familiar what it felt like to fail

ok

so and I think that’s what messes with guys a lot out here you got
these all american guys who come out here and theyve never failed before
and uh you got someone whose royally messed up and uh they know what
it’s like and then I think it helps from a leadership perspective you
know give guys second chances and then knowing which guys are worth
working with and so I think those kids

ya how do you think your personality contributed to your progression
through buds

um

do you remember your personality from pre then

um I was trying to recall things but no no I don't remember as much
as I should

personality like your openness, variableness, conscientiousness,
extroversion , neuroticism

oh well oh ya I think um i’m a pretty light hearted guy

ya

and having a sense of humor is a huge thing for buds like

ok

if your able to laugh about your current situation

ya

then it makes it so much better

ya

um so I think that’s huge cause I always found myself doing that and
you know when your running to hit the surf and that’s the last thing you
want to do it’ll be like what the hells going on right now

ya

something like that something I thought that was something I enjoyed
so ya

ya anything else? Extroversion, introversion

ya I think extroversion was huge to I think uh like as an officer
like that was good cause like being extroverted like your not always
gonna be uh you can’t really be introverted and I don’t think and have
it work like to a certain extent you can but uh

ya

going in and having that extroversion like uh reaching out and uh
being able to talk to guys was huge and then uh I found like uh guys who
were drawn like to certain people like who responded well to that

ya

I mean most most of these guys are extroverted

ya

but there;s maybe like five guys that i would consider introverts
out of our class of like sixty so uh

ok

extroverts are all attracted to each other

ya ok so describe your background that led you to pursue becoming
part of the SEAL community

I grew up I grew up in the upper middle class probably my dad was a
marine so I wanted to be in the military for a long time,

ya

he was enlisted so when I wanted to join the military he pointed me
towards the Naval Academy just cause like I don’t think he loved being
enlisted and I think he saw the opportunities that an officer had and uh
he’s like dude if you’re gonna do it do it right

ya

and then I joined like in my pre-teen years and I like hated the
idea and then uh went to highschool and got hit with the travis manion
uh story cause he went to my high school and then uh so i wanted to be a
marine for a while

Travis Mannion went to your highschool

yes um so that got me really interested in the Naval Academy and had
the opportunity to play lacrosse there and then you play lacrosse at
Navy Brendan Looney comes into play big time and so that kinda shifted
me towards the uh towards the SEAL teams

tell me alittle about your childhood I’m particularly interested in
discipline and your family parenting style so was there splaning, uh
timeout, grounding, loss of privileges, uh taking your video games away,
soap in mouth

ya so my dad like was a marine right so like I had a shaved head I
had a buzz cut till I was in 8th grade

ok

um very disciplined I had like certain chores I had to do everyday
every weekend and they had to be done right like my dad would go out and
inspect the garage after I swept it and if wasn’t good I had to do it
again

ok

and I thought he was just being a dick but like I realized he’d
always tell me that’d I’d thank him one day and like now I’m looking
back I have like some sort of like discipline and I had I’m able to like
follow through on things and do things right like the first time and I’m
like holy crap he was right but ya uh a belt was a thing my mom was like

spanking with belt

ya uh loss of stuff like taking away whatever game system or my cell
phone or grounding I was all in um

loss of privileges

ya uh like that so ya it was definitely like very strict my dad was
very strict in terms of what I wore what my sister wore like how we wore
our hair like if my hair was messy he’d tell me I looked homeless

How about your teenage years did you move around a lot what was when
he was a marine were you

no so uh he joined the reserves when I was born and then retired at
40 so he was in the reserves when I was young and then uh

so you stayed in the same like

So I grew up in Southern Philadelphia and stayed there my whole life
from like one town over cause my dad started a new company

ya so the sports in highschool and then in college lacrosse

yes

for one and then uh that’s D1 uh D1 uh and anything else you were
invovled in that had a close or tight knit community so other activities
or other

uh just pretty much just uh sports

ok

uh multiple different sports teams

ok

uh I I was in a a playing community service group in high school

ok

uh that was pretty cool, battalion service club

ok

so that was pretty cool

ok what other sports besides lacrosse did you

football was my other bug one then I wrestled for one year

ok

just staying shape

ok cool uh so the last five years prior to BUD/s tell me about you
were at the Academy did you decide it’s busy at the academy did you do
anything else like travel or other experience

ya uh traveled a lot especially that my TAD year because I had a
like a predump just cause I was like (unintelligible)

ya

so I traveled a lot then a Ireland once and then like all over the
country visiting guys and then uh that was one trip but ya I uh did a
lot did a lot in the general Annapolis area uh pretty busy went to DC
and Baltimore all the time

would you consider yourself impulsive

probably I think uh ya I would say if it’s for a good reason I'm
down

ok do you have any tattoos

I don’t no

ok um do what about speeding tickets or

ya uh I actually got one right before we headed out I was trapped
down in Virginia Beach and my if you're going on the eatern shore side
so I was going like 81 in a 45 or something like that

ok

reckless driving technically so that was part of the deal with
during first phase

ok so did you have to go to court

I I got an attorney to go on my behalf Originally they said no you
have to go cause it was a misdemeanor

ok

but I I got an attorney to get me out of the ticket but he got me
out of the court

anything else that would be impulsive or kinda reckless behavior

ya I got in some trouble so I put this like the interview so it’s
like the interview for destruction of property plebe year, it’s just
like breaking stuff uh I paid for it so uh

were you drunk

ya ya

so alcohol related incidents

ya a few of those um not anymore um ya so

um what motivates you on a daily basis

I think my family for sure

ok

uh and uh definitely like not letting these guys down I think being
like being a part of a team like that’s been such a constant in my life
since the fourth grade when I started sports

ya

it’s just so the better you do the better everyone does and uh just
being driven by that like I live with guys and one of them is going to
workout after this and now I’m going so it’s just like trying to get
better and just competitions

like competition and peer pressure in a good way

ya I think competition are like ya ya I think peer Ya positive peer
pressure

ya

which is stimulated by this kind of environment

what was the most challenging part of buds so think about buds was
there a day or an event where you were just like really

I hated the uh the uniform inspections the most cause I was like
probably gonna fail and uh that was just like a shot to the heart cause
you would spend so much time and you just ya I didn’t like those but all
the physical stuff was particularly bad and like we went through like a
summer class so it wasn’t like that cold so you gotta get to the guys
who are going through first phase now it’s really cold

ya

but no I thought uniform I hated that stuff cause you spent so much
time

what motivated you to push through it when things were hard

like the uniform inspections specifically

like really hard right where you felt yourself maybe having doubts or

I think like the legacy like there's never been a navy lacrosse
player to quit buds so I wasn't gonna be the first apparently uh there's
more like asterisks but it's kinda like medical type thing um so like um
so like as I was told before going in so like you don’t wanna be that
guy right then um one of my classmates uh told me this one thing uh it’s
like you so when you quit you put your helmet on the grinder right so
your your name is on the ground so

ya

so your putting your name like down in the dirt

ya

and I’m like I’m not gonna let that

ya

I don’t want like your name to be associated with a quitter

family name um helmet

ya which gets put on the grinder and everyone walks by they are like
dang they are literally looking down at it right

ya

it's like a symbolic thing for me and I’m not gonna let that happen

ya are there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used
to push through the challenges pray meditate

I’m not really religious but I pray ummm

how about like you know being an athlete or rituals or workouts or
games like the that get you ready physically ready and mentally

I would like eat sing and get breakfast every morning

ok

every morning I had a frosted mini wheats and watermelon

ok

and watermelon and I had a good day one day like the first day so I
was like this must be the reason why

ok

and so I like every day that we had breakfast in buds I had a and
besides that i don't know I’m pretty ritualistic or superstitious oh
like like uh I wore like I wore like the same shirt a lot or like uh
someone had a good idea was like every not first phase in first phase I
got fifteen shirts right because they were work days and I’d just throw
white shirt out at the end of the day and I’d start each day with a
fresh white shirt

ok

just stuff like that i guess but like by uh like in second phase you
have all the pool comp stuff so I’d wear the same brown shirt everyday
till I like failed and then switch it and start a new one and then in
third phase which sounds gross but I mean it is kinda gross and but then
in third phase I did that same thing too it’s like I’d pass one qual and
I’d just keep wearing the same shirt till I passed the next one and then
changed eventually but things were going good so if it ain’t broke don’t
fix it right

ok when you made a difficult, can you think of a difficult decision
you made during training and what went through your mind as you made
that decision so can you give me an example of a tough decision and I
know you don’t make many decisions for yourself when you’re at buds but

ya

were there any

um

that you can think of

I think like the peer ranking were difficult decisions I actually did
make one there was a guy in my uh I’m not sure if I did the right thing
or not but there was a really young guy in our in our group group he was
like 19 fresh out of high school he was an absolute stud of a performer
but like super immature like uh we told him that before and it’s kinda
getting out of hand with like talking saying things at inappropriate
times like he’ll make really really bad and I was his fireteam leader
and I put him in my bottom five and I wrote in there I don't think he’s
a bad performer and I think he should be here but I think he needs to
have a tough conversation about maturity right but then like everyone
knows who the bottom five are right and I was talking to one of the
instructors he came up and I talked out it and kinda publicly shamed the
guy when I coulda taken more of a mentor role and so that’ll be a tough
decision that I made that didn’t end up working out and made me kinda
like ok maybe I shoulda tried harder but here is one way in buds when I
coulda been an officer so after that I shifted tried to be more of a
mentor role cause I was like six years older than the guy and it ended
up working out

so the decision you made was to use the

use the box

use the ranking system

yes when and I put the disclaimer in there like hey I don;t think
he’s a bad performer but ya so that would be a tough decision I made
that ended up teaching me something about like that peer relationships
or something that you can do rather than publicly shame somebody

ok so what went through your mind when you made that decision when
you used the formal peer ranking as the tool

um I didn’t feel comfortable going up to the instructors saying hey
can you go and talk to this guy

ya

the I realized that would have been much much better than just like
writing a little blurb on the hey I don’t think he's actually that bad
you know um

ya

so I think that would have been so that's where I learned like maybe
I think I was hiding behind it a little bit cause I didn't really know
exactly what to do so I chose the easy the less comfortable option

ya

so (long pause)

ok um why do you think you were successful why do you think you were
successful getting through buds

uh

and why do you think others did not make it

I think I have like a really really strong support system coming
from my family friends and then uh guys I was really close with out here
like I mean I lived with five other four other O’s who were all in my
class so I knew a bunch of dudes I think I had a lot of reasons to be
here and I didn't really have another option I think that was it like we
were doing this or like going to the fleet like I can’t and not like
coming back and I think like I just wanted it for a long time

ok

ok I don;t know I wasn’t but ya I think the support system was huge

ok did you notice anything different about those that didn’t make it

ya

there trends

ya I think guys didn’t make it but have a plan b um ya I think a lot
of people did or or they started looking for them and you have a bad day
and it’s not really that bad right something like that right

ya

you know for us it’ll be like you know what would suck right now the
bridge you know that would suck you know I’m cold but at least I’m not
standing a four hour watch on the the fucking aft you know look out you
know what i mean I’d say something like tha but uh

ya ok anything else?

no you kinda hear the same stuff uh oh it's just not for me so I
respect the guys that realize that what what is worse is the people who
know it’s not for them but don’t want to quit and drag the other guys
down I thought that was I had no respect for those guys but the guys who
were man enough to just say hey this this is not for me like I’m out
like no no ill will towards those guys but ya its the ones who like and
like you hear people say some people say I know I’m not performing but
I'm not quitting

ya

it’s like you’re you’re old prune but you’re one sixth of this and
it’s like it doesn’t matter if you do that in second phase like you
you’re by yourself right

ya

first phase its like all team

ya

so its like that pisses me off and then they would get rolled or
dropped or whatever but I don't feel bad for them because they aren’t a
good teammate

alright did this experience at buds change you

I’d say so um confidence I think uh cause there was a lot of things
that a lot of question marks a lot of like gut checks that you have to
pass to get through and it’s like well I’ve done this so I can do that
so I’m looking forward to the next challenge it’s more academic its JOTC
so its like going to school again but no I think that that would be the
things ya it’s just you have that

ya

tool belt I remember ya

uh is there anything else that we didn’t talk about that you want to
share anything that you think would be helpful for the research team
anything you think we should be asking

no I think you guys pretty much covered it all ya I can’t really
think of anything

ok awesome I’ll turn this off

LIKE BEING WITH THEM EVERY DAY HELPED A LOT LIKE SEEING THEM GO
THROUGH THE SAME STUFF NOT WANTING TO LET THEM DOWN KINDA THING

OK

PRETTY MUCH NOT WANTING TO LET THEM DOWN WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
MOTIVATION PIECE

OK YA WERE THERE ANY PRACTICES PHYSICAL MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL THAT YOU
USED TO PUSH THROUGH THE CHALLENGES?

OTHER THEN JUST LIKE GETTING

PURP MEDITATION LIKE A STRETCHING ROUTINE

NO OTHER THAN JUST LIKE PREPARING BEFORE AND WORKING OUT AND STUFF
NOTHING SPECIFIC ON THAT ONE

WHEN YOU MADE A DIFFICULT DECISION DURING TRAINING BUD/S WHAT WENT
THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU MADE THAT DECISION, CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE?

UMM (LONG PAUSE) UH I GOT REALLY NOTHING SORRY

OK WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU HAVE ANY

DECISION OK WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT, NO DIFFICULT DECISION

I CAN’T REALLY THINK IT’S KINDA ALL JUST A BLUR

OK WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S SO WHY
WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL AND WHY DO YOU THINK OTHERS DIDN’T COMPLETE

UM PREPARATION I THINK

OK

A BIG ONE

YA

COMING FROM THE ACADEMY I KINDA THINK WE HAVE AN ADVANTAGE FORM THE
START BECAUSE COMPARED TO THE ENLISTED GUYS WE HAVE ALL THE PRIOR
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT AND KNOWING PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME
THING BEFOREHAND KINDA GET THEIR EXPERIENCE FROM IT AND CAN LEARN FROM
THAT

OK

AND THEN ALSO JUST I THINK I’M VERY NOT NECESSARILY STUBBORN BUT I
DON’T LIKE IF I;M GONNA DO SOMETHING I DON’T WANT TO QUIT ON IT I GUESS
SO

CAN I USE THE WORD TENACIOUS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

UHH NOT REALLY

GONNA WRITE TENACIOUS, OK DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT
DIDN’T MAKE IT? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

I THINK SO NOT LIKE HAVING THEIR HEART KIND OF IN IT IF THEIR JUST
KINDA DOING IT ON A WHIM I THINK THAT THOSE LIKE A LOT OF THOSE GUYS
QUIT UMM SOME OF IT’S PROBABLY LUCK BUT I THINK MOST OF IT IS JUST I
THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT QUIT THEY MAKE THE DECISION AHEAD THAT
THEY ARE GONNA QUIT I THINK IT’S MORE MENTAL THAN PHYSICAL

OK SO YOU DON’T THINK IT WAS A LACK OF THEIR PHYSICAL STRENGTH

CAUSE ALL ALL IN AROUND HAD I THINK

UMM

FOR FOR MENTORING

UH YA HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON

MAJORITY OF THE TIME AND THAT YOU CAN PUSH THROUGH LIKE A LOT MORE THAN
YOU THINK YOU COULD

I WENT TO IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY.

AND YOU DID FOUR YEARS THERE?

YES, I GRADUATED IN 3.5 YEARS.

DID YOU GO STRAIGHT INTO THE MILITARY AFTER THAT?

I WAS IN BOOTCAMP TWO MONTHS LATER.

OCS OR ENLISTED?

ENLISTED.

ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK FACTORED INTO YOUR EXPERIENCES HERE AT BUD/S?

UH MY FAMILY ALWAYS … SPORTS … WE WERE ALWAYS PUSHED IF YOU’RE GOING TO
DO SOMETHING DO IT RIGHT. MY DAD WAS AN ENGINEER WENT TO MIT, MY OLDER
BROTHER DOES VERY VERY GOOD IN SCHOOL AND IS AN INVESTMENT BANKER NOW.
WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD TO GO FOR ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IF WE WERE GOING TO
DO SOMETHING. THAT WAS BIG IN OUR HOUSE, OUT IN THE BACKYARD WE WERE
VERY VERY ACTIVE AS KIDS AND THE WAY MY DAD PUSHED US WE DID VERY WELL
IN SCHOOL BUT I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH AND BE A PART OF
SOMETHING GREATER.

DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A SEAL OR WAS THAT LATER ON IN LIFE?

UH… AT 17 I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO BUT I DON’T THINK I HAD THE MATURITY
AND PHYSICALITY TO DO IT SO I DECIDED TO GO THROUGH COLLEGE AND KIND OF
REASSESS LATER. AND TOWARDS THE END OF COLLEGE I DECIDED THAT I WANTED
TO DO IT. I DIDN’T REALLY LOOK AT ANY OTHER UNIT OR ANY OTHER PLACE IN
THE MILITARY BESIDES THIS.

IS THERE ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY THAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO SPECIAL FORCES?

UH … I ACTUALLY FOUND OUT LATER MY DAD WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT BEING A
SEAL BACK BEFORE HIS LOVE OF ENGINEERING KIND OF TOOK OVER. BUT UH I
DON’T KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS KIND OF PUSHED TO DO LIKE THE BEST SO I KNEW I
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING WITH SPECIAL OPERATIONS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY’RE
SPECIAL. AND THAT’S WHEN I FOUND THAT THE SEALS WERE THE BEST OF THE
BEST.

TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY AND HOW YOU THINK THAT MIGHT
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO GETTING THROUGH BUD/S?

UM I DON’T KNOW I REALLY LIKE BEING ACTIVE I LIKE BEING ON MY FEET AND
DOING SOMETHING PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING THAT’S WHAT GIVES ME THE MOST
SATISFACTION AND DOING IT AND LIKE BEING A PART OF SOMETHING GREATER,
DOING IT AS PART OF A TEAM AND … DOING DRILLS OR WHATNOT AND DOING THEM
RIGHT. IT’S REALLY COOL TO BE A PART OF A COMMUNITY THAT IS CONSTANTLY
TRYING TO MAKE YOU BETTER. … I DON’T KNOW THERE’S NOT ANYTHING TO
COMPLAIN … ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET TO THIS POINT NOW (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

ANY MILITARY IN YOUR FAMILY THAT DIRECTED YOU TOWARDS NAVY?

UH I HAD TO UNCLES IN THE AIR FORCE AND MY GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE ARMY
BUT NOTHING REALLY LIKE MY PARENTS WEREN’T IN THE MILITARY … NOTHING
REALLY AROUND THIS REALM.

ANY FRIENDS THAT WERE GOING INTO THE MILITARY?

NO.

FROM WHAT POINT WERE YOU WHEN YOU DECIDED TO JOIN THE MILITARY?

LIKE I SAID WHEN I WAS 17 I DECIDED I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE ACTIVE. I WANTED TO DO IT THEN BUT THEN NEXT THING I WENT TO
COLLEGE AND THEN I MIGHT WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. I
ALWAYS KNEW I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ACTIVE IT WAS JUST WHETHER IT WAS
THE MILITARY OR WHAT. JANUARY 2018 WAS WHEN I ACTUALLY JOINED.

ANYTHING THAT WAS THE FINAL SWITCH?

LET’S SEE … AN INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY KIND OF FELL THROUGH SO I KNEW
THAT UH I KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO LAW
ENFORCEMENT THAT AND ITS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO RIGHT OUT OF
COLLEGE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE AND I’M LIKE ALRIGHT I’LL DO SOMETHING ELSE
COOL AND I’M LIKE ALRIGHT I’M GOING TO DO THIS AT LEAST FOR A NUMBER OF
YEARS

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD, PARENTS PARENTING STYLE, WERE YOU
DISCIPLINED AS A CHILD?

UM I WAS A KID THAT WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL EVERY SUNDAY. WE WERE … WERE
WERE PRETTY WELL BEHAVED KIDS WE DIDN’T DO ANYTHING REALLY STUPID. YEAH
WE HAD OUR FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW WENT ... I DON’T KNOW IT WAS A PRETTY
NORMAL UPPER MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBS LIFE. I CAN’T THINK OF A TIME THAT MY
PARENTS HAD TO REALLY LIKE COME DOWN HARD ON US … THEY DISCIPLINED US
WHENEVER WE DID SOMETHING BAD AS A KID BUT WE NEVER DID ANYTHING REALLY
STUPID.

AND WHAT WAS DISCIPLINE LIKE? TIMEOUTS, SPANKING, ETC.

YEAH WE GOT SPANKED BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT.

NOTHING THAT STANDS OUT?

NO NOT REALLY.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS, DID YOU PLAY SPORTS?

I PLAYED HOCKEY FOR TEN YEARS … BASEBALL FOR NINE … AND FOOTBALL FOR
THREE YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND I PLAYED VOLLEYBALL TOO WHEN I WAS IN
COLLEGE. TRACK TOO, BUT FOR FOOTBALL THE BOND WITH THE GUYS TOO WAS SO
MUCH MORE. I PLAYED TEN YEARS OF HOCKEY BUT IN THREE YEARS OF FOOTBALL I
FELT MUCH MORE OF A BOND WITH THE GUYS.

WAS THAT JUST THE DYNAMIC OF THE TEAM OR THE SPORT IN GENERAL?

I MEAN WE WERE A WINNING TEAM BUT I DON’T KNOW THE GUYS WERE JUST ALWAYS
… WE WOULD HAVE FUN AND … I DON’T KNOW I CAN’T REALLY DESCRIBE IT THE
GUYS WERE JUST REALLY GOOD. WE WERE A WINNING TEAM SO THAT HELPED
WINNING SO MUCH WE WERE ABLE TO JUST RELAX SOMETIMES.

HOW DO YOU THINK BEING A PART OF THOSE SPORTS CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
EXPERIENCE AS BUD/S?

KNOWING THAT GUYS WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING OR GUYS WORKING TOGETHER
TO ACHIEVE THE GREATER GOAL AND … JUST BEING AROUND LIKE MINDED
INDIVIDUALS.

IN THE FIVE YEARS LEADING UP TO BUD/S YOU WENT TO COLLEGE, STRAIGHT OUT
OF COLLEGE YOU DID BOOT CAMP. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WERE DOING?

I MEAN I WAS LIFTING, WORKING OUT, LIVING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. I
PARTICIPATED IN INTRAMURAL SPORTS UM I WAS IN A FRATERNITY IN COLLEGE …
THAT WAS KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT BROTHERHOOD ASPECT BUT NOT
NEARLY AS MUCH AS HERE. YEAH JUST WENT TO COLLEGE AND LIVED THE COLLEGE
LIFESTYLE AND HAD FUN BUT THAT’S KIND OF WHY I GRADUATED IN 3.5 YEARS
YOU KNOW I DID EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED TO AND THERE WASN’T MUCH LEFT
FOR ME.

WHAT ABOUT DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF IMPULSIVE AT ALL?

IMPULSIVE… UM … I WOULDN’T SAY SO.

ANY TATTOOS, SPEEDING TICKETS, PURCHASES WITHOUT REALLY THINKING ABOUT
IT?

NO NOT REALLY.

WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPONENT OF BUD/S WAS?

… I WOULD SAY FIRST PHASE DAILY GRIND.

AND WHY IS THAT?

IT’S NOT ONE EVOLUTION THAT GETS PEOPLE BUT UH … FIRST PHASE IT’S JUST
FIVE DAYS A WEEK YOU’RE GETTING DESTROYED AND UH GUYS THINK TOO FAR
AHEAD. LIKE I SAID IT’S NOT ONE EVOLUTION THAT GETS SOMEBODY ITS
THINKING TOO FAR AHEAD YOU KNOW THEY’RE NOT TAKING IT ONE STEP AT A
TIME.

WAS THAT YOUR METHOD OF GETTING THROUGH IT? JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME?

I HAD MY OWN MOTIVATION THAT I KNEW I NEEDED TO MAKE IT THROUGH BUD/S.

WHAT MOTIVATED YOU IN GENERAL TO GET THROUGH?

I … I JUST KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL I WAS GOING TO QUIT.

SO WHAT ABOUT GETTING ROLLED IN THIRD PHASE? WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GET
THROUGH AFTER THAT ROLL?

UM I TOOK A STEP BACK TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE UH THERE WERE GUYS
WHO HAD BEEN ROLLED WHO HAD BEEN TO HELL WEEK AND HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO
BO AND I’M HERE ALREADY IN THIRD PHASE SO IT KIND OF MAKES YOU
APPRECIATE YOU KNOW WHAT’S… IT’S JUST SEVEN WEEKS OF YOUR LIFE. IT’S NOT
THAT LONG IT’S NOT A BIG DEAL. WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO GET THROUGH WAS ITS
NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. YOU KNOW ITS STUPID THINGS BUT IT’S NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL. A THIRD PHASE ROLL IT’S NOT THAT BAD. THERE ARE MUCH WORSE
THINGS IF YOU GET ROLLED ALL THE WAY BACK.

SO IT’S JUST KEEPING THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE?

YEAH.

ANYTHING PHYSICAL, MENTAL, OR SPIRITUAL THAT YOU UTILIZED TO PUSH
THROUGH ANY CHALLENGES HERE AT BUD/S?

… UM … SPIRITUAL I WOULD SAY SO. THAT’S PART OF THE REASON WHY I’M HERE
AND WHY I DIDN’T GET HURT YOU KNOW THAT’S … SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY THAT
BUD/S IS JUST ABOUT GETTING LUCKY AND NOT GETTING HURT. I WOULDN’T SAY
IT’S LUCK I WOULD SAY … I WOULDN’T SAY I WAS MORE PROTECTED THAN OTHERS
BUT I THINK I HAD SOMEONE WATCHING OVER ME. THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT
I COULD HAVE VERY EASILY GOTTEN HURT ON BUT SOMEHOW SOMEWAY I DIDN’T.
PHYSICAL … YEAH I THINK WE ALL WORKOUT I THINK WE’RE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD
SHAPE BECAUSE YOU KNOW JUST TO GET INTO FIRST PHASE WE’RE FAR SURPASSING
NUMBERS FOR O-COURSE AND FOR RUNS. YOU KNOW FOR ME IT WAS UH THE SECOND
I THINK THE TIMES WERE GETTING TOUGH I THINK I MISSED THAT EVOLUTION UH
KNOWING THAT IT’S NOT GOING TO LAST THAT LONG I KNOW EVERYTHING IS
REGULATED … I KNOW THEY’RE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING STUPID TO WHERE …
AS IT WENT ON IT BECAME MORE RELAXED AND I THINK THAT CHANGED OUR
PERSPECTIVE ON THE WEEKS. TWO AND A HALF HARD WEEKS OF FIRST PHASE AND
THEN THINGS START TO TAPER OFF AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH HELL WEEK. THEN
AFTER THAT THINGS GET A LOT SMOOTHER SO IT WAS JUST PUTTING IT IN
PERSPECTIVE THAT I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE 2.5 WEEKS … SO IT WAS JUST
SEGMENTING. ESPECIALLY IN HELL WEEK I REALLY SEGMENTED THE DAYS.

SO YOUR SEGMENTS WERE BY DAY, HOUR, MINUTE?

I DID ALL THREE OF THEM. IF I WAS GETTING BEAT DOWN FOR A PERSONNEL
INSPECTION I WOULD DO IT BY MINUTES OR BY HOUR. SOMEHOW IF I COULD FIND
OUT WHAT THE TIME WAS AND WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY MORE MINUTES THAT’S NOT A
BIG DEAL JUST TWENTY MINUTES. UH WHEN I LAY MY HEAD DOWN AT NIGHT I KNEW
I ONLY HAD THIS MANY DAYS LEFT. SO LIKE I SAID I DIDN’T OVERSTRESS TIME
BUT I WOULD JUST TAKE IT MINUTE BY MINUTE AND HOUR BY HOUR.

WHAT ABOUT ANY TIME YOU HAD TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION, MORAL OR
ETHICAL, WHETHER YOU PERSONAL OR SEEING SOMEONE ELSE DO SOMETHING AND
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE?

… I CAN’T REALLY THINK OF ANYTHING… YEAH NOTHING COMES TO MIND.

ANYTIME SOMEONE WAS TAKING A SHORT CUT?

NO NOT REALLY.

WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING BUD/S?

… IT’S JUST … I CHOSE TO KEEP GOING … AND ALSO PUTTING OTHERS BEFORE
YOURSELF… AND AFTER HELL WEEK YOU START DOING THINGS THAT YOU SOMEWHAT
LIKE DOING … SO EVEN LIFESAVING AND GOING HEAD TO HEAD WITH AN
INSTRUCTOR UNDERWATER … I FOUND THAT FUN. YOU KNOW YOU'RE EITHER
AGGRESSIVE OR YOU START DOING THINGS THAT YOU LIKE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO MADE IT AND
SPECIFICALLY PEOPLE WHO QUIT?

… AT LEAST FROM THE GUYS THAT STARTED FIRST PHASE BECAUSE THERE’S SOME
GUYS WHO STARTED BO WHO JUST COULDN’T PASS A RUN OR … BUT STARTING FIRST
PHASE YOU SEE THE GUYS WHO CAN PHYSICALLY MAKE IT BUT THE GUYS WHO YOU
SEE THAT THERE’S JUST NOTHING THAT CAN MAKE THEM QUIT.

HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGE YOU AS A PERSON?

… UM HUMILITY. IT’S HARD AT TIMES.

ANYTHING ELSE THAT I DIDN’T ASK THAT I SHOULD HAVE?

NOT REALLY, ITS JUST MENTAL. EVERYBODY HERE IS PHYSICALLY CAPABLE BUT
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE HELMETS ON THE GRINDER IS THERE IS
NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

OK WELL WE’RE ALL DONE. CONGRATULATIONS.

Ok, so what’s your number?

93

And then, is it OK if I record?

Yes.

So, just tell me about how many siblings you have and like
what’s your birth order?

I have three siblings. I’m the oldest of them all. Uh, I have two
younger sisters and a younger brother.

And then, think about your life experiences, and what do
you, what would you describe as a crucible event, or something that
really shaped your life?

Probably uhh, my parents being divorced, uh kinda led to uh I had
to uh I that uh live with my mom and I wasn’t too fond of that idea
because I was really close to my dad, and I eventually got the age where
I was able to choose which house I wanted to go to and I went to my dads
and it was really good for me because my dads side of the family is
really just uhm, really close and really family oriented, and all their
values and morals just like got uh passed on to me and I was just uh
really grateful for them. My grandparents were very supportive and
involved in my life, along with my sister. It was really good, you know.

So, how do you think those experiences factored into your
experience at BUD/S?

Just coming from a, coming from a good background, I guess uhm I
grew up in church and I would always fall back on God when things got
really uh difficult, and uhm just like being raised up that household
and my grandmother is a prayer warrior. She is like my number one
supporter and anything I ever did she would just like, supported me no
matter what it was and I just didn’t want to let anyone down. So I think
that kinda like was a driving force behind me.

So tell me about how you think your personality helped you
through BUD/S. Is there anything about your personality that you think
made you successful?

I don’t know, maybe being, being quiet and reserved. If I had to
pick anything, uhm I’m kinda quiet. It takes me a while to warm up to
some people. But when I do, its uhm, I open up a lot and get really
close with some of the guys in, but the first, going through first phase
and basic orientation, I was just knda to myself alot, and kinda watched
things happen, uhm I just kinda like formed my opinion and took things
as they came at me.

So what motivated you to push through? Like did you feel
supported by the group? Even though you weren’t close? Or what?

Somewhat, yeah . Whenever we’d do you know just really hard
evolutions, the boat crew would just come together and uhm you know
drive one another and motivate each other. Something that’s a really
cool aspect about it, is guys you barely know, you get put through this
crucible, and it somehow brings you closer, because you all are all uh
experiencing and feeling the same kind of effects and pain. Uhm there’s
just kinda no way around it.

Uhm, what would you say, what practices, helped you get
through, push through, like spiritual, mental, physical? What did you
do? Did you have anything specific that you did when it was a really
hard time?

I would say a little prayer in my head, uhm, that think that,
looking back on it, and in the moment, it really helped me. As far as
mental things go, I just tried to take, take things as they came and
like, you know one evolution at a time, and I didnt think too far ahead,
I just kinda went with the flow of things and I tried not to overthink a
lot of it and that really helped keep a level head.

And then, can you think of a time when you had a difficult
decision to make during training and what went through your mind during
that decision?

A difficult decision? Uhm.

And if you can’t think of anything that’s fine. Not
everybody has decisions they have to make.

Uhm, nothing really comes to mind.

Why do you think that you were successful in completing
BUD/s? There’s a lot of people that started with your class, and you're
making it here, you made it, you got your trident, you know what made
you successful?

Uhm, I don’t know I guess just like living it day by day and just
like I was saying earlier, not, not thinking too far ahead, not
overthinking things, just tried to remain calm whenever things were
chaotic, and I just knew that there was a lot of talk and I knew it
wasn’t always gonna suck, for lack of a better word.

Ok so let me ask you this, did you notice anything
different about the people that didn’t make it? Like what made someone
quit and you were able to stick it out?

Not believing in themselves. If I had to give anybody any advice,
who quit and wanted to come back or somebody who wanted to try the
program out, I’d say just to believe in themselves because there was a
lot of times where I doubted myself, even prior to coming, I was really
nervous about it, and it gave me butterflies I just couldn’t get rid of,
but it just all came back to believing in yourself and believing in what
you're doing and just believing that this is what I truly wanted to come
here and do. And, I think that helped me and the guys that had doubts.

Ok what about, what, what, part of your background led you
to even being a SEAL in the first place?

Like made me want to do this?

Yeah what made you want to do it?

Uhm, like I was a little kid, and I had this game system, the
Playstation One, and there was this game called the SOCOM US Navy SEALs.
It kinda planted this seed. I always grew up uhh living like the
outdoors lifestyle, hunting, fishing, and shooting guns. The idea of
being in the military appealed to me, and even more so like being in
special ops and stuff. Uhh and as I got older, I got more interested in
it and did my research and always came back to the navy and the navy
seals. Yeah i just really liked the idea of it being considered one of
the hardest things to do.

What about your childhood like when you did something wrong
at home, how did your parents discipline you? And it might have been
different for your mom and your dad if you lived in two different
houses. How did that work? Like if you did something wrong, what did
your mom do? What did your dad do?

Typically get a whooping.

Ok.

My mom didn’t really like to do that all too much. I mean neither
of my parents you know enjoyed discipling a child in that way you know
but when it came to it and I needed it.

A lot of people do that, so what about when you were a
teenager, like anything big like did you move around, did you play any
sports? Like what kinda formed you?

I grew up playing baseball for a lot of my youth and I moved around
a few times when I lived with my mom and once I finally got the choice
of moving in with my dad I kinda grounded in one spot and stayed in the
same school for the entirety of my uhh time as a student going through
high school and middle school and I ran a couple years of cross country
and uh cross country and track in high school.

Tell me about those team oriented things. What did you
think about that? Did you feel like it was a tight community? Was it
everyone for themselves?

It was uhh, our team was very tight. An uh, it was just because our
coach was just like absolutely phenomenal. He devoted so much time and
effort and multiple hours before work and after work just to our team
and making sure everything was taken care of and uh he made sure that
there was no animosity between different players, or uh teammates on the
team.

And then, how bout, so what was your life like in the past
five years before you came to BUD/S? Did you go to high school then go
straight to boot camp? Like what was your sequence?

Umm I went to high school. Graduated in 2018. I spent those four
years kinda figuring out what I wanted to do with my life and I was
kinda bouncing back and forth between going to school and doing a trade
and coming to the military and finally boiled it down to joining the
Navy. Now, that’s part of the reason why I joined uh cross country, was
to get in shape, get in good shape, and it’s led to even greater things.
I got really close and tight with the boys on the team and I still keep
in touch with a lot of them. My best friend, uh was on the, was on the
team and he continued on with his career running into college and uhh
yeah that was.

So, did you join the Navy specifically to be a SEAL?

Yes ma’am.

So did you go straight from boot camp, do they call it that
in the navy? Boot camp?

Yes ma’am.

Ok, so did you go straight from boot camp to come here?

I did. So I went straight to boot camp, and after two months of
that, I went to BUD/S prep which is like uhh, a preparatory school for,
for BUD/S, uhm swimming, running, and lifting. Stuff like that. And then
I came straight here. So it was like a pretty straight forward process.

So what motivates you on a daily basis?

Uhm just being a part of this community, and my family.

Think about your hardest day at BUD/S. What was the most
challenging part? And then, uhm what was that? And then, uh what
motivated you to keep going?

There’s been a lot of lows. Uhm I don’t think I have one specific
day in mind, but there’s a few moments during hellweek that were like
really, really hard to like uhh push past that mental barrier of just
like realizing that I had a few more days left of this kind of treatment
and uhm, like I said before, it’s just like saying a little prayer in my
head and just knowing that it will be over eventually just really helped
me during those hard times. Even throughout BUD/S, not just hellweek
specifically.

Uhm, how did the whole experience of BUD/S change you as a
person?

Thats a good question, uhm.

Or did it?

It did. It did. Uhm, to be more confident in myself and to believe
I’m, I’m capable of what I think I’m not capable of, and.

Ok.

I try to yeah, that’s a hard question.

It is.

I’d have to sit on that for a little bit to uh.

Ok well I got one more for you. What, so we’re asking this
on behalf of SOCOM, to help the next group. What should I have asked you
that would have given me, that I didn’t ask you, that might help me give
more insight to people who want to come to BUD/S. Anything you can think
of?

The question of like why, “what made you want to do this?”

Mhmm.

Because, I think you need a really, you need a really good reason
to come here and take on this training. It can’t just be because you
know, cause it’s cool, or cause uh, I don’t know. You have to have
something to always fall back on. Because, when things get really hard
and you don’t have like a solid reason of why you want to do this, it’d
just be as easy as, just as easy as that to just quit.

Alright and I'm with number 97.

That was my first note card and then I was given this.

Ok so 97 and 355

Yes sir

Time is 0943, 10 Feb, this is Commander Ledford and I'm gonna to go
through this. And you're good with us recording…?

Absolutely

Ok

Yup

So I wanna go through some softball questions to get started with.

Sure

Umm What buds class did you start with?

Uhhh 338

You started with 338. And was that your first-

it was

buds experience?

Yes

Ok

How many uhh siblings do you have?

I have two older brothers.

Two older brothers so uhh. What. your age is?

I'm 26 year old. They're both like 32 and 30

So one bro is 32 or 30 and another brother is 32

Yes sir

Ok. and then parents, married, separate, divorced?

Yup they're together

Always been together?

Yes. They're both in their mid 60s

And how is your relationship with them?

Uhh, its, it's solid. Uhh With my dad i'm extremely close he's one of
my best friends and mentors. And with my mom I think by me coming to
haha NSW it's been hard for her but we're working on it. Trying to get
closer, but my dad and I are very similar so. Very strong
relationship.

Mom is just kind of worried about you?

I think yeah i think she she had worked hard uhh for our family kinda
being the breadwinner wanted me to probably use more of my education
toward the corporate direction. That was not what I wanted. And uhh
she's come around toward what we're doing but it took a while. And uh
yeah that's kinda where we stand right now. Just trying to piece
together back some like.. Some just some good rapport .

What does she do?

Uhh She was a CFO for a construction company and she just retired this
year so she's newly retired

What about your dad?

My dad’s an insurance agent.

*clicks tongue* What about, looking at your life events that
    happened prior to coming to buds like what were the things that
    really shaped you?

Uhh so being apart of sports teams was a massive part of my identity
and also just uh learning about uh human potential and So I played uh
soccer hockey and lacrosse in high school and uhh I ended up playing
division 1 lacrosse at UNC chapel hill and uh we won a national
championship there and uh myself and ensign mathi who is in um 338
kind of had a big part in why we kind of changed the culture there and
turned things around. And so that had a big uh a big part in me
wanting to do this. Was just being on a really good team and being
devoted to something. And so that commemorate piece was definitely
what shaped me the most. I would say being aware of other people's
backgrounds from working and from playing hockey in Buffalo which is
where I'm from. Had a whole lot of friends who didn't have a lot of
opportunities. Uh who relied on sports teams to benefit their families
and so that was extremely helpful. Just being cognisant of what's
what. Um and just I think that's kind of helped me here being able to
relate to guys that maybe have um been looked down upon or maybe felt
like they never had a chance to get out. But um yeah those experiences
were huge for me. Building confidence and learning how to communicate
so uh yeah

And that that covers the next question about how do uh these
    experiences factor into your experience at buds. Uh what's your
    personality? What do you think about your personality that
    contributed to your progression through here?

I think uhh empathy is probably the biggest thing um understanding how
to relate to other people over the same things. Make sure that guys
feel valued um so i think that comes from my father. Uh my father’s
he's a great hockey coach, youth hockey coach. Played college hockey
and williams college and all his brothers played college hockey, had a
lot of cousins play hockey and um I think having um a little bit of
you know awareness for guys that are going through a hard time and
making sure you help lift them is probably my most redeeming quality
as an officer and definitely makes me I think stand out um and I guess
my personality I like to (*unintelligible 45-48) … you know um
really cognizant of details and trying to get the job done so those
are probably the two things as an officer.

What about your background um that lead you to become apart of the
community, did you have any seal friends or family-

So there was

-in the military?

There was a DEVGRU seal who I coached his son in lacrosse, uhh his son
kinda shared some words on uhh how I’d been coaching and how I had
been interacting with guys on the team so his dad came up to me one
time and said hey I don't know if you have a direction about where you
want to go after college but I think you might want to take a look at
this. Uhh that was in 2014 and uh ever since then uh I just had the
seed had been planted and I was just obsessed with it so uh I just
started to look into the military specifically the seal pipeline and
uh my grandfather also fought in world war 2, he was a lieutenant
commander uh on a navy sub chaser and uh his leadership for our family
was inspiring to me and then just kinda growing up from like having
some things, I wanted to give back so that was... I thought the
military is the best way to do it. I thought about firefighting for a
long time but I like the military more.

About your childhood, how were you disciplined as a child? Like were
your parents very strict, did they spank you, they put you in time
out, pull your toys?

There was there was definitely uh like spanking when was I was younger
uhh but up until like around 5 or 6 and then after that it became more
of about trust kind of uh agreement, you know like do you do things
the right way, you're respectful and you're a good guy were going to
give you more leeway to experience things and I think from having two
older brothers kind of also brought about a pretty different place. I
was able to see things early on which I think a lot of people weren't
in terms of just like how the inner city works and how being close to
friends whose dads are in jail or dads are... have kids with 5
different women and you're playing on sports teams with these guys and
these guys don't know where they're gonna get their next meals so uh
thats was uh that was huge so in terms of discipline and just it was
about trust between my parents and I but uh and when I violated that
they definitely like grounded me and locked me down make me focus on
school or they would limit my exposure to sports when I was acting
poorly so I think by the time id gotten to be like 12 i had just
curbed that attitude I had... (Unintelligible 48-51)... kind of
curbed that and uh I became more of a disciplined guy so.

Alright uh did you guys move around a lot or?

Uhh no just within buffalo. My mom started to have more success in her
job so we had a little bit more financial flexibility but early on it
was kinda tight and so um we just stayed in buffalo just in a better
house so ya

And then team sports you talked about working on team sports?

Yes

Lacrosse?

So uh soccer hockey lacrosse and uh I had an option to play all three
in college but uh I chose lacrosse

So through the last 5 years prior to coming to BUDS what did you do
before coming here?

So I graduated from college in 2017 uh

UNC right?

Yes those summers in college I worked construction uh mostly under the
table uh for friends and family back home and then after college I had
a series of odd jobs. I was a salesman for a metals and chemicals
company in Buffalo, I was a hockey and lacrosse coach and then I also
did administrative work for my mom's construction firm as well on the
weekends so I was trying to save as much money as I could so I could
train and then like have the luxury of like working independently and
train with a performance coach to try and get me ready for SOAS. I
came to SOAS and then I got a BUDS contract so…

How long were you training?

Umm from august of 2017 until july of 2018 that was my soas class was
that july and then I got picked up for OCS I went to OCS in november
of 2018. So it was about a 16 month process for me. From starting
training to eventually going to OCS. And I thought really about
enlisting too but uhh I wanted to go to SOAS so.

So basically graduate August 2017 from UNC, you were on sales, you
were coaching hockey for about 16 months while you were training?

Yeah

And then you go to OCS

I had an internship uh at a at a insurance company as well towards the
end um I had to navigate something with my boss who I was selling
metals and chemicals for. I just wanted something to do and I knew I
was going to get picked up so I just wanted to get some more
experience so I had an internship for three months and that was a
great experience.

Would you consider yourself an impulsive person?

Im-Im-Impulsive?

Impulsive yes

I, I definitely think so yeah. I think um calculated more often than
not but if I want to do something or if I see something as a good
opportunity I take it, but uhm I, I initially transferred schools so I
started out at Denison University in Ohio and I was kinda like a late
bloomer for lacrosse and I had had a lot of success my freshman year
uhm and that fall I knew I could play at a higher level so I decided
to transfer to UNC and I kinda left, I mean I could’ve had a really
really solid career at Denison and like probably won a national
championship there as well but I would have been the guy and I decided
that UNC was kind of was like a grinder you know. Apart of the club, I
wasn't the talented guy. I was the guy who kinda had to earn
everything and uhm that was probably the more impulsive decision I
made. I was like “I want something more” but uhm I think that most
people probably wouldn't have done that so I got a lot of ridicule for
that but uhm impulsive I guess like things I could also think of
honestly would be I got to travel after I graduate college. I made a
decision to take a 3 week trip all throughout europe and I had a
series of friends that were overseas so I planned this trip using the
money I saved throughout college and I went from country to country
and just didn't take like, ya know I didn't like take like a long time
to plan this trip I was just like “I needed to go experience something
new before I started my training for the teams.” Yeah that was a great
trip.I mean uh I guess uh impulsives i guess just like climbing or
just doing hiking or jumping as a kid I never really had any fear.
When I was ten years old I would go and do this 50 foot jumps with my
dad and he was like “Holy shit man what are you doing?” but he always
wanted me to experience those things for myself and challenge myself
so.

What about tattoos? Do you have any tattoos?

I do I have one that's for our team, a national championship tattoo.
Each guy had something a little bit different but I think about 30
guys on our team got something to honor that.

Yeah

And then I have one on my hip that's very small it's just a Led
Zeppelin lyric so… but not really seeking to get more. I just kinda
wanted to get something at the time.

Awesome. What about, what do you think is the most challenging part
    of BUD/S like uh think about your hardest day or event or...

So I got rolled in 2nd phase for OC5, buddy gear exchange. I had had
pneumonia from hell week and uh I think I didn't want to take the roll
before 2nd phase because I was in that class and it was a very special
class and uh I didnt… I didnt want to not graduate with my best buds
and uh so I tried to push the envelope and I was severely i think
diminished and in a way I wasn't ready to go and mentally I wasn't as
locked on as I had been throughout all of 1st phase I was just so
kinda uh focused on the fact that I was still trying to recover from
Hell Week. Uh I just performed really poorly and I uh I got Recdrop.
Recognized drop from the program. First thing I had ever failed as
BUD/S, had kinda been known as a top performer and uh had done really
well up until that point and I felt like my world was kinda turning
upside down because I got Rec dropped. I was like “ahhh”

Because of your performance for OC5?

Yeah and uh it it definitely forced me to look inward and just stay
focused on the fact that ya know you probably will get another shot as
long as you just ya know be patient and keep working. So I just
trained like crazy and dove like crazy and tried to get my lungs ready
to go for OC5 by just doing a lot of breath work and um getting my
endurance back up and um the second time came around and I crushed it
and I was happy with that result because I think I had spent so much
time focusing on “hey this is your option, you either improve on that
weakness or not and say no I need to feel sorry for myself” and uh
that was a big confidence booster after the fact but that was my
hardest time at BUDS for sure.

Yup

I had about 4 weeks of being Rec. dropped with no word about when my
board was gonna be.

So what got you through that, that time? Those 4 weeks?

Um I had a couple seal mentors that were extremely helpful to me. one
of them being that DEVGRU seal that initially mentored me uh.

You talk to him through that period?

I did. Another one who uh actually lived in Chapel Hill so I knew him
from out in college, uh and Commander (Unintelligible name time
04). He interviewed me for SOAS um and we had developed a nice
rapport during soas and he was there for me just giving me advice,
that just to stay focused don't let it deter you from your dreams and
you goals. And I just trained like a madman I got in unbelievable
shape so I got ready to go

Were there any daily practices like physical mental spiritual
    something that you did on a consistent basis that also helped with
    the challenges?

Uh I read a little about stoicism, about Mark Aurelius and uh I would,
I had done it throughout college and as well as in 1st phase but not
with the same consistency, I had a journal. I wrote a lot I wrote
about my goals each day and I also wrote out my long term goals and I
uh I just thought about kinda like envisioned in my head what ringing
that bell at the pool would feel after pool comp. and that was like my
driving factor. I would like use that image to propel you so I just
thought about that image for a while. Same thing when I was going
through hell week. Seeing that american flag at the top of the berm
that was what got me through Hell Week like “I'm gonna see that” so.

Is there a difficult decision maybe that you could uh that you
    experienced or you really really struggled with?

Yes uh I, I am grateful I made the choice that I did but I feel bad
about the consequences it had which there was a guy in our class 338
in 1st phase. He had kinda gotten through Hell Week in my idea he
snuck through. A lot of guys felt that way as well and he- this guy
definitely had discipline issues like authority issues and uh he
missed curfew and he also lied about having a car and had stuff in his
car which is why he lied and we had this inspection during one of our
PIAI akk the instructors were asking who had cars on base uh we need
to check your vehicles it's a mandated thing and uh I noticed he
didn't roger up and I also noticed he didn't (unintelligible
36-37) I thought he could have gotten us in trouble because I
thought they were keeping tabs on us and our OIC at the time had
gotten word through the grapevine through other people that yeah this
guy has a car because I had visually seen him drive off base that day
that we had to do the inspection. I was kind of like (unintelligible
56-58). I didn't really want to be put in that position uh I
didn't think it was my place but I also didn't want the class to be
reprimanded for someone who was selfish so I had to be the guy that
confirmed that I saw this and then he ended up getting dropped from
the class and dropped from training but he had, he also had other
things that contributed to that decision and they wouldn't have
dropped him if he had a clean slate or something like that. It
definitely, it definitely like stayed with me for a bit because I was
like damn it that's not the kinda guy I want to be known as. As like
some guy that throws people under the bus but on the same token this
guys totally looking out for himself, not the class and our cadre
specifically said if you guys are out of line we will hammer you and
so I just uh I wanted to do the right thing by rogering up when
somethings asked but I felt pretty bad about that because I just
squashed some guys dreams. However if that guy got into a command on
deployments and stuff -

Exactly

-is that the honorable guy you want to be in the command? So that's
what kinda what kept me in check so.

Why do you think you were successful going through BUDS?

I think the empathy piece, being able to relate to people, and pull up
others according to their needs when they needed it. I think that's
what made me stand out as an officer and also just as a person. A lot
of people have made those comments throughout the past couple days
since we graduated they’re like “that's what we’re gonna remember
you.” You know all the enlisted guys will go to SQT and we will go to
JOTC and uh that definitely, I appreciate that um that stands out
(unintelligible 52-55)

What uh about the ones who didn't make it? What was different about
them?

Uh I would say their overall commitment to the bigger picture not
necessarily just the pain of being in BUDS but do you want to look at
your buddy with honor and pride for overcoming adversity and
sacrificing for the men beside you. I think that's something people
probably lose sight of. You're so caught in their individual pain and
suffering, not even suffering, pain and it overcomes them and uh I saw
some really really good officers and enlisted guys not make it through
339’s Hell Week. I was working that Hell Week, and I couldn't believe
it. I was like these guys ya know if they just took a deep breath and
thought about it for 30 more minutes they probably wouldn't quit. And
uh yeah that was tough there was a lot of guys that (unintelligible
59-02) solid individuals who could've been really solid SEALS um
had all the characteristics that you'd want. Um I think it's just
making that conscious decision.

How do you feel this experience has changed you?

Definitely made me more patient um gave me some humility. I think
that's the piece I can continue to work on that's just always someone
better than you smarter than you faster than you so just continue to
be a good listener and try to retain information um and um try to pass
it forward. If someone reaches out to me who wants to go to BUD/S I
gonna do everything I to help them because I never really had a lot of
that list of individuals I mentioned um people kinda chilled and think
you're crazy you think you make it through BUD/S? Even my parents. My
mom (unintelligible 05-08)... made me feel insignificant for
wanting to try and do this so.

Is there anything else you think I should have asked about what got
you through or helped you or hurt you.

Umm maybe about funny experiences because I think humor and I think um
lightheartedness is an extremely helpful um aspect of this training.
You meet some of the funniest guys ever throughout BUD/S and I think
that actually does play into getting through some difficult evolutions
and times um specifically Hell Week. Some of the jokes that are going
on or watching some guys uh do instructor impressions and stuff like I
think it's extremely valuable and I know a lot of people agree. I
would say the fact that being able to laugh at BUD/S is the reason why
people can keep pushing forward. Umm anything else? Um maybe asking
guys what they're reading. I think reading is extremely valuable
especially in San Clemente Island when the guys would have downtime
and we were always reading and sharing each other's books.

What are you reading right now

Uh Im reading Man’s Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl.

What made you pick up that book?

Uh So my friend got it and I heard about it from my brother as well.
It’s just about how looking at the bigger picture of ya know suffering
and torment and how it helps shape men uh I also reading Band of
Brothers so uh between those two. It's more about the platoon
experience from war... (unintelligible 10) … just his experience. I
just uh I’ll reread sections over and over again just to understand
what that story is like in those places. I really like historical,
historical like works and nonfiction. Try to keep those on my list.

Alright thank you that was awesome that was really really good yeah I
really appreciate all your uh comments it was great.

Sure.

Alright see you.

 Yeah the recorder is on, is it okay if I record the interview?

 Yes

 Ok, this is participant 98. I’m going to put this really close to you
so I can hear you, I know my questions. So easy questions first, how
many siblings do you have?

 Two

 Okay and what is the birth order?

 What’s the?

 What kind of birth order, where do you fall?

 Uh, I’m the middle child

 And then, whats kinda the gender breakdown of your siblings?

 They’re both females.

 Okay…. Thinking about your life experiences, what might you describe
as your crucible or kind of life shaping experiences?

 Probably the school that I went to for 13 years, basically
Kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade and the experience of going
there and sustaining that education was extremely beneficial for me.
Seeing the same teachers as I got older and being unable to connect back
with them, um when I think about some of the most influential people in
my life, its, its from (cannot discern) school. I’d say that's a big
one.

 I’m gonna put this really close up, I’m just afraid its not going to
catch..

Sure

 With the background noise

 Right, uh I’ll lean in, Um.. I also believe that I went North
Carolina and played lacrosse there and so...playing lacrosse at North
Carolina was an extremely formative experience for me and the successes
and failures there absolutely were essential, So I'd say that's another
crucible. And… I did some traveling after college before I got into the
military and so one of those things I did was sailing across the
Atlantic, Cape Town to the Carribean. And that right there was the time
of some of the best reflection I’ve ever had.

 Yeah

 Internal reflection, but I also spent some time, you know just a few
select people and getting to know them on a really really deep level.
Going through uh, interesting, uh you know in some cases hardships but
more just about this physical experience was really unique.

 Was that something, I mean how did, what motivated you to do that?
Were you a sailor? Whats…

 I wasn’t a big sailor, it was more just the interest in getting
adventure. Um, and it had always been on my mind if I ever had the
opportunity to do a crossing, I wanted to do one, So…

 And then, did you know the people before you did that?

 I did not, no.

 How many people were there?

There were…. 6 of us on the way over to Brazil and then there was just
2 of us on the way to the Carribean.

 Um, how did those experiences, like any of them.. There was this
sailing experience or you said you had some failures, sports, how did
that kind of shape your experience here at Buds or help you?

 I’d say it just helped me to be resilient. Um, when I think about
playing lacrosse at Carolina, having small, maybe call them micro
failures in a game, practice. Learning how to have a one track mind,
just hit the reset button and kinda have that hammered into your brain
of uh, if you uh dwell on the failure you just had, that’s gonna
compound and could result in having a really bad day, week, month and
that's when players tend to go through really bad slumps and you know
potentially quit the game altogether. So, I think learning how to um,
learn from mistakes, particularly at Carolina was a big one. Um, I’d say
that there's one other place that comes to mind just because it
developed a growth mindset for me, placed called Camp Pasquanni. I went
there as a camper, I worked there as a counselor for 3 years and
something that we instilled everyday and practiced everyday as
counselors with the boys is how can we help this boy, that boy
understand what it means to have a growth mindset. How can we implement
that with them um, because I think that is one of the most important
things a young growing person can have is that lack of a fixed mindset
and the ability to recognize that failure is a good thing and a lot of
what you’re doing is just growth, experiential.

 Is that where you were kind of introduced to the idea of growth
mindset?

 Absolutely, yeah

 And what age were you when you were at this camp?

 I was 12 years old as a camper and then as a counselor, I was there
for 3 years so that was when I was 22, 23, and 24… I believe.

 Um, how would you describe your personality and how do you think your
personality contributed to progressing through Bud’s?

 I um, I think I’m a type A individual, like a lot of the guys here.
But I think I usually fall on the more soft spoken side. Um and there
are parts of my personality that are introverted in the sense that I
like to read or even like paint, stuff like that. Do things that are um,
very introverted, I guess introverted activities. And then there are
other parts of me that are extremely extroverted and like to be in that
realm so its more of a balance set of character traits. Something that I
strive to be is somewhat of a Renaissance man.

 A what?

 A Renaissance, that's what I strive to be.

 So a minute ago, more specifically into your childhood, what in your
background led you to becoming a Seal?

 So what led me to want to become a Navy Seal?

 Yeah

 Being on sports teams and experiencing what its like to, to go
through challenges with a group of people is a big one. Recognizing how
beneficial that is for me personally, to share in hardship and
experience success, group success with guys I think is something that is
addicting and …. Some of the greatest moments of my life have been
shared experiences with a group towards a goal, and achieving a goal. So
it made a lot of sense to me, to go to the best possible tea I could
think of joining.

 At what point did you know that you wanted to become a Seal?

 Two and a half years ago.

 Okay, and that was post college?

 Post college

 So tell me, I’m gonna ask more about that in just a minute, but tell
me a little bit about your early childhood?

 I grew up in a, so a, two parents who are still together today and
with my sisters were all close in age, so I;d say it was a very healthy
childhood in that sense.

 What was your parents parenting style?

 Loving and they, a lot of it was built on trust. And so they were not
the aggressive, in their, in the way they reprimanded us but they would
more or less communicate that the trust was lost when we did something
as kids that wasn't good and that, our relationship was strong enough
that that was the worst possible, kind if like penalty that we could
receive. So losing that trust and I think that that was something that
was really formative for us as kids. Before we knew how to deal with
people and manage people. Um, there was not a lot of shouting and uh, I
think that that level of calm in dealing with the conflicts that we
created as kids has rubbed off on us in a good way.

 What about discipline in your house? Were you spanked at all, put in
time outs, had toys taken away or was it all just…?

 I’d say there was very little timeout type stuff, although there was
some of that. And the physical piece was not really a thing, uh my
parents were not aggressive and the penalties usually involved stuff
being taken away, more restriction.

 Um, what about your teenage years, you talk about playing sports but
did you move around at all during your teenage years or even earlier in
your childhood?

 Stayed in the same place that I grew up in the whole time, uh so I
was focused a lot on the sports.

 And you played a lacrosse…?

 I played lacrosse, and a bunch of others like, liked to do a lot of
different things and I’d say.. I wasn’t into theatre, Um, I did in the
teenage years start to get into art so that was a big thing for me.

 Was there an art group or was that just on your own?

 There was a teacher in the 7th grade who kinda said, hey kind of have
an eye for this, would you like to do more of this outside of school and
I started to do that, you know outside of the sports practices. I’d go
there and do work for maybe an hour or two, painting and drawing and
thats where it started and I continued on through high school and
college and its still part of my life today but not to the same
capacity.

 What about the last five years of your life, what have they been
like? Kind of leading up to the Seals?

 So part of that includes college and a lot of that was dedicated to
lacrosse, the social life at Carolina, my academics, all of that stuff
was avery enjoyable time. Uh lived very carefee, did not have any fixed
ambitions of joining the military, just kind of dreamed fantasies, long
distanced thoughts. Then , got out of Carolina, did some traveling as I
mentioned and all of that was designed to get out into the world in
order to figure out what I wanted to do back in the States perhaps. I
really wasnt boxing myself in, I just wanted to get out and feel the
freedom of traveling. So thats, a lot of it was unknown, a lot of
unknowns, and in that time there was lot of relflection, writin and
reading that you know enabled me to figure out that this was the place,
you know, this pipeline was the one I wanted to go through and
ultinately becoming a Naval Officer is what I was gonna do.

 What about impulses? Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?

 Yes

 So you talked about some kind of impulsive behaviors in your life…

 I would say that if somebody that I trust was like hey, we’re gonna
go play volleyball and threw a volleyball at me, I’d probably sto what I
was doing an play volleyball.

 Any negative impulsive behavior? I don't know maybe a tattoo on a
whim or…

 No, I haven't had a tattoo on a whim and no I don’t think there are
any that come to mind that are like bad impulsive behavior that have had
like repercussions, that I look back on and really regret. I don’t have
a lot of regrets in life, that I can really find.

 And any tattoos, I know its seems like.

 I have a tattoo yeah

 But its something that is profound and..

Yeah, its a sibling tattoo. I’ve had it for I think 4 years now and we
probably talked about it for 5, 6 years prior to getting it, so.

Um, any sort of driving violations like speeding tickets, anything
like that?

 There’s nothing on my record, no

 [Not discernable] I know it seems like an odd question

 No, thats ok, I’m not judging at all

 What motivates you on a daily basis?

 Working with the guys that I’ve been going through this pipeline
with, is probably the most motivating aspect. Because when you’re
driving to work, yeah some days its great but ragged to the bone kind of
in your own head, thinking about it. The boat you can kind of get into
it, can work with the guys, you get lost in the experience of it and
that is what makes you come back and I think is what is the most
enjoyable piece of the puzzle.

 What if you think about the most challenging piece of Buds, whether
it be a big thing or jsut a signle day, what might that be?

 The most challenging thing?

 Yeah

 Its the day in and the day out and I’ve heard a lot of guys talk
about that, I ould agree with it. Its the wear and tear on your body.
That you know then creates a mental fatigue and so I think that it
ultimately comes down to the mental fatigue, stress that comes with this
pipeline. I’ve certainly felt it and I think everyone feels it one way
or another.

 So what do you think motivated you to push through that mental
fatigue?

 The experiences from the past, I think that I’ve been through have
helped me cope with that stuff but ultimately its having a very clear
goal and ends, goal in sight that you can hold onto when things are
going really crummy. And that manifests itself in different ways, one of
the personal goals is just not to let my friends down, the people that
I’m working with down. I owe it to them to keep going. For my family and
so thats a small thing, there are a bunch of those in my mind but thats
just one of the factors that I could draw stregnth from, like ok if I
quit now, I’m gonna be dissapointing quite a few people. Myself yes, but
a lot of people whpo have put a lot of time and effort investing in me
and I owe it to myself and to them to continue on.

 Any specific practices, whether it be mental, physical, spiritual
that you would utilize as you progressed through Buds?

 Uh….. I practiced a little bit of meditation, from time to time.

 Anything else you would use?

 Music, yeah music. I don’t know if that counts but I found that to
ber quite often, that I’m going back to if I have free time. Could
involve music probably.

 Is it something you like listening to with ear buds or out loud?

 Probably out loud. Um, sharing that experience with people but ear
buds If I’m in a public place that is not [not discernable]

 What about a difficult decision you had to make during training at
Buds. What went through your mind as you made that decision?

 One of the difficult decisions I had tio make was one back, First
Phase, the guy who, um I was our ROC at the time and I had to make a
decision as to whether or not this person deserved to, what he had done,
to be exposed and brought to light to the cadre because of the severity
of the issue. Fortunately, I had other guys helping me to make the
decision and I was helping them to make the decision. But I look back on
that as very stressful and um, I think I’ll draw on that experience in
the future.

 So you don’t have to tell me all the details but was that an ethical
type of decision?

 Yes, it was ethical

 About something that person had done?

 Yes

 Why do you think you were successfull at Buds?

 Mindset

 Wat about your mindset helped you to be successful?

 A clear vision of where I’m going and wo I’m going there with

 And when you refer to who you are going their with?

 These other guys in my class

 Did you notice anything different about the guys that made it through
Buds reative to the rest of the group and if so what was different?

 I can’t say for everyone but recognizing a ike minded individual in
each guy that has made it this far.

 Would you say you are a calm person?

 Yes

 Have you always been that way?

 No

 When did you switch from being less calm?

 I think it was perhaps going through puberty and stuff like that. I
think I was a little bit more outgoing, uh outspoken probably the better
way to put it. Now I just maybe do a little less talking and a little
more listening. I could definitely be a better listener. But yeah I
think I’m not quite as extroverted as I was in say highschool, middle
school, perhaps sometime in college I started making that transition.
After maybe getting counseled and talking to people and learnig and sort
of observing the world and realized that perhaps it was better to do a
little more listening.

 Um, thats it, well done. Congratulations!

 Thank you so much, appreciate it.

 It was good to meet you

 Likewise, thanks for your time

OK, so again, you’re OK if I record this?

Yes.

This is participant 99. Now I’m done with all the official
things. I’m gonna put this really close to this so I can catch you.

No worries.

I have a couple of really easy questions first. Tell me the
number of siblings you have?

2 siblings.

2 siblings. And where do you fall in the birth order?

I am the youngest.

Youngest, OK. And then what is the gender of the..?

My oldest is my sister, and the middle is my brother.

OK. Uhm, if you think of your life experiences, what might
you describe as a crucible, or life shaping experience?

Just BUD/S.

Really? Nothing going into it?

No, nothing nearly as difficult.

What uh, anything like, I’ll get into more, I’m getting
ahead of myself. What, uh, what made you want to do BUD/S?

Uh, I grew up in a military family.

What branch?

My father was a fighter pilot in the Air Force. All the way back
for like four generations, all military. So I was interested in the
military. Thought about going to the Air Force, but didn’t want to fly
like my father. I learned about this when I was young. I was kinda drawn
to the team aspect of it. I love the water, so it just kinda made sense.

OK. So did you move around a lot as a kid?

Not too much, I lived in Connecticut and then Arizona. I only moved
once with my dad’s job, then he got to stay in Arizona for a long time.

OK. What about your personality do you think contributed to
making it through BUD/S?

Even keel. I didn’t get really riled up when the instructors would
get in our faces. I stayed pretty calm through most things.

Have you always been like that?

Uh, no. I definitely, like as I matured, I dealt with things a lot
better as I got older. So, like, when I was young, I threw temper
tantrums like every kid. But then going to college, and high school
especially, I matured, and developed an ability to deal with things as
they come.

At what point in your life, like what age were you when you
decided “I want to be a SEAL”?

I was just home for Thanksgiving, and my mom found stuff that I
wrote in Kindergarten.

Really?

Yeah.

Wow, that’s really interesting!

Yeah.

I don’t have enough time to ask you more about that
*laughs*. But, uhm, so, the even keel piece, was that something that you
purposely trained?

My father did.

Really?

My dad would get very upset with me. I would get in trouble if I
had an outburst or if I let emotions control me. So my dad was always,
uh, on me to make sure that I got a good handle on my emotions in a good
way.

Interesting, OK. So, you talked a little bit about your
background, and I’m gonna go a little deeper. Can you tell me a little
bit about your childhood? How, some very specific questions. What was
your parents parenting style?

Definitely hands on. They were very involved with a lot of things.
They made sure that we played sports, made sure we had good grades, and
that we actually spent time studying. Uh, but they weren't like
helicopter parents. They weren’t overbearing by any means. They were
always there, they were, like, uh, if we needed something we could
always go to our parents. Uh, I’m trying to think of a good way….my dad
was gone a lot with the military, so when he was home, he was very
present. I think that helped a lot. Uh, my first year ever playing
football he was deployed to Iraq, and so he made sure that he parentes
record every game and send it to him. Which was kinda cool. So he always
tried his best, even though he wasn’t always around, to be as involved
as possible, and make sure that we knew that they cared, they loved us,
and at the same time, if we did stupid things, they would punish us,
just like every…

So that’s my next question. So what was the, and it seems
like a weird question, but what was their discipline approach? Like,
were you spanked, were you put on time outs?

Yeah. yeah. I mean like every kid probably time outs, then my dad
would spank me, my mom would spank me. If we said bad words they would
wash our mouths out with soap. We’d get grounded, like lose things,
they'd take things away, like show that there's actual consequences in
the world.

The whole gamut.

Oh yeah.

What about your teenage years? You talked about how you
played football, uhm, did you play any other team sports?

Uh, I played baseball, uh, and as far as team goes, I was on a swim
team, that's pretty much individual though.. I shot competitively and I
ran track.

Any other kind of team or group activities beyond sports?

I was in boy scouts and then I was in the student government of my
high school. So as far as teams go that’s about it.

What about when you moved, and you said you moved from
Connecticut to Arizona, how old were you?

I was 6 months. I was really..

Oh so you were little? And then you stayed in Arizona?

Yup.

That’s kinda lucky.

Yeah, my dad went into the reserves so we just got to stay in
Arizona.

Anything else about your teenage years that were kinda
formative, or stand out?

Growing up in Arizona was great because I was forced to do a lot of
outdoors stuff. So I grew up in the woods and mountains, which I think
really helped here, just being really comfortable with being outside.
Actually working with my hand. Like I was used to doing physical things
outside. I think that was helpful.

Now I don’t know where you’re coming from directly, but if
there were five years between highschool and coming into here, but if
so, what were you doing those five years?

I went to the Naval Academy.

OK.

So four years of college there and then I took the last class
available from my graduating year so it took me a full year after
graduation to get out here to start.

OK, so in that time in particular, what was your Naval
Academy experience, and what was your extra time as an Ensign, I’m
assuming you were a TAD Ensign, so what was that time like?

It was great, I liked the Academy. If I got to go back with the
same outcome I would do it again in a heartbeat, but it was not my
favorite place. I hated the Academy. I wanted to leave, I got talked
into staying, which I’m glad I did. I tried out for the water polo team,
the triathlon team, the combat arms team, got cut from everything, so I
had a hard time finding where I fit in until I joined the parachute team
and then stuck with that that was really fun. I learned a lot there
about high stress environments, and how to actually work when your life
kinda depends on it. So that was great. I got involved with the
leadership conference at the Naval Academy, so I learned how to delegate
and do leadership type things there. Post graduation, doing TAD was
helpful because that time to train before we came out here so we were
physically ready, but nothing really formative as far as like, uh, my
personality.

Now, would you consider yourself, during that time frame,
at the Academy, impulsive at all, or were any of your behaviors
impulsive?

I wouldn’t say I was very impulsive, maybe my freshman year, plebe
year at the Naval Academy, I would make impulsive decisions, but nothing
that I can think of after that was like impulsive which led me to
anything negative.

And, uhm, do you have any tattoos?

No tattoos.

Any speeding tickets?

Yeah, I have one speeding ticket.

OK.

...That i still have to deal with. I just got it here.

So it’s a recent thing?

Yeah. Recent.

What motivates you on a daily basis?

Uhm, I’d say my family.

So, uhm, immediate family, or other family?

Uh, family, my wife, my siblings, my parents, my sister just had a
baby right before we started hell week and I wrote her name, my new
niece’s name in my hat during hell week, and I, like, would look at that
and remember there’s more than just me. It’s about something bigger than
just myself.

What do you think was the most challenging component of
BUD/S? Whether it was broader, or a single event, or day?

Uh, the daily grind, especially in third phase, it was like the
same things, very monotonous, every day, for, whatever it was, 28 days,
with no breaks. So you had to be 100% focused all the time otherwise you
could kinda lose track and not perform as well. So just maintaining that
same level of performance for an extended period of time without any
time to decompress.

So what motivated you to push through that daily grind?

I think that was just like experiences leading up from the rest of
BUD/S. Like knowing that there’s a purpose in the end.It kinda reminds
you like oh there's a purpose why we have to be out here to learn all
these different skills so we can move on to the next part. Kinda like
the ending was the goal, so you knew what was coming.

No what, was there anything, did you feel there waas group
support while you were here or was it more individual?

Definitely group support. I came out here with four other ensigns
from the Naval Academy. We lived together, we trained together for the
full year before coming out here. We were all kinda each other's support
group coming out here. Even though we didn't say it, we were all there
for each other and knew we could count on one another and you wanted to
support them as best as you could and support each other. Then the
people here, obviously, once you get past hell week, after that, you
really start developing bonds with people and you become a support group
for each other. That’s the best part about this place, is the people.

What about, what practices, were there any specific
practices, whether they were physical, mental, spiritual, that you
performed as you progressed through BUD/S?

Uh, for big things that were test gates, visualization was a big
thing. Specifically like pool comp, OC8, in second phase, when there's
all these procedures you have to go through to make sure that you finish
the test, under stress, like visualization before and then during, like
OK, and talking myself through the steps, I would know what to do. I
think visualization was a huge help for me.

Uh, when you made a difficult decision during BUD/S here
during the training, what went through your mind? If there was any kind
of difficult decisions.

That's a good question. Uhm, making difficult decisions, I would
try to always remember what the end state was, like the end goal, and I
think basically, if the decision would help lead us to that desired end
result, then that's what had to be done. There's really no easy way
here, so if it was hard, it didn't really make a difference because
everything was always hard here no matter what. It was almost easier to
make the right decision in BUD/S, because everything was hard as it was.

So it wasn’t like “Oh this is easy *indecipherable*”

Yeah.

Now, what about, do you think you can give any specific
examples of where you might have had some massive decision you had to
make.

Not in BUD/S. Not really, uh, everything is pretty laid out for us,
you don’t have to make a lot of decisions, it’s just show up, perform,
and make sure you have everything you need.

Were there anything ethical or moral decisions you had to
make?

Thankfully, I didn’t really face a lot of things that...like,
there’s shortcuts that can be taken, that you know can be taken, and
knowing the difference of when it was maybe OK to take shortcuts and
when it was not OK to take shortcuts, that could be an ethical decision.
If it would affect other people negatively, then no we didn't do those
things, but if it’s not gonna hurt anyone other than maybe myself, like
sleeping in a boat when we’re paddling around the world during hell
week, like, yeah we did that, we slept in the boat.

Just to get the couple seconds of…*indecipherable*

Yeah. Exactly. But major things that would affect the whole class
or affect anyone else if you were found out, like no we didn’t, and I
didn’t personally do that because we wanted to make sure the other guys
were taken care of because that’s our job.

What do you think made you successful?

I think I was successful because I never gave myself the option of
leaving. Especially as an officer, if you leave you're done. You never
get a chance to come back. I experienced life on a ship, I never wanted
to go back to that, just my opinion. My family... I didn't want to let
my family down. If I quit here, I would never be able to forgive myself,
now would I be able to forgive, I feel like I would have let my family
down, my wife down, everyone that ever supported me. I was never here on
my own, I never would have gotten here on my own in the first place.
People had to throw their hat in the ring for me and I would have let
those people down. And I would have taken a spot from someone else. That
would have all weighed on me very heavily if I would have quit.

What about, uhm, do you think there’s any difference
between what you saw of the people that made it and the people that
didn’t make it?

I mean you would look at kids the first day and be like “Oh, he
looks like a stud, he’s gonna make it” and then they quit the first day.
Nothing physically was indicative of who was gonna make it. I think once
you get to know people, after hell week, you’re like yeah, obviously you
made it, you had a crazy life, you had all these great experiences, but
at the same time, those guys obviously would make it, and those guys
were just regular joes who show up and for whatever reason they just
have that internal motivation or drive to make it. I don’t think there’s
any…

...one answer?

No.

Well, those are all my questions. Thank you and
congratulations.

Thank you very much ma'am, I appreciate it.

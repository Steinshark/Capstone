A: Ok got it, got it 

11: I should have just said three older sisters shouldn’t I?

A: No, so we’re really interested in this family dynamic

11: oh

A: Um, but I’ll stop with that there so if you think of your life experiences what would you describe as your crucible or life shaping experiences? (slight pause) Have you had any? 

11: Hmm, 

A: Tough, hard, you went in one way came out another

11: Uh, I’d say like being baptized

A: Ok

11: For sure

A: When was that?

11: um, I was pretty young, probably 14

A: ok so you went through, uh is this catholic?

11: No, this is christain, nondenominational 

A: Ok

11: baptism 

A: ok

11: um

A: but you went through like uh uh training for that or you went just your family just one day woke you up and said 

11: No, I decided one day

A: Oh you decided

11: ya

A: Ok so um subject (unsure on subject, hard to make out)

11: Crucible or life shaping experience

A: ya, so something uh

11: Well BUD/s is pretty cool 

A: Ya, so before BUD/s

11: ok

A: So childhood, highschool, coll, did you go to college before this?

11: I did

A: ok and so do, was that hard, was that

11: Ya I’d say that that helped 

A: ok

11: Shaped, shape me a little bit, yes

A: ok

11: It was difficult at first, it kinda you know gives you, helps you figure out time management, stuff like that

A: ya

11: so that, would that help shape a lot of things



A: Ok, so when I, the next question, 

SIO: How did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?

A: Would you say time management…

11: I’d say, so the first semester I show up to college I had no idea whats going on, I’m like oh this is not for me, this is just

A: ok

11: chaotic, and then it got, then you’d figure it out, you’d figure out a schedule and then you’re fine and then the next semester its like oh hey I’m freakin out again cause I don’t know all the time management stuff 

A: ya

11: but the second time you know you’re gonna figure it out cause you already did it once so and then every semester from then on is just easier and easier and easier

A: so what would you call that 

11: so, I don’t know, you have a word for it but I don’t think I do. 

A: ah like confidence

11: ya you start to build confidence

A: ok

11: and your abilities to deal with things

A: ok

11: So um ya, that that directly translates over into BUD/s because you show up to BUD/s and you’re just bombarded 

A: ya

11: but you know that you’ll fiii, iii its like being at BUD/s is gonna stay hard but it will get easier cause you’ll understand you’ll ya know what I mean? 

A: yep. so you know that you’ll figure it out 

11: ya I mean you your either going to or your not and 

A: ok 

11: going through those experiences 

A: ya 

11: now you know that what I’m capable so its kinda just a choice

 

A: ya, SIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?

11: umm, (short pause) well I have, I I  I I have a pretty good sense of humor 

A: ok

11: and that is, that was

A: self declared?

11: I mean I I I have most of the time just ya know kind of keeping myself entertained 

A: ok

11: sooo I don’t know, they they hate it but 

A: ok

11: its its how I deal with things 

A: ok, anything else? 

11: um (short pause) um like pretty

A: so personality um, it is your personal traits right, that would predict your behavior for yourself, right, kind of talking about, uh you know, I know that I’ll figure this out cause I know what i’ve done before

11: right 

A: and as also an external view how do others anticipate what you’re gonna do right?

11: ok

A: so 

11: Usually they can’t anticipate what I’m gonna do but I mean I’m fairly confident

A: ok

11: um so that’s huge

A: ya 

11: and if you you believe in yourself but I’m also not like cocky because I had no idea, you know this is like a 50 50 in a way 

A: ya

11: for for me its its like oh we’ll see, hopefully I make it, you know so

A: right

11: I don’t how to put in any other traits (What I think he said, words hard to understand) 

A: Um, not to give you a lecture on it but did we have openness, uhh, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, and neuroticism 

11: extroversion

A: you’re extroverted

11: ya I’d say so 

A: ok, that’s where you get your energy from other people

11: ya 

A: you seek other people out and want to be in social situations 

11: yes

A: ok

11: I guess I do sometimes



A: Great, um, 

SIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming a part of the SEAL community.  

A: So did you come from a military family, did you come from 

11: No I, I wouldn’t call it a military family, I’ve had people in my family that were in the military but my dad wasn’t in the military, my mom wasn’t in the military, nothing like that. My dad’s kinda more like if it doesn’t bother him he doesn’t want to mess with it you know and so 

A: so is there anything, like why the SEALs? 

11: So I met some SEALS

A: ok 

11: um and I have just been in contact with people that have SEALs in their family, like I went to college with a guy whose son was a SEAL and this guy was like an A type personality and he’d already had a career, retired

A: ok

11: he just was going back, he went to a vocational school first so he was like just trying to learn stuff and like seeing him and talking to him about his son and all that stuff it really opened up it opened up like this other world that I didn’t know existed casue I’m like from a really small town and you pretty much you get a house, you get a wife, you get truck and you get a job and you stay there for the rest of your life and that’s it so talking to him about possibilities and stuff was just huge and then also uh there was some SEALs they were uh doing like training at Fort Knox in Kentucky and they ended up becoming friends with one of my friends fathers and they came and hung out with us a lot on the weekends when they had the weekends off from training and just talking to them, picking their brain and I was like oh, these, these are the guys, the guys I want to hang out with ya.

A: ok, ya

11: ya lets do it. 

A: ok



  SIO: Tell me a little bit about your childhood. Um. I’m particularly interested in your family’s style of parenting and discipline. So uh, spanking, versus timeout versus soap

11: ok

A:  in the mouth versus taking away uh you know toys or playstations, video games, things like that. 

11: ok, so I was a pretty wild kid um and I got in, I got in a lot of trouble but it wasn’t like legit trouble it was just, I was always just doing stuff 

A: ok

11: you know, I was pretty hyper so I don’t know, I’d like to give a status quo

A: ok

11: like if they are telling me to get in line in school like for no reason then I’m like

A: was this to an authority

11: ya, in a way 

A: ok, testing boundaries? 

11: yes in way, not anymore not anymore

A: so were you locked up in juvi or anything

11: No no no, it was, like I said, it wasn’t ever real trouble 

A: ok

11: it was, I was a good kid

A: ok, so timeout at home?

11: they let me, my parents let me make my mistakes 

A: ok 

11: and so like I’ve been spanked yes um, i’ve been you know smacked whenever I mouth off you know  

A: uh huh 

11: on the playground 

A: So occasional corporal punishment we’ll say 

11: yes but um I I was never like legitimately grounded or anything um but I I mean I ended up being a good kid, I never had any oh bad intentions or anything

A: sure

11: I was never like like juvenile like nothing like that 

A: ok

11: that’s next level, I never got into like drugs or anything like that 

A: ok 

11: I just, whenever I was younger just I was just hyper

A: ok um so did you guys move around did you participate in team sports or any activities that would have a close knit community 

11: um we did not, we did not move around, I’ve lived in the same town all my life um I uh played baseball in the summers when I was a kid 

A: ok

11: and then I got into soccer and soccer was where I really started to like that that clicked with me, like baseball meh 

A: ok

11: never clicked for me

A: ok, did you play soccer at high school, college 

11: ya high school 

A: ok any sports in college

11: I did like, I went to a, this may be laughable but I went to a crossfit gym for awhile and the community there was outstanding, just awesome, super competitive great um I did tae kwondo for twelve years so I was around all that but that more the individual type you know

A: so twelve years 

11: ya 

A: ok, awesome, so like the past five years of your life, prior to coming to BUD/s um what have you been up to, were you going to school, were you traveling 

11: yes I uh so I worked in a machine shop throughout

A: ok

11: that entire time I was going to college, I did like two years at a sort of vocational college 

A: ok

11: I have two associates degrees, one in precision machining, one in advanced CNC machining and then from there I went and got my bachelors from purdue in industrial technology 

A: ok

11: and um throughout all that I was working and then I was, after that I was I took like a year to where I was just working and training and that that was pretty much it and then I signed up

A: ok would you consider yourself impulsive, do you jump into things, like the decision to enlist or sign up was that impulsive 

11: I knew that I was gonna, I knew that I was going to but if you don’t have that impulse like some people 

A: ok

11: um so I think the decision the decision for me to join at that time I I planned on joing at that time a while back but 

A: ok 

11: the decision was kind of impulsive in way too so it was weird 

A: ok do you um have any tattoos?

11: I have one tattoo 

A: ok, when did you get it

11: I got it when I was eighteen years old 

A: ok, was that impulsive

11: No

A: uhh do you have any speeding tickets or other sort of reckless behavior

11: uh I have one speeding ticket

A: uh ok, is it bad

11: No

A: ok

11: it was just funny

A: um what about, what motivates you on a daily basis

11: (12 second pause)  so there are like you know cliche answers that are still basically true um you know coming in here and being with these guys once I’m here is huge like it’s you can’t be unmotivated being around this caliber of person um you now not not including myself these guys are just incredible you know I am very very uh its very humbling to work with them um but I would say legitimately just like the uh patriotism and like there is a conflict of good and evil in the world 100% and I think the fact like if if you know you don’t do anything when you are perfectly able and are in a position um especially being in this position you’re gonna be directly tasked with taking care of some serious issues like mitigating the amount of damage that evil can do for this way of life. So the AMerican way of lifes very motivating too and some people don’t have to worry about anything and its great cause you want to preserve that as much as you can. Um

A: You feel like you are part of something bigger than yourself

11: 100% because ya because I think human beings, well I can’t say that um ya I feel like, I I was pretty selfish for a long time and you know being around these guys really, theres no room for selfishness its awesome, um I feel like I’m enjoying a lot of the freedoms that the American way of life has to offer and it’s definitely time for me to sacrifice you know for like thats another part of motivating me thats you know even if you look down on yourself for anything its like hey man you’ve enjoyed a lot so you know you signed up for this so do what you signed up to do um and do it to the best of your ability and just thats just pretty motivating just to get the most that you can out of it and the most that you can into it because those two are like directly related the more you put into it the more you get out of it and its not like like you’re taking away from this community selfishly it’s like you are just benefiting as a you are becoming a better person by being evolved in this community its it’s just pretty motivating like that’s motivating but that’s like a round about rabbit hole answer. 

A: That was not cliche, I think it’s genuine

11: Ok, cool  

A: ya, uhh

11: I don’t know what cliche means 

A: No uhh you said all of, you hit all of the cliche boxes 

11: ok

A: But there is a differences between 

11: right

A: sort of being right and believing it 

11: right ahh patriotism 

A: ya 

11: ahh 

SIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? (Holistic question) (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S) so was there a hardest day or hardest event

11: (Long pause) Holistic question, think about your, holistic question, what’d you what does that mean? 
A: oh um so like thinking of your entire BUD/s experience from start to finish was there a point that stands out as like hard right, like

11: ya um

A: was there was there a point where you thought about quitting was there something that really pushed you to the limit

11: You know I always thought that I would think about that um so the CS gas on the island sucked, that was terrible 

A: ok

11: um that like that that’s just terrible 

A: ok

11: that was so terrible

A: ok so what got you through it, what motivated you to get through that 

11: so what’d you ya mean you’re in third phase on the island and you know you’re gonna take it, that’s just the way it is, it’s theres 

A: There’s no alternative 

11: no alternative 

A: okay and did you feel supported by the group

11: 100% I actually felt held down by a couple of my buddies like just cause you know you got your arms stuck together 

A: ok

11: that was that was rough um friday morning, err early friday morning at like four five a.m. of Hell week was like I was cold I was like I was 

A: I’m sorry what day of hell week was it 

11: Friday

A: Friday

11: Early Friday like five o’clock in the morning, when the suns about to come up but it’s still not up, it’s just like you’ve been at it all week and I was just like there was I was just quitting wasn’t even on the table, it was just like just was you’re like I don’t know your body just, they told us to hit the surf and I was just so infuriated because we’re already so like whatever anyways you hit the surf and it’s freezing and I came up and I’m like, you ever seen the scene in like wolverine just like grrrrrr that’s how I was, I was just pissed like that sucked but it was also funny every everything is awesome hindsight, once it’s all done it’s all fun and funny and it’s great but I remember like looking at my buddy and i’m like on a boat and he’s on a boat and I’m looking at him and we’re sarcastically doing it but we’re like acting like cause it’s friday of hell week you know and nobodies gonna quit  

A:  ya 

11: that sucked 

A: are there any practices, physical mental or spiritual that you use to push through challenges so you mentioned baptism do you pray do you meditate do you have like a stretching routine before you do anything physical  

11: ya I practice (unintelligible) uh visualization is huge 

A: ok

11: visualization if you like that helped me so much just just going through the event like whatever we were doing in my brain first and you know it also ensured that you actually knew what you were doing because if you are like visualizing something and then you’re like hey what’s this like you don’t know what it means so you can study up on it more and then come back visualize visualize and just do runs like that cause there was times on the island where we were doing runs with weapons and it’s like I don’t really know what the hell’s going on and then you visualize visualize visualize it and your still like oh I don’t know what’s happening and then their like go and then you just do exactly what you just visualized, it’s just crazy and per per as well for sure 

A: ok 

11: whenever whenever it’s something cause you know those times where you feel overwhelmed 100% and it’s like hey man ah you know you put this on my heart to do this so whatever you want to happen, that’s cool you know whatever your will is that’s great and he’s he’s been super supportive the whole time     

A: ok

11: I think he’s really been helping a lot 

A: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/s what went through your mind as you made that decision? Can you give me an example, can you recall a moment of ah making a decision that was tough, I know you don’t make very many decisions for yourself when you’re in BUD/s right? Most of it’s kind of structured for you    

11: right

A: But can you recall a time when you had to make a decision and you what you annn and wha what what you felt? 

11: well I guess when you said with any decision you make you’re thinking about how it’s gonna relate to all the other guys um how it’s gonna affect others 

A: is there a particular uh example that you have 

11: ya like if you know you’re trying to, like let’s say you’re gettin beat they tell you to shutup don’t say a word just take ok that’s great but in my mind I’m always like what happens if I start yelling like what happens if like instead of keeping quiet I’m just gonna start counting loud cause what are they gonna do you know you’re just getting the boys fired up it makes everything way easier and they don’t like you being motivated at the end of it they just beat us more but we’re it’s gonna be even easier. So like you think about, I always thought about that uhh should I should I and then I always do, you know so whatever

A: haha, ok, ok

11: you know thinking about how it like affects others, then it’s like hopefully the guys understand if that’s not what the instructors actually want   

A: ok

11: hopefully they get it but

A: ok, its what they want 

11: what

A: it’s actually what they want you know

11: ya of course

A: ok  

11: if they don’t then we get the blame anyway 

A: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/s right, and what do you think about those who didn’t complete, like what’s the difference, what’d you have that they didn’t 

11: um I’m pretty, I’m average joe physically, um

A: ok

11: So somehow my brain likes learning new stuff

A: ok 

11: and like that’s just what I like so 

A: would you say curious 

11:  ya ya i’d say that, I genuinely enjoyed taking like on the new stuff cause

A: ya 

11: it’s like hey this something I’ve never done, this is this should be fascinating um also like having having family you know I can call family anytime, anytime I was having troubles just talk to them you know talk to talk to my my girlfriend who is actually really really strong person

A: ok

11: so talking to my dad my mom

A: a strong network of support

11: Absolutely and then also one thing for me which was also I guess I’ll tie into the wall is like you know me like believing in God believing in like the gospel and stuff, like having that network of support, I mean it’s amazing to get the people that come through here 

A: ya

11: that that don’t have that faith, it’s like you are a very very very strong person you know it’s it’s I nobody’s right or wrong I don’t you know it’s believe in whatever you believe in is fine it’s just like wow you your the strongest I I have to I have to have something you know it’s just the way that my brain works and what I believe so I don’t know 

A: ok so for those that didn’t make it what did you think was their, did you recognize anything a trend for people who dropped or were dropped?

11: ya people, people who are overly selfish and uh people who are not physically ready

A: ok 

11: and um 

A: so you can get through if you are physically average but if your you don’t meet that standard that minimum standard 

11: ya ya I mean that there is a standard I never I never had a problem meeting the standard um it’s you know some stuff I did well really well at physically some stuff was a little bit harder but still you gotta meet the standard um but ya there are some exceptional athletes here, that’s why I am average

A: ok 

11: um

A: anything else for others that didn’t make it so if we were to put in a screening tool say 

11: you know they they some guys come in and an they like the idea of it but they never never have any intention of completing it for like actually completing it, it’s super weird you see it all the time like this guy has no idea what this is and he just wanted a taste, it’s just super strange

A: ok, um so like a distorted idea of the reality of it 

11: ya and also I I was very very fortunate thats I was successful because I was super fortunate that I didn’t have injuries, some people had injuries and like that can really tie into their decision making with you know how  difficult different evolution are so I was super super fortunate

A: so your health 

11: yes 

A: and other so when you say fortunate I think luck, do do you want to say that your lucky or 

11: I mean I I wouldn’t say that, it just seemed like all the guys made it great like all the guys, it it was just good ya a good situation great situation, I had a great class

A: ok

11: and that that was was really fortunate you know cause some classes suck and it makes everything a lot harder                        

A: ya ok so maybe uh ok so how did this so first, did this experience change you, going through BUD/s and if so how?

11: It really highlighted a lot of flaws that I you know sometimes it like the town I grew up in I was surrounded with people I had known my entire life so you are not really gonna get any new feedback like they’ll just accept you for the way you are like here if there’s something that that there’s a character trait that you have um that’s gonna be adverse to the team, their gonna let you know about it so you can fix it    

A: so you feel like you’ve grown

11: 100% in into something that will be more beneficial for me and I have a lot of growing to do a ton of growing to do, left just like 

A: so even just awareness that you need to  

11: absolutely awareness, awareness that’s a great word 

A: huge umm this is the first step right

11: yes 

A: is there anything that I didn’t cover in the survey that you think that we should ask or that you want to tell us um cause we really are interested in what gets somebody through

11: really

A: yep 

11: How the heck can you quantify grit and resiliencey, how how can you do that

A: I’m happy to give you some of our uh uh background behind it, is there anything from your experience from this that we’re not asking or is there a trait or something that you brought to the table that, if not I can we can cut it and we can

11: I’m ok

A: ok cool

in black):\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nAre you good with me recording this interview? Just some softball questions to start. When did you start BUD/S? What class did you start BUD/S with?\r\n\r\nOriginally 2014, so I was with 306 and then DOR\u2019d.\r\nSo you were with 306 and DOR\u2019d.\r\nYea, and then I went to IT school\r\nSo when you came back what class did you start with?\r\nI started with 338\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n3 siblings, three younger brothers.\r\nSo theres you and them.\r\nI am the oldest.\r\nYou\u2019re the oldest. SIO: How old are you?\r\n\r\n33.\r\nAnd then what about the others?\r\nSo lets see, the next one down would be uhh 32.\r\nBrother or sister?\r\nAll brothers. Then 31. Sorry he\u2019s 32 and the next one is 27. Sorry thats a mistake, whoops.\r\n\r\nUhh.. Parents married or divorced, seperated?\r\nMarried.\r\nAlways married growing up?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHow about um whats your relationship like close not close?\r\nClose. Close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Looking at your life experience, what kind of life changing events have happened to you? Like looking back what experience kind of shaped you?\r\nI would have to say umm at an early age I wanted to.. Unintelligible at 2:58. I wouldn\u2019t say life changing yup just my experience at a young age (unintelligible 3:08-3:13)\r\n\r\nWhat role do you think those experiences played at BUD/S?\r\nUhh they definitely helped out responsibility wise timeliness, just being on time and understanding timelines. Working back when your beat, time management, and getting things done in the least amount of time. (Unintelligible 3:38-3:47). Manual labor. (Unintelligible 3:49-4:01)\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\nUmm I think I\u2019m older than most of the guys I think maturity helped me out a bit and to allow myself to see a situation for what it is and not let it take over your mind (Unintelligable 4:22-4:37).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What about your background leading you up to wanting to be apart of a SEAL community? Did you have any SEAL friends, family or military friends or family?\r\nSo my second youngest brother was an officer in the Coast Guard, and the brother between he and I was a did intel with the Air Force.\r\nOutside of that, he what?\r\nHe did intel.\r\nThe one in the Coast Guard?\r\nNo the one in the Coast Guard, (unintelligible) 5:02-5:09.\r\nOkay, yep. And the other brother enlisted in the Air Force and did Intel.\r\nYea but no I didn\u2019t really have any friends or family who were SEALs. I didn\u2019t really know anyone personally.\r\n\r\nWhat about a little bit about your childhood? How were you disciplined as a child? Were your parents strict, were they loose? Did they spank you? Did they withhold toys?\r\nYup, they ahh we grew up in a Christian household so yea definitely got spanked if you messed up which you came to appreciate. You would get grounded for a 2 week grounding. Consequences were real and you learned that very quickly.\r\n\r\nHow about did you move around a lot?\r\nNot really, nah so we grew up in one spot until I was about 15, and then we moved in the same town but from the farm to in town. It was still rural.\r\n\r\nWhat about your teenage years?\r\nHow about umm team sports any activities? Yea uhh I\u2019m from a small farm town so I played a lot of sports. Basketball, baseball, football, and yea.\r\nAnyone in particular?\r\nUhh, baseball was my passion. Baseball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhh What about the last 5 years leading up to BUD/S? Uhh like what were you doing in those last five years leading up to BUD/S? So, coming into 338? Yes. 5 years, so I started off in IT A School and then screened for DamNeck to be a support guy and then umm quickly got to DamNeck and uhh finished up the training I needed to get pretty quickly and then worked and then worked on Squadron Gold. How long were you there? 4 years. 4 years. April 15 to March 19. So uhh did you want to be a SEAL before you went to DamNeck or? Yea so I uhh DOR\u2019d from BUD/S the first time in 2014 I uhh went to IT A school. Oh right, got it. Which I uhh actually didn\u2019t want to do because, you didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to because it would take two more years to get back here. Yea. So I uhh didn\u2019t want to accept and said thank you for choosing me, but I want to get back to BUD/S and then he cut me orders anyways so they sent me there and so when I got there I decided I wasn\u2019t going to piss people off. Yea. So I figured out which job they needed and to do it to the best of my ability. So it actually worked out really well and uhh (laughs) I wouldn\u2019t have planned it any better. It was a great experience. Yea. And then from the group you came here? Yea Orders here? Yea. Yup, okay. Would you consider yourself impulsive? Impulsive, umm not anymore. I would say in the past?10 years oh yea definitely in my younger years more impulsive, more quick to do things. Umm I always had this weird thing where if I even though I was acting impulsively, I was usually planning it out very well still. What about tattoos, do you have any tattoos? Nah no tattoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhh What would you say was probably the most challenging part of BUD/S like hardest day, event? Hmm the most challenging part of BUD/S, hmm thats a really good question. Thats why I\u2019m asking. Yea, I think it probably be, its gotta be the daily grind. You know (unintelligible) BUD/S is a lot of time away from your family. I have a wife and son so thats the hardest part. The hardest physical  part about BUD/S is the daily grind. No one evolution is really that hard. Its just the umm. How many married guys in the class, do you know? Oh in the class, oh uhh 1,2,3, uhh there\u2019s 8. 8.Theres about 8. Anyone with kids besides you? Uhh no uhh there's two guys with kids on the way though. They\u2019ve been asking all sorts of questions. I bet. They and their wives have been asking all sorts of questions. Got it, a lot of questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhh what motivated you to kinda push through, did you feel supported by the group? Uhh coming back this time? Yea. So the first time I didn\u2019t know the class very well which is probably because I didn\u2019t make it. What motivated me a lot this time was just uhh personal motivation to finish something that I started and didn\u2019t finish. I don\u2019t know this one I kinda just needed to finish. And then uhh I just wanted to finish because I got to spend time with some of the best guys the community has and see how they went about their business and that was pretty much it and it was absolute from the beginning that I had no idea how to get back but I always wanted to go back and so I needed to figure it out and I just waited until I got that pointy S from the agency (unitelliable) . Yea I would say that guys that made me  want to do it was the guys that I was working with and a couple guys that died that pretty impacted me who were absolute professionals. Yea and just personality wise just on and off the battlefield. (12:40-12:50 unintelligible, voice gets very soft). So yea uhh trying to meet that standard, exceed, obviously try and exceed it. Also knowing that I have superhumans I am trying to live up to. Yup. Uhh yea that would probably be it for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. SIO: What did you have any practices see umm physical, mental, spiritual that you   utilized daily? Uhh I would say spiritual I am a Christian so Mhmm. My thing is if you have something you pray about it and I have talked to some of the guys in the class and prayed about it and that type of thing you pray about it. Yea. You aren\u2019t going to do that four mile timed runs with God you kinda have to do that yourself and just kinda trust that the Good Lord upstairs will help make it a little easier and set up for success. But with that you kinda have to put out for yourself, at least thats my kinda philosophy with it. (Unintelligible 14:10-14:16).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhh what about umm difficult decisions at BUD/S? Did you ever have to struggle with some  decision you had to make while you were here? Uhh like running out classmates? Uhh Cheating? Classmates Yea I would say a lot of cheating, I wouldn\u2019t say it was a decision, but I would say watching really good dudes go or watching really good dudes have something unfortunate happen, whether it was physical which it was most of the time and just knowing that there was that handful of guys that were around that guy that could\u2019ve helped him out but were saving themselves and uhh some of those guys are still here today. I guess that's not a decision. Yea but uhh. I guess the most difficult decision is to just continue going everyday just to continue training, but then again I guess its not that hard. Uhh thats a loaded question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in getting through BUD/S? Uhh I would have to say the biggest reason was cause my faith, my belief in a higher power, uhh not necessarily making it easier, but just allowing for the right things to happen at the right time. Yup. For me personally, I just stayed focused and I told myself if I could just stay focused longer and cooler if I could just stay focused longer and cooler than these guys than the experience can go better not only for myself, but everybody else. (Unintelligible 16:23-16:28)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything about the guys who didn\u2019t make it? Yup umm so me being one of em before I would say that you wouldn\u2019t admit it to anybody, but I\u2019d say excuses, guys make excuses. There are two types of people, guys who make excuses and still want to be here Mhmm and then there are guys that realize this is just not for them and those are the guys uhh typically swallow that pill and don\u2019t feel down or negative about themselves at all, they are just like oh I\u2019m really glad I got that out of my system. I definitely got my shot. Yea. which is the preferable of the two because the guy that still wants to be here that ends up living the rest of his life with it Yea. or being fortunate enough like myself to get another chance and come back. It is definitely harder the second time around whether its age or not knowing whats coming. Its definitely better to not know whats coming Yea. I would say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you feel like uhh this experience has changed? Uhh its defineatly created, well this time around I had a lot of leadership resonsiblities. Umm its let me reflect back on my leadership abilties. Being the oldest of four leadership came a bit more naturally to me, not saying that I\u2019m a good leader. Its just the stadnard leadership qualities like knowing how to communicate with people, having three younger brothers and having that leadership role my entire life and my time at work in the Navy, it let me reflect back on some of the other things I still need to work on after 32 years of leaderhip experience, there just always things to be working on.\r\n\r\nWhen did you roll into the class? First phase, so post Hell Week. Good question. And this was the class that was really small. Yes. There were 25 guys, I think there was. 26 and then there was a guy that got rolled right away. It was kind of a weird class because  LT and myself, OIC and LPO were rolled back into the class. They lost all of their leadership in Hell Week so. And its graduating a big number, like how many? 59 guys. 59 guys graduating. What is the average now? The average of BUD/S classes? Yea. Hmm, it is in the 50s. Okay so you guys mid 50s maybe low 60s. We are right on par, but then my original class made it through Hell Week with 73 and got like 20 roll backs, but then we also rolled a lot back into 338, I was like this is ridiculous that they are moving this many guys back. Its pretty clear now and I\u2019m glad I got my shot at resonsbility. But they moved so many. Yea one half of 338 stayed 338 and the other half became 339. We outnumber the original 338 guys. Was that number after Hell Week uhh then theres the Bee Hive and a whole bunch of 338. Yea I went through the Bee Hive. Greg Seeker. Greg which Yea it was pretty unique scenario because when we all left I was looking around at the few 338 guys and was like how does that happen, but I was like I\u2019m just going to do my thing. Interesting. Unintelligable (20:24-20:40)\r\n\r\nAnything else that you think I should be asking you that didn\u2019t come up? Umm I noticed that some of the guys that maybe I didn\u2019t know as well from the start of BUD/S and as you know I\u2019ve been here before, but I notice that guys change. Guys have changed here and I would say that that is a decision that its not about me anymore. When do you think they change? I think  they start changing around 2nd Phase after OC-8 umm  where you start getting into dives and that is the first time that guys really take a breath and say you know some guys going to be able to do it and thats when they are going to make that decison. Yea And them umm they are going to make it to third phase and you start to realize wow I\u2019ve noticed taht this guy is a top performer and what guys have been a turd the whole time I don\u2019t know but somewhere along the line he made a decison to not be a turd anymore. And its like when did he start acting like that right after first phase, Pool Comp and then you get the tanks, Dreger Hell Week, in the classroom chatting with his buddies who are also making that decision and its the whole thing that like people attract like people. Okay, yup. Awesome. Yea, I would just say that I uhh guess a question that I have myself is, well you kinda asked this yourself. Yea! Unintelligable (22:33-22:47). Well uhh hopefully, we connect with you guys after your first deployment and then you will really see how much guys have changed. Gosh, its going to be great. Yea I\u2019m excited for these guys too. Yea. Want these guys to come back more mature, maybe more frustrated in some areas, but just less stressed in other areas. Yea. But yea I guess that doesn\u2019t even matter after the first depolyment. Yea. Yea I\u2019m just excited to see these guys and their growth. Unintelligable (23:30-23:23:43). Awesome. Alright, thank you number 1, appreciate it. Chuckles. Very helpful, it was great. Toss this over on the table? Yup, thank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jesse Hall\r\n\r\nDate: 1/16/2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 3\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in blue): CDR Andrew Ledford\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): #3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Alright so I'm with um candidate number 3?

So how so like what kind of people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of them was uh one of my mentors- was a retired senior chief -  and the stories he told me about the teams and everything else he\u2019s done definitely attracted me to the teams\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo he was just a family friend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo actually I just met him by coincidence, and then talked from there and then talking to him I read pretty much every book I could find about the teams and went from there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR:Um what about your personality do you think contributed toward you getting through BUD/S?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3:  I\u2019d say just [unitelligible] the biggest thing is probably just not quitting all this [unintelligible] just finish whatever I start, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the biggest thing that just kept me going and then always with the attitude of uh expecting the worst case scenario and then not really caring too much about it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Good...

Like a day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3:  For alike a week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA week?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I would just hang out with friends.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo way so definitely a little bit beyond just time outs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah, they really brought their, both my parents are from the Philippines, so they brought uh some traditions back with em\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019d consider them very traditional Phillipino?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah for the most part yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking about your teenage years a little bit, did you guys move around a lot, did you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh we bounced around a little bit but not nothing crazy um I\u2019d say like when we were like 8 or 9 we bounced around a couple states but pretty much we settled w settled when we were like 12, 13 and stayed there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBounced around a little bit, did you move multiple times around that time like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh just to the same spots\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh okay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah just from Michigan to Ohio so just two states just for uh parents work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about um sports and activities, what kind of sports and activities did you-?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI played football, did uh wrestling and uh track as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich one would you say, football, wrestling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say the heaviest was probably football, really got into that. Wrestling I really did only one year, my senior year and then track did 3 years, but mostly involved in uh really [unintelligible] football and that when I got PT [unintelligible] in football\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn football?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you say in the last 5 years, your experiences in the last 5 years that have really contributed to you being here or you getting through the training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm just uh I was originally with Class 306 and that was 6 years ago so that really uh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh really wow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep, so literally just getting back like the first few years was really every day just thinking about getting back and what am I doing to get back, so that was a big one, and then um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo 306, did you did you quit 306?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh I was uh performance dropped in uh week 3 of first phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou did what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance failed or dropped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah mhm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo just the really big drive to get back in it again, and then another big one was just family uh the death of my brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of my uh brother was a big contributing factor keeping me going the last years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry to hear that um which brother was this was this the oldest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh no actually my youngest uh I\u2019m 30 uh he\u2019s the 4th, so I have uh 3 brothers, not including myself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh okay so he was the younger brother?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh okay so you had 4?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah not including myself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so you were\u2026.4 and how many years younger was?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was 6 years younger than me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 years\u2026.Younger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYounger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYounger, oh wow\u2026 and younger brother\u2026. How many years ago did that happen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2017, so uh 2 years ago\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand sorry to ask all these questions about him but uh what we\u2019re interested in is what makes people who they are, and probably a good portion of this is on your younger brother\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo would you say that\u2019s probably one of the hardest experiences-?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah without a doubt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not something uh was it unexpected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah very he was killed by a uh drunk driver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry dude\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah [unintelligible] was totally surprised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when you were when you were going through BUD/S what were the experiences that motivated you, not experiences but what things motivated you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019d say just the guys next to ya, or the guys next to me that was the biggest thing just seeing them, if they were having a bad time just it can\u2019t be that bad obviously you want to help out your buddy you grow and you form really good connections with em so like you really wanna see your good friends make it through as well, you do whatever you can to get em through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was the most challenging component for you getting through, not just an evolution or activity but could be overall like what did you think the hardest time in your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know I\u2019d say the hardest part was just getting back but uh I\u2019d say during like physical or just overall?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust overall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say just the grind but uh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grind?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah but it\u2019s not really that it really wasn\u2019t that bad I\u2019d say, not a contributing factor but it never made me consider not continuing, I\u2019d say the hardest part was just getting back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, you talked about like the grind, what do you think it was that kept you that motivated you to stick through it with the grind?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I guess before I even start with getting back, I guess there wasn\u2019t even an option of quitting, so like probably the only way I was getting out was my performance or like injuries, just had that expectation that it\u2019s going to get worse or something worse is going to happen so it\u2019s not that bad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere there practices, like anything you did on a consistent basis, like could\u2019ve been spiritual, could\u2019ve been mental, physical, something that you did on a normal basis that would help you get through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I would say just having a light attitude and just not really caring too much about like nothing too far ahead and just living in the present, really just staying relaxed, I think just during the training or even ater, staying relaxed and enjoying the training when I\u2019m off\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm when people talk about enjoying their time going through BUD/S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah exactly, the small things just to enjoy it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there a point at all in BUD/S where you had to make some kind of difficult decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I\u2019d say um probably Hell Week where um there\u2019s some people just not carrying their weight and you just gotta push past it and I learned you can try running em out but like you have to keep the pace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have to keep the pace with like running boats or what not and somebody can\u2019t keep up and it\u2019s just a shitty ass situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what about that what kind of situation did you have to make that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I would say based on the person that was, if it was good person from, if he was just having a bad day then yeah obviously you\u2019d try to carry him through that evolution but if it\u2019s like constant like throughout the entire pipeline they\u2019ve been slacking or just being a turd, alright well he\u2019s not contributing he hasn\u2019t been helping with the boat crew, it\u2019s time to just keep pushing through, if you can\u2019t keep up you can\u2019t keep up that kinda deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so what would you guys, what would what would happen like did you what would go from there[unintelligible] like a decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah our entire boat crew would just [unintelligible] push through, go faster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh okay, the boat crew would kind of like pick up the pace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind of the intentionally leave him behind or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep, mainly if they\u2019re like one of those guys that been a problem since day one, kind of just like hanging on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why would that why was that the most difficult decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean ya uh you know because every single guy that\u2019s here wants to be here and it\u2019s their dream and for the most part they\u2019re they\u2019re 100% committed to the class, the team, and every body else, but sometimes they\u2019re just not at the time physically ready and you know like definitely some of them are still around but it\u2019s just not helping the class\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd do you feel like you were a part of that too or kind of an observer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind of part of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what do you think things that made you successful at BUD/S what do you think those things were like why do you think you\u2019re here and other people aren\u2019t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say probably just living in the moment and the biggest thing is probably just not caring to much about like any beatings or just looking at the small things and just having fun with it, I just find the humor in everything. That was probably the biggest thing just, yeah you\u2019re getting hammered and you see somebody just make a weird sound or whatever and you see another guy [unintelligible] get hammered and he\u2019s in the same boat as you, just laughing at the small stuff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat helped out, just not really caring too much about any of the beatings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm and did you notice anything different about the guys who are not here anymore, was there something different about them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019d say the biggest thing uh pretty sure the stronger guys or guys you thought were mentally tough, they may not be consistent with the way they acted, like may be [unintelligible] or like getting down on themselves, that was the weirdest contributing factor for some of the guys, or not really being present and thinking too far ahead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwesome, alright, perfect, that\u2019s awesome dude, alright, I appreciate it I think that\u2019s it I think that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: GELBACH\r\n\r\nDate: 09 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 4\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 24:39\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m going to record this, you good with that?\r\n\r\nYeah Absolutely.\r\n\r\nUh, just helps with my notes, um and let\u2019s see, what\u2019s your, so you\u2019re number 4 and 379, kay.

Alright, I\u2019m gonna ask you, I\u2019m just gonna give you some softball questions to get started with\r\n\r\nOkay perfect\r\n\r\nUh you good with us recording this?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nOkay. Uh when did you start BUD/S\r\n\r\nUm so with class 338 um (unintelligible 1:15-1:17) prep, so that would have been end of May kind of beginning of June.\r\n\r\nOkay, started with 338 and this is your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\nYes sir\r\n\r\nOkay. uh siblings, how many siblings do you have\r\n\r\nUh so i have kind of a confusing family, so with me and my uh with my mom and my dad its me and my oldest sister, uh she\u2019s 27\r\n\r\nSo you, how old is, how old are you.\r\n\r\nUh I\u2019m 30.\r\n\r\n30? And then your sister is 27?\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s 27 and then I have an older stepbrother, who\u2019s uh 31, and then another older stepbrother who\u2019s 34.\r\n\r\nYour brother 31?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAnd stepbrother 34?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nBut you didnt, did you live with them kind of growing up?\r\n\r\nUm so we moved in with the one who\u2019s 34 when I was 10, um and then my stepbrother Mike was 31, he always lived with his mom.\r\n\r\nOkay. So uh lived together, almost part of the family.\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\nUm so parents uh, for you, were they married the whole time, divorced?\r\n\r\nUm yeah my mom and my dad probably separated when I was 4, divorced by the time I was probably 6\r\n\r\nOkay, 4. Um and then you, did you live with your mom, dad?\r\n\r\nUh yeah so I was with my mom and then um when I was 10 my mom got remarried and moved in um with my stepfather\r\n\r\n(unintelligible 3:10-3:22). Were you close with any, mom, dad, stepdad?\r\n\r\nYeah, absolutely, um very close with all 3, um closest with my mom for sure um. Really fluid relationship with my dad, probably more like a, you know, best friend, older brother type relationship with him, not quite as much of like a, you know, kind of overbearing parent, um, and then also really close with my stepdad also\r\n\r\nOkay. Okay. Looking at life changing events that happened before BUD/S.\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nIs there something that happened that kind of really affected you?\r\n\r\nUh for sure, um so my father passed away in a construction accident when I was 23, uh, so that definitely rocked my world.\r\n\r\nAnything before that, you might?\r\n\r\nUm, honestly not, you know, I went to um, I went to boarding school um you know in high school so that was like a little bit of a change, but um you know I was definitely interested and willing, but um, you know I think I got used to being pretty independent, you know, from a from a fairly young age, and, and probably also I think that really like, you know,  helped me to kind of like, you know, cause you\u2019re going through puberty and all this stuff and you\u2019re having to, alone and like build some really close friendships and like really value those friendships\r\n\r\nAnd that is my next question is how do you think those experiences factored into your experience here at BUD/S\r\n\r\nYeah, I I think that definitely just kind of being willing to reach out and uh opening yourself up to the guys, and, you know, whether its uh a happy occasion or you\u2019re feeling a bit stressed you need to kind of vent, um, feeling comfortable doing that, um, definitely makes things more sustainable\r\n\r\nKay. What do you think about your personality in particular that helps contribute to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s unique about your personality?\r\n\r\nYeah, um, I don\u2019t really think anything is too unique, honestly, I mean, pretty good sense of humor, uh, kinda sarcastic, so uh you know I think that definitely helped me to take everything with a little bit of a grain of salt and kind of look past some of the you know BUD/S games that are meant to really like, you know, make everything seem more apocalyptic and stressful than it is, um, you know, definitely uh you know, make good friends fast and I think that\u2019s, you know, probably the biggest thing for me\r\n\r\nGood group of guys here. How about your background did you have any SEAL family, friends, uh military members.\r\n\r\nUm\r\n\r\nKind of anything like that?\r\n\r\nUm so um you know in my family like my grandfather, sure, my uncles, but um one of my best friends from high school um went to the Naval Academy and has been in the teams for a couple of years, so, um, I think he was kind of one of the main uh, factors, that, you know, as I got a little bit older and totally went a different direction, helped kind of, like, continue to uh kind of like pique my interest and uh keep like the blood stirring a little bit\r\n\r\nSo he\u2019s probably the one who probably planted the seed more than anything?\r\n\r\nUm so it was definitely something I was like always super fascinated by, really curious, like as a little kid, you know, kind of like running around on a Friday night like painting our faces camouflage and whatever, totally like um went in a different direction, definitely, um, you know my mom was not particularly infatuated with the idea uh um and, you know, um, went to college, like, was working in New York City, kind of uh, you know, ended up kind of circling back, but um, but yeah, so, so my buddy Sander like, you know, just a really good friend, but keep up with him and uh, you know, totally like kind of hit it off, just, just as friends and he he comes from like the blue-blooded Naval Academy military family, like his dad was a colonel, two of his brothers went to the Naval Academy and like um, so, you know, he just kind of the only thing that he knows and so uh, just really cool you know, how like picking his brain about NSW and obviously like talk to somebody really candidly\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nCause like when you know,\r\n\r\nYeah for sure\r\n\r\n my experiences with like recruiters was just like the exact opposite, you know, no one knows anything and its just kind of like,\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nyou know, yeah, like, do better on google\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nSo, um, so yeah so he he definitely was a a really special like resource and kind of mentor for me through the whole like um decision making process.\r\n\r\nHow about your um childhood, um, like how was the uh, were you disciplined as a child or what was the parenting style?\r\n\r\nUm, you know um, I think I was given a lot of lee way honestly, um, you know, um, I was generally always a pretty good kid, and um, I think my parents were always like super bear with me, um, really for the most part like it would, would would really have only been like my mom doing any of like the serious parenting moment, like um.\r\n\r\nAny spankings or?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nTimeouts?\r\n\r\nYeah, like probably a a \u201cgo to your room\u201d you know.\r\n\r\nYeah, have some alone time. So she was mostly the disciplinarian here with her?\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah, I mean so even um. So so yeah I mean so even though like my step dad\u2019s always been in my life he was never really like, he\u2019s just a super like laid back easy going dude, um, you know, so he wasn\u2019t really ever like very assertive and so I know its kind of like \u201cokay, send him home, he really fucked up\u201d like whatever you know, just.\r\n\r\nRight\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a super supportive, um, really good guy, but just kind of always like defaulted to my mom in those more,\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\nYou know, kind of serious situations.\r\n\r\nKay. Um, what kind of moving, did you guys move around a lot?\r\n\r\nUm, not a not a whole lot, um, was born in the South River so uh Boston um, (unintelligible 10:59-11:02) and uh you know, and then my dad was always in uh (unintelligible 11:06-11:08) uh, so we\u2019d like go up there on the weekends, um. Then my mom got remarried uh, we moved to Chelmsford Massachusetts, so like, uh, you know, 20, 25 minutes away. Um, I guess like the boarding school experience though was probably um, you know, a little bit unique not necessarily in that like you\u2019re moving but you know kinda making new friends, meeting people from all over the place.\r\n\r\nWhat about uh, team sports, activities, what did you do in your teenage years?\r\n\r\nYeah definitely like a huge part of my childhood um, you know, always played football, lacrosse, um when I was a little kid played everything, baseball, soccer, et cetera, um, and then, um, you know played both football and lacrosse in high school and college.\r\n\r\nWhich one did you, you played both, was there one that you were more focused on?\r\n\r\nUm, yeah I played both, um, football was kind of like my first love, but I was a better lacrosse player, um, and I only played two years football in college, um four years lacrosse.\r\n\r\nSo what about the five years, five years prior to you coming to BUD/S? Walk me through kind of what, what did you do for those five years before you went to BUD/S.\r\n\r\nUm, so I graduated, um, I was 23 when I graduated college, um, and so\r\n\r\nWhere did you graduate from?\r\n\r\nUh, Tufts University, um, so moved to New York City with my girlfriend, and uh started working at a construction management firm and basically, you know, um, did that for, I think, three years, little bit, give or take, um, and then um Sierra and I hit a little rocky patch at the time, and I was kind of like burnt out on New York City somewhat um, so I spent, I, I went out to Jackson, Wyoming um and spent winter as a ski bum out there with some high school buddies, um, and basically you know had some money saved up from the city, um, found a job, like, flipping burgers at this restaurant on the mountain, so I was really only working like two days a week, and mostly just, just skiing all the time.\r\n\r\nHow long do you think you were there, approximately?\r\n\r\nUm six months, ski season basically\r\n\r\nSix months. And then after that BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYeah I did. Er so no uh there was like probably another year and a half in there, um so um\r\n\r\nAt Jackson?\r\n\r\nNo so I did like a, did like a big road trip after that, uh, and then uh, then I came back home and my uh, my my parents have uh an old farmhouse they were like renovating up in Maine, and uh, my step dad runs an oyster farm up there, so there\u2019s like tons of projects to kinda stay busy with, um, so I was like doing kinda odds and ends for my folks and working on an oyster farm, kind of getting in shape, um.\r\n\r\nAll that was about another year and a half?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAnd BUD/S.\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nCompulsive?\r\n\r\nImp, Impulsive.\r\n\r\nImpulsive?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nNo, not, no. (Unintelligible 14:58-15:00). Not at all.\r\n\r\nAny tattoos?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was probably the most challenging thing of BUD/S? Like what was the hardest like that you had to\r\n\r\nUm. I mean honestly for me I think it was like, the hardest part was making the decision to come and actually pull the trigger and do it, um, cause I think that that\u2019s where like, you know, I was really like you know, cause it was a hundred percent you know I understood that like I\u2019m signing a blank check so this is what, you know, um, this is gonna be the reality and, no, no kind of other option, so, uh, I, I think personally like that was where I was kind of like, are you sure, okay are you sure you\u2019re sure, um, cause, yeah, just, kind of, just needed to know that I was a hundred percent invested, and yeah so, I think, I think that was where, you know, ment, mentally for me was the hardest part.\r\n\r\nWhat, uh, and what kind of pushed you through, like what made you decide when you finally said it was pulling the trigger?\r\n\r\nUm, you know I think just kinda continuing having more and more conversations with you know, my, my parents, loved ones, and just kind of like, um, you know, realizing that like I did like have their support, and this wasn\u2019t gonna just be apparently some kind of like, you know, selfish crusade to go on, or you know, not gonna be like torturing everyone, making them step on my whatever, so yeah.\r\n\r\nWhere there any practices that you did like on a daily basis like, visible, mental, spiritual practices that kinda helped you get through or anything?\r\n\r\nUm. No, n not really I don\u2019t think, I mean I, I think that like I\u2019m definitely I\u2019m not at all like a, like a religious person, but um, I definitely would, especially like in phase like on the weekends, I would try and like, you know, wake up kind of early I maybe just kind of instituted that on my own, and then kinda get out on the beach and just kinda hang and, not really, not really think about anything, just, you know, um, I really love uh the outdoors, and so I would go and get in some kind of like uh beautiful natural place\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\nAnd just kind of like reset, um, I, I think is definitely something I try to do.\r\n\r\nHow long would you reset?\r\n\r\nUm not too long usually like, get an iced coffee, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, just kind of hangout.\r\n\r\nDid you ever have to make a really difficult decision at BUD/S, something that you struggled with, uh, maybe running classmates out or turning in a shitty classmate, or something where you just you grappled with making a decision?\r\n\r\nUm, you know... um I mean I guess there were there was definitely. There was like one moment that comes to mind where we did like... you know the instructors kind of made us run this guy out of a boat, but a at the time you\u2019re just kind of in zombie mode, and, you know, I\u2019m not really sure it was like a conscious decision but like we definitely did do it, um.\r\n\r\nDo what?\r\n\r\nSo it um, the, it was a buddy of mine who had kind of been, kind of been dragging, um, and I think this was Wednesday of Hell Week, um, you know they kind of, they pulled him out of the boat, and then it was, it was all because they they kind of created this boat they were like alright, like, you\u2019re gonna, like you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t keep up, talking to this guy. And we had just kinda finished a chow run, um, gotten to like over by 618, kinda stopped everyone, they were like okay, like Gardner, this person, that person, like get under this boat, like you\u2019re gonna run straight down the beach as fast as you can until Amarant falls out. Um, and uh, yeah, so, we we ran him out twice. But, but again, it wasn\u2019t really like okay like, is this, consciously like, is this the right thing.\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nYou know, or whatever.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like, it wasn\u2019t you guys uh making that decision you were just basically.\r\n\r\nYeah collectively right we were kinda told to. But ot other than that really like there\u2019s, you know, can\u2019t can\u2019t really do anything that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nIs that something that\u2019s bothered you?\r\n\r\nUm no I mean I couldn\u2019t really help but think that like maybe he got did a little bit dirty, but um no, not really.\r\n\r\nKay. Why do you think you were successful at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm I, I think I was successful just because like I had really taken the time ahead of time um, you know, to make sure that this is what I wanted to do and that like I had kind of given myself every opportunity not to do it. Um, you know, and so I, I definitely like, you know, signed the blank check when I showed up and um, just kind of put my head down and finished it.\r\n\r\nYeah cause you were uh what, you were 26?\r\n\r\nUm, no so yeah when I went to, so when I went to boot camp I was uh 28.\r\n\r\nOkay. 28?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nSo by the time you got here you\u2019re 29?\r\n\r\nYeah, so, actually today\u2019s my 30th birthday.\r\n\r\nOh, Happy Birthday!\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAlright! So um yeah so you\u2019re one of the older guys in the class?\r\n\r\nYeah, definitely.\r\n\r\nUm, did you notice anything about the guys who didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\nUm.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s different from them than the guys who are here?\r\n\r\nYou know I, I think maybe it's just um, maybe people that didn\u2019t fully understand what they were getting into.\r\n\r\nHow so, they didn\u2019t understand?\r\n\r\nUm, I don\u2019t know, I think that it's easy to you know kinda think about\u2026 potentially being a team guy and it's like okay, this seems awesome, you know, why not give it a shot? And like, you know if that\u2019s really your mentality like, hell, I\u2019ll just, you know, see how it goes, I feel like more often than not those people ar, aren\u2019t successful.\r\n\r\nHow do you, how do you feel like this, ch uh, experience has changed you, has changed you?\r\n\r\nUm, I, I think that like, I don\u2019t know, I mean I think that, in little way I think it\u2019s made me a little bit more emotionally colder *laughs* like I definitely, I, I, you know, like at least like that\u2019s what my girlfriend will tell you.\r\n\r\nAw. *Laughs*But do you feel it?\r\n\r\nYeah, no-\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\n I think it's real-\r\n\r\nWhy? How so?\r\n\r\nI feel like you just, you know, you you\u2019re, maybe it's one of those things that will reset once we\u2019re out of BUD/S, but, you know, you\u2019re just so like, you know, kind of used to being like able to compartmentalize things and just kind of like zone out a little bit. I think, uh, uh, I think that might\u2019ve transferred over a little bit, to, to like, you know, like my personal emotions.\r\n\r\nWhat else, is there anything else that you can think of that I should be asking about, what makes the difference, might help you or hurt you?\r\n\r\nYeah, I, I guess, kinda to that extent, I think being able to kinda like compartmentalize things, um kinda zone out a little bit, um, definitely like uh you know, it it\u2019s something that I find myself doing a hundred things also, but like, you know, Master Chief Matt Nourachi kind of like talked about like going to a different place during like surf torture or whatever, um, definitely was something that, that worked, worked well for me...I think also like just generally being like, a little bit older, and recognizing that like, you know, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and like, you know it\u2019s uh, you can, you have a little bit more perspective so you can, its easier to kind of put your head down and grind when you know like okay like this is you know, this isn\u2019t gonna last forever.\r\n\r\nAwesome. Alright, really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nYeah, thank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\nIt is awesome, this is super, super helpful.\r\n\r\nAlrighty.\r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nAwesome.\r\n\r\nAlright, thanks a lot, turn this off.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: ENS Daniel Williams\r\n\r\nDate: 17AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 5\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:38\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Raver-Luning\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, is it ok if I record this interview?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is your participant ID?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFive, great.

I, I actually, um, stopped playing baseball, got out of college, um, moved to a different state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, and then, kind of was just doing oddball jobs, and then decided that I needed to do something with my life. And, decided to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas kind of just random.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it wasn't like a lifelong (unintelligible)-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I, I didn't even really know...I knew about Navy SEALs, but I didn't know anything more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew they existed. And uh, just decided to, just do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok. I'll ask you more about your family in just a second. About, tell me a little bit about your personality. Um, what's it like and how do you think it contributed to getting through BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, so for me personally, I don't really take things too seriously. I think, just, having fun, helped me get through this. Um, I mean, I know some people are pretty, pretty serious when it comes to doing this. But I just couldn't be serious about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Had to have fun. Joke around. Um.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think that\u2019s the demeanor of most people? Or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, yeah, I\u2019d say at least half of the guys are pretty, laid back, and have fun with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um,  describe what kind of, a little bit about your family background. I mean, military family at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, so my grand-my grandpa was in the Air Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, but, I mean, that didn't really have any, you know, impact on me joining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean my dad wasn't in the military. Um, just, just kind of, randomly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.  so, um, any friends\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, um, I never even thought I would ever join the military. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn't something I ever thought I would do. Yeah, I don't have any friends that, um, close friends at least, that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat year was it when you were like ok, that's what I'm gonna do? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, probably, I want to say, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you join right away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, so I kind of researched it a little bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I knew I had to like, I already kind of, you know, worked out a lot. Didn't swim hard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew how to swim, cause I grew up in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWent to the beach, but I didn't know how to, you know, swim for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Or anything like that. Um, I trained for a little bit, maybe a few months, and then just, um, went ahead, went ahead and enlisted. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUh, where did you grow up in California?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, Orange County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo like, Anaheim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Unintelligible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, what about your parent\u2019s parenting style? Were they strict? Were they disciplined?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, so my mom pretty strict, my dad, not so much. Uh, I mean, I went to like a, I went to a private christian school, growing up, for a few years. Um, but other than that, it wasn't like super crazy, but I would say my mom was on the stricter side.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. it's interesting. Moms seem like they\u2019re the strict ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I'm like, I think I'm the stricter one in our house too. (Laughter) Don't know what that means. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SIO: But, Um, so, any like discipline, what did, were you put on time outs? Were you spanked? Like what was the (unintelligible) discipline? \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nUm, I remember, she would, she would take things away, not let me go do things with friends, and um stuff like that. Um, maybe as a young child maybe I got spanked or something.  \r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing too like\u2026 stands out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, no, no, nothing really, too crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok. what about, um, did you move at all during your childhood years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I, uh, lived in the same house, uh,  pretty much my whole life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, what about your teenage years? Sports that you played, tell me a little about high school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaseball, football. My dad was always there to help me with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, How do you think being part of, kind of, those types of communities contributed to your experience here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I think it helped a lot. Um, cause there are some guys that I know that are in this program or were in this program that uh, didn't really play sports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it was a little bit harder for them to, like, adjust to that type of uh, atmosphere, in terms of the team, and not being selfish, I guess. So, I think that helped a lot. Knowing that, you know, everyone\u2019s got to do something, to help, you know, make this work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSIO: Um, what about in the last five years of your life? So, you went to college. So, Where did you go to college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Uh, I went to a few different colleges. I got a scholarship to play baseball at Northwest Missouri State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, went there for a year. I played, didn't really like it. Kind of boring out there, and then moved back, went to (unintelligible, maybe general?) college, and then, following, I went to a school in California,  Cal State Dominguez Hills.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, and then I actually, just stopped playing baseball, was kind of just over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind of like, thought it was a dead end. And then uh, actually moved to uh, San Antonio Um, kind of just up and left. It wasn't really planned either. Kind of just, just kind of went out. I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you, so did you finish college here? and? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, no. I actually didn't finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI, I have uh, just an associates degree. That's all I have.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Ok, and then what did you do in San Antonio?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI uh, well, actually my wife, uh, her family moved out there a few years before we did.\r\n\r\n\u2018Cause her dad was born there, and then moved to california when he was younger. And then ended up moving back because he got a good job out there. Uh, I actually met my wife in middle school. Um, dated in high school, stayed together in college, and then we ended up moving out there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when did you guys get married? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, 2018\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas that before you joined the military?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Year before. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny kids?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, is she here, in San Diego? Or is she still in San Antonio?   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, Not yet. She\u2019s, she\u2019s um, planning on moving out here in the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust waiting for her job to open up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. what about um,  and so then, I\u2019m sorry if I asked this. I guess (unintelligible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, it\u2019s all good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour brain starts to go-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA little fuzzy. Um, when did you join the military?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, september sometime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then bootcamp and straight here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I uh, I actually got rolled in Prep. So I, um, went to boot camp, went to prep, got rolled two classes because of a calf injury. And then came out here with 3-8, um made it all the way to 3rd phase and then got rolled. And am here now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did that, getting rolled in prep, do you think that impacted you? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pretty, pretty, pretty horrible. I just, it was like, I didn't enjoy myself out there, nobody really does. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's pretty boring. Just got trapped. Um, but I think it helped me mentally, just going through hard things. Um, helps out a lot (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh sometimes. Not in, not in all aspects, but in some, some things I guess. Um, just depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Yeah. what um, what would be an example of impulsive behavior for you? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Doing this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I've always wanted to just, to do something with my life, you know? I felt like I wasn't really doing anything, um, I don't know, I just, I didn't want to live and die and there be no you know, nothing good to say about me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr just, stuff like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, any tattoos? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo tattoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr anything like that? Any bunch of speeding tickets? Or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I\u2019ve only gotten one ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? (Holistic question) (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, probably being away from my wife. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was one of them. And um, Other than that, I mean, it\u2019s hard, but I mean, I feel like I was able to handle it pretty well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, what about with your wife? I mean, how did that kind of, did, was she, did you see her as a support system as you went through this? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, yes, no, definitely. She, she definitely helped me out a lot. Um, say, I've known her for so long, she\u2019s always been around, and um, just being away, you know, was kind of tough. I've only seen here a handful of times in the last year. Yeah, she definitely helped me a lot. Cause, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated you to get through?  Did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, I would say a few different things,  um, especially going into hell week. Uh, Definitely could not call my wife and tell her I quit, so I just wasn't going to do that. And then my, i would say my dad. There was no way I could, you know, let him down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould he have been let down?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. he, it would have probably just let me down, you know, thinking that, I have this weird thing where I just want to, you know, make him proud, and i know no matter what I do, even if I didn't make it, he would have still been proud, um, just, I don't, I  couldn't ever see any quitting, having my helmet down on the grinder with his last name on there, just not, not something I would be able to do, honestly. I've never understood, I guess, I know why people quit but I just don't know how they do it. I couldn't bring myself to do it. So it's just a weird, weird thing.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: were there any  practices  you utilized to get through this? Like Spiritual, mental, physical?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, not really. Um, but I would say almost all of it is mental. Um, anyone can, can train and get to where they need to be, physically, to pass all the, you know, evolutions and whatnot. But it really comes down to either you want to do this or you don't. That's really all it is. I think a lot of people seem to forget, you know, being a SEAL isn't, you know, boats and logs and hell week, its, um, not that forever, there's an end to all of it, and then, you know, you start doing stuff that you'll end up using in the job.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Was there any time where you had to make a difficult decision at BUD/S, um, whether it was an ethical or moral decision personally, or you watched somebody maybe cut a corner and you had to make a decision about what to do about it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, no I never really ran into that, um, and I'm not really sure what I would do, like, you know, just depending on the situation. Um, I\u2019m not sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I think it's just as simple as, just wanting to do it, not quitting. Just, that's really all it is. Just want to be, better I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever had that attitude about anything else in your life? Like (Unintelligible)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, baseball for sure. I really worked really hard. Um, a lot harder than, you know, especially in high school, um, guys would go home and I would stay after and hit and do whatever. Just wanting to be the best, even though I know I wasn\u2019t. Someone is always better than you. Um, you gotta have that, that attitude. So.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Anything different that you noticed about the people that made it through BUD/S, and the people that quit specifically?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, well I know, it's weird, cause there's guys that are physically a lot, you know, more made out for this, and that don't make it. Um, I think a lot of it has to do with, you know, a lot of us are, are not, you know, the best at uh, you know, certain things, and we know failure and we\u2019re able to accept that, and basically move on and want, you know, to be the best. And, like a lot of people that are, are good at certain things, almost everything, they're not used to that failure and they just don't know how to handle it. They've always been, you know, good at everything they do. So.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How does this experience change you as a person, if at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Um, I feel like I'm somewhat the same person. Um, probably would say, wouldn't say carefree, but just feel like before, growing up I was pretty, I would say I was a pretty good kid, didn't get into any trouble really. Uh, Didn't even drink until after i was 21. I just feel like I am a little more relaxed, because I was maybe more uptight growing up. Just trying to like, I had my head on straight, with school and baseball, um, I would just say that I'm a little more, like, yeah, laid back pretty much. Just kinda\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything that I didn't ask that you think would be important for us to know?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, no, I feel like everything was, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel like we covered it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah you got it all.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell I appreciate you taking the time, thank you. Congratulations  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "Jack Sylvester:\r\n\r\nDate: 16AUG\r\n\r\nParticipant #10/3049: \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 12:45\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm Yep and I\u2019ll hit Record here. And then Uh Do I have your permission to Record\r\n\r\nOf Course\r\n\r\nOk and can you tell me participant ID numbers and why you have two of them there?\r\n\r\nUm the first one is 10 and second one is 3049 that\u2019s because I got rolled out of a previous class.\r\n\r\nOk and when did you start your BUD/S Class? Your First BUD/S Class?\r\n\r\nJune 10th 2019.\r\n\r\nAnd is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUm so let\u2019s talk about your family uh are you\u2026do you have siblings?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m one of five.\r\n\r\nOk and can you tell me where you fall in the birth order and if its brothers and sisters?\r\n\r\nMy oldest is an older brother and then there\u2019s me and then a younger sister, younger brother, younger sister.\r\n\r\nBig Family?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nThese are all one set of parents..?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\u2026No stepsisters or brothers. Were your parents married?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nOk and uh how long have they been married?\r\n\r\n[pause]\u2026twenty years\u2026\r\n\r\nHow\u2019s your relationship with them?\r\n\r\nGreat, I\u2019m really close with both of them.\r\n\r\nAnd relationship with your siblings?\r\n\r\nReally close with them as well.\r\n\r\nOk good, any life changing events that happened prior to coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm my senior year of High School, my best friend killed himself. Umm other than that no.\r\n\r\nIm sorry.\r\n\r\nIts ok.\r\n\r\nThat sounds really hard. Um do you think that factors into your experience at BUD/S? How often do you think about him?\r\n\r\nUm I mean I definitely think about him for sure\u2026.um\u2026.it definitely keeps me going in the mindset of like I don\u2019t wanna grow up and not be anything I wanna be a good man like he was so\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026I look up to him because he was a really great guy and so\u2026.I don\u2019t wanna go down a rabbit hole and not be anything with my life.\r\n\r\nSo you feel this obligation to honor his legacy?\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nOk\u2026.What was his name?\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression after BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think it worked out pretty well because\u2026Im not much of a downer so it worked out.\r\n\r\nSo you have a overall positive mental\u2026\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nAttitude. Ok anything else in terms of\u2026?\r\n\r\nI just don\u2019t want to quit [laughs] I don\u2019t know\r\n\r\nOk so you have a tenacity?\r\n\r\nYes. Headstrong.\r\n\r\nDescribe your background that lead you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community. So do you have any SEALs that are family of friends?\r\n\r\nNo no. I don\u2019t know anyone in the teams other than the instructors that are here.\r\n\r\nAnyone in your family military at all?\r\n\r\nMy brother joined just before I did to go to the Air Force to be in the Military Police. Other than that no. We were the first two.\r\n\r\nSo what gave you the idea?\r\n\r\nUm growing my dad had always talked about how he wished he would have joined because it would have set him up for his life for his family and so that was my idea. I wanted to join so I had a good base to start off of.\r\n\r\nSo he encouraged to join the military in general?\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nSo why SEALs?\r\n\r\nUm they offered it to me at MEPS and I went with it.\r\n\r\nAnd you thought why not?\r\n\r\nPretty much yeah.\r\n\r\nSo lets some more about your childhood and how you were disciplined, so what was your parents parenting style?\r\n\r\nI had very, very good parents, they were strict but they also let me learn. So like [pause] anytime anything happened they were like ok if you\u2019re going to do that its going to suck. Like\u2026that\u2019s how it was. Um very, very good parenting.\r\n\r\nWere you spanked when you were younger?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAnd as you get older how was the discipline? Was it like take away your video games or take away your phone?\r\n\r\nTake away phone and car and [pause]\r\n\r\nPrivileges?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBut there was also this sort of go out and make mistakes in a sort of safe environment\u2026\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\n ..and learn from it?\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nDid you move around during your childhood?\r\n\r\nNo. I moved like three different house but it was all\u2026\r\n\r\nSame Area?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nSo you didn\u2019t have to move schools..\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\u2026or friend groups?\r\n\r\nNo. Same school entire childhood.\r\n\r\nAnd then in your teenage years did you do sports or activities?\r\n\r\nYes. I played football, ran cross country, um wrestled and played baseball.\r\n\r\nA lot sports.\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAny\u2026what would you say was your dominant sport?\r\n\r\nWrestling for sure.\r\n\r\nHow many years?\r\n\r\nUm 3\r\n\r\nAnd then in the five years before BUD/S can you tell me what you were doing?\r\n\r\nGoing to high school and working.\r\n\r\nWhat were you working?\r\n\r\nUmmm landscaping.\r\n\r\nOk. Like out in the projects?\r\n\r\nNo we had our\u2026its\u2026called Pawn Pro Shop, its like professional built ponds like we would go to people\u2019s backyards and build a pond swan. And I ran, we had 14 different ponds and with all sorts of different koi fish and stuff like that inside of them. And I just ran the entire yard and kept it clean and pretty.\r\n\r\nWell\u2026any college?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nAnd then you\u2026what was the inspiration to then enlist. Your dad said military service would be a good opportunity?\r\n\r\nHe talks about it would be a good way to start out your life, like a good base, to start off of and so I ran with it.\r\n\r\nOk, would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nNo, for the most part I think things over before I do it.\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos that you got on a whim?\r\n\r\nI have one tattoo but that was because my buddy John died. That was in memory of him, so I guess that was a little bit impulsive. But that\u2019s the only thing.\r\n\r\nYeah but you didn\u2019t have some drinks and then\u2026\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nSpeeding tickets?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nUh\u2026uh\u2026big purchases. You see a car and you want to buy it?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S? So it could have been a day, an event. Could have been a theme like water or logs?\r\n\r\nUm for me it was the pressure chamber. I just had a hard time clearing my ears.\r\n\r\nSo it was physically uncomfortable?\r\n\r\nYeah\u2026physically, trying, they just wouldn\u2019t clear. That\u2019s what I got rolled for. Just couldn\u2019t clear my ears.\r\n\r\nSo how was that experience of getting rolled? Was that challenging? Sort of having to realize you were going to have to redo some of the\u2026?\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really have to redo anything and it was kind of nice, because I got a break and time to heal and then just trying to get ready to go back into it\u2026 so it worked out for me.\r\n\r\nSo that doesn\u2019t really sound like a challenge\u2026I mean your thing\u2026what was really hard for you?\r\n\r\nI just literally couldn\u2019t clear my ears that was the only hard thing.\r\n\r\nIn the whole experience of BUD/S, that\u2019s it?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it.\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nYeah, I didn\u2019t really have a problem with anything else.\r\n\r\nOk, what motivates you? What gets you through hard things? When things are challenging?\r\n\r\n[Pause] I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want to quit. I was raised right and then like [pause] I feel like I have a good family name back home, like a lot of people know my dad, and my dad\u2019s dad and all that. I don\u2019t want to disrespect the name.\r\n\r\nOk. Do you have a practice? Like a physical, mental, or spiritual thing that you use to push through challenges? So some guys talk about prayer or mantra or like meditation or like visualization exercise? Do you do anything like that.\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nSo you just show up and perform?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it [both laugh] Simple dude.\r\n\r\nWhat are you thinking about when you\u2019re under the log or in the boat, you know the grind?\r\n\r\nJust thinking about my share of the weight so nobody else does.\r\n\r\nWhen you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind when you made that decision? Can you give me an example of a decision that you really struggled with? For example running classmates out?\r\n\r\nUm one of the hard ones is during PREP I got close with a guy that I came out here with and I ended up having to run him out of the boat because he just wasn\u2019t carrying his weight, he was dragging everyone else down. He was just a liability at that point. So it was rough but after 2 days of it I had enough, so I just told everyone I\u2019m don\u2019t and [sic] and I ran him out twice.\r\n\r\nSo whyd you make that decision?\r\n\r\nBecause I was looking around and I knew how my body felt and I knew it wasn\u2019t just because the circumstances, this was hell week, I knew that he was dragging the boat down he was not carrying his weight he was just hurting the other guys from the boat crew.\r\n\r\nSo you did what was best for the boat crew?\r\n\r\nYeah and it sucked because I knew him, good dude.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful at BUD/S\r\n\r\nJust do what the instructors say, then it won\u2019t be as bad.\r\n\r\nOk what did you notice about guys that did make it?\r\n\r\nGood group of dudes, good attitude. They know whats right and whats wrong and don\u2019t quit. Everybody else that end up not making it, the turds, they try to get away with stuff and cheat through, nobody here does that. Good group of dudes.\r\n\r\nDo you think this experience has changed you?\r\n\r\nI think so. It definitely makes me appreciate more things.\r\n\r\nAnything else that I didn\u2019t ask that you think would be insightful for us? Trying to figure out what makes a successful candidate.\r\n\r\nI feel like a lot of it has to do with childhood and how they were raised. Cause if you were raised in a really shitty situation\u2026you\u2026you\u2026theres nothing to fall back on. And whenever I look back I have my family name that I want to live up to. Um I just want to make a good imprint on that name. I got a great family behind me if I ever need them. I don\u2019t ever\u2026I would never want to tell my dad, hey I failed, I didn\u2019t make it. And so if you don\u2019t have somebody to look back, look up to like that then I can see how it would be hard for them.\r\n\r\nOk great.

And what life changing means is anything you think it means, it could be nothing it could be ya had one thing it could be ya had three things?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I don\u2019t know.  I wouldn\u2019t say I had any like major events that were super life changing it was more of uh just kind of a gradual \u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: shift in who I developed to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Great, uhm. How do you think your personality contributed to your success in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, I think, helped me just like more of a serious guy, uhm kept things professional when I need to, but I was just kinda able to keep some perspective and laugh about things at times. It kinda worked as a balance for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then tell me about your background that even wanted, that made you wanna be a SEAL. Like did you have anybody that you knew that was a seal? Was your family military?

I, I had like that idea of military, like some special operations, wasn\u2019t sure. And he just kinda put a face to it and then that just slowly developed while I was in college. And then afterwards, uhm, decided to come out here and pursue this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, so tell me about, a little bit about your childhood like how were you disciplined? Like did your parents spank you, make you run, or do pushups or withhold toys or timeouts? What?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah the, the, or they\u2019re biggest way would be to just take things away from us...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Or just kinda, I, I was I wasn\u2019t a super rebellious kid by any means.

(laughs) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And did you move around in, in college or in high school? Sorry, ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: In your teenage years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No, I grew up in New Jersey and stayed there all the way through college, so comin\u2019 out here was the first time I left. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow, okay. And then tell me about your teenage years. Did you ha, were you on a team sport in...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: high school, college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah so I played soccer in high scool and college. So, basically grew up playing sports and was always, always playin\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what position do you play in soccer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Changed a lot, I ended as a forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, that\u2019s where like I finished played, but played defense my first couple years so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Were you recruited?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, yes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I\u2019m just interested my son plays soccer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So (laughing) It\u2019s definitely all consuming.

So they\u2019re way ahead in the premier league, but that\u2019s way off track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah (laughing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So sorry (laughing). So, what have you done in the last five years of your life prior to BUD/S? Just went to college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I was in ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: or did you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, so I was in college and then put in the uh officer candidate school package. So that is like a year long process in itself to come out here. There\u2019s a screener, so after college I put in my application and I coached for a year while I was going through this process to come out here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: At what level?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, it was a youth club, so we were, we had teams between like U-10 and U-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, would you consider yourself impulsive? Like, do you have any tattoos or do you make?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Definitely not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. And then what? Think about the most challenging day that you\u2019ve had at BUD/S or your hardest thing? What motivated you to push through and did you feel like you were supported by your team?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Definitely supported by the team. Uhm, everybody\u2019s gonna have their, their days. I wouldn\u2019t say one that stands out to me too much, but just like I, I have a lot of memories and just like the guys keeping you like in your perspective and just realizing where you are and being lucky to have such great people around you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what was the hardest day? Or what are you thinking of? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Like Hell Week?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, Hell Week\u2019s just, just a grind. There\u2019s nothing that stands out as like this one thing was impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: But you just have your, your moments that are just like you just kinda get through em.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And what practices did you have to help your push through the challenges? Like emotional, spiritual, mental? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you, can you think of anything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: It was just, just like a men, a mentality to just keep going knowing that everything is going to end eventually. Uhm, definitely seeing like just going through whatever we\u2019re doing just take care of that one step at a time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s helpful. So did you have any difficult decisions that you had to make at BUD/S? Like, uhm, running classmates out, turning in someone who\u2019s cheating? And if you did, what does, did you struggle with that and what helped you get over that? And if you didn\u2019t that\u2019s fine too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah we definitely had a couple decisions like that. Uh, in terms of class leadership amongst the officers and the senior enlisted guys we have. Uhm, and they always turned into, it wasn\u2019t just me making the decision or just our OIC making the decision it was always like a group discussion about it, uhm, amongst those that have the leadership roles and we always talked it through, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Can you give me an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, so one example is just a guy breaking curfew on our first weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Like going out drinking and comes back and he\u2019s, he\u2019s the only guy that comes back late. So, talked about it with the class to decide are you gonna turn him into the staff or are you gonna handle it within the class. I\u2019ve had a few, a few things like that come up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yep, no, sure. Uhm, What did you think about specifically when you made that decision? I\u2019m not talking about the group, I\u2019m talking about you personally, like, did you think about, uhm, what that would do to him? The consequences or did you think about you as a team?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, you definitely have to. We thought about both fors, uh, I thought about both forsure. Cause if, if you turn this one guy in it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re gonna put him in a really bad spot where if he has a history of other mistakes he\u2019s gonna get dropped from the program likely. So, you definitely take that into consideration. But, uhm, what we kind of saw as the more important thing is what, what the rest of the class is doing and the guys who are doing the right thing. You need to be able to stand up for the guys who are gonna do the right thing and, and get rid of the people who are gonna be toxic to the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, (laughing), I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a tough question. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well let me ask it this way, what do you think is different about the people who didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: (Unintelligible)I don\u2019t know, maybe they just lost sight of what they were here for. Uhm. Personally, like it was, it was a huge decision for me to come out here and like my decision was made before I was out here, so. It (unintelligible), it\u2019s just kinda like a simple way of explaining it, but that was really just how I felt about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm. How do you think this whole decision changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Like to come out here or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: The BUD/S experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: It\u2019s definitely given me great perspective on different people, uhm. Just, a lot of different experiences that you go through. I think the, one of the bigger lessons that I\u2019ve learned though is to just, you never know who, who you\u2019re dealing with and kind of the deeper levels of, of people and getting to know them better and giving guys a second chance and being surprised who they, who they are who you thought they were. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So the Army, er the Army, I\u2019m Army, the Navy has asked us to come in and do this to try to figure out before people get here what makes someone successful at BUD/s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Interviewer: Is there anything that I shoulda asked you that would help us in this research endeavor? No?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I don\u2019t know (Laughing). I guess that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing this today, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: (Laughing) kay. Well sometimes, yeah, sometimes people will say yeah well I\u2019ve noticed ya know that all the impulsive people quit or whatever. Is there anything you think we missed and that we should\u2019ve asked? Like, oh if you ask this question that\u2019ll separate the people who make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No. I, I\u2019ve just tried, I\u2019ve just kinda realized that I have no idea who\u2019s, who\u2019s gonna be, you never know who\u2019s not gonna make it, but I think there are some guys that just you can probably bet on by being like well-thought out and like, yeah I guess less impulsive (unintelligible) the guys that had to invest a lot more to get out here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: That seems to be, uh, the ones who are just still here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay thank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Ryan Herrera-Murphy\r\n\r\nDate: 17AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 38\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 14:16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That I interview you with the recorder on?\r\n\r\nParticipant: yes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: and what's your number\r\n\r\nParticipant: 38\r\n\r\nInterviewer:38 okay great so when did you start buds and is this your first BUDS experience? \r\n\r\nParticipant: it is my first BUDS experience\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So did you start with 339? \r\n\r\nParticipant: i started with 337 \r\n\r\nInterviewer:337 so you started in december? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: i started in april of 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay and how many siblings do you have older brother older sister younger ? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:i have 5 siblings um 3 older sister one younger sister and one younger brother \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay were your parents married separated divorced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: married\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: alright and then what was your relationship with them ? \r\n\r\nParticipant: close\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: close are there any life changing events that happened to you prior to coming to BUDS some people say no and some people give me 5 things its whatever you think is life changing \r\n\r\nParticipant: yes um yes \r\n\r\nInterviewer: can you share do you mind\r\n\r\nParticipant:um yeah i was working a steady job a job i didn't like i always knew i wanted to join the military \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: mhm \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:um my life wasn't really going anywhere i found myself in jail one night for something i didn't do but either way i was in jail and i just thought i wasn't really doing anything with my life and i decided i wanted to join the military\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: um so that experience factored into your experience at BUDs cause it really led you to BUDS right or led you to join the navy? \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipant: led me to join the navy yes a long time ago growing up it was a dream  to come here to buds \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay \r\n\r\nParticipant: yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay i'm going to ask you more about that dont worry but how do you think your personality has contributed to your success \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: uh take everything you know i dunno the hard im a very happy guy positive guy i try to look at the brightside\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay \r\n\r\nParticipant: i guess that would help\r\n\r\nInterviewer: yeah absolutely so tell me about your background you said you wanted to join the navy even in highschool and become a seal  what how did you even know about the seals  like did you have a military family did you watch a movie did you play video games\r\n\r\nParticipant: no military family umm it was always a desire to serve my country \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: but how did you have that desire cause not everyone has that \r\n\r\nParticipant: yes yeah i just had that desire i like serving i guess as i remember thinking im very athletic i am very patriotic i've always liked american and serving my country is something i've always wanted to do so i guess i knew i was going to join the military eventually\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay so tell me a little bit about your childhood.

Uhhhh anytime there was something that I knew was gonna be hard or challenging, I would just pray and also pray for my buddies going through it. And I think first time, every time is a thing and I know second time or third I\u2019m just like please help me. And please help my buddies who are going through the same thing, so yeah it was spiritual in that sense.\r\n\r\nI: yeah, what do you think, if there was a difficult decision you had to make here at BUD/S, can you talk to me about that decision a little bit and what went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\nP: I don\u2019t think there really was a difficult decision, it was kinda like, its very simple and it\u2019s just once you realize that it\u2019s simple, everything else difficult about it goes out the window.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, so so, what makes it simple?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I\u2019ve had this discussion before and that\u2019s like an hour long discussion\u2026\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, we don\u2019t need to get into it.\r\n\r\nP: Yeah *laughs*\r\n\r\nI: But is there like, is it just not overthinking or? \r\n\r\nP: Yeah, I would definitely say it\u2019s just not overthinking anything. Every, a lot of the guys problems is they overthink it, but it like, it gets them to the point where it\u2019s just like they can\u2019t handle it and they\u2019ll talk about it at night or something like that and you\u2019re just like \u201ccalm down, take a breath\u201d and it comes down to just simply breathe and like don\u2019t overthink it.\r\n\r\nI: So why do you think you were successful?\r\n\r\nP: Why??\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, at BUD/S.\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, because I was calm and just breathed.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: Like going back to like, I guess I gotta credit Master Chief Barachi with this...uhhh\u2026 he would teach us stuff like hey, just get mad and step back from it all\r\n\r\nI: yeah\r\n\r\nP: Just one second even \r\n\r\nI: *mic scuffled* It\u2019s loud (unsure)\r\n\r\nP: Just take one second step back and then you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s not that bad and it\u2019s not that hard and it\u2019s not that complicated and then you\u2019re just like wow okay I can do this.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, do you notice anything different between the people that made it through BUD/S and the people that didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nP: I mean, before, from first phase, yes and then from there on, no. Every guy was kinda the same they just had their hiccups.\r\n\r\nI: What was the different in first phase for those that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\nP: Probably just mindset.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026\r\n\r\nP: Like you\u2019d see guys like just overthinking everything or just even how they acted or anything like that.

Uhm, I think a big life changing event for me was when one of my good friends in high school died in a car accident. That definitely made me a more religious person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How did that experience factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUhm, I don\u2019t know, I just started, uh like going to church more and more like faith, you know I guess I took that into BUD/S and like  (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think it was good because I would take everything like not too seriously like joking around a lot. \r\n\r\nSo you don\u2019t take things too seriously?\r\n\r\nYeah, like, have fun with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community.

Uhm, I\u2019d say my what my dad stressed a lot was being tough all the time. Like never complain, never quit anything.

Did you participate in a team sport? \r\n\r\nYeah I did, uh wrestled, played football, soccer. \r\n\r\nThose were the three?\r\n\r\nYep, those were the three. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last 5 years of your life prior to starting at BUD/S? \r\n\r\nUhm, what do you mean like uh like I was in college. \r\n\r\nCollege?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\nSo as soon as you got out of college you enlisted?\r\n\r\nYes, I went right out of my college house. \r\n\r\nWhat was your degree in? \r\n\r\nCriminology\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the same sort of track I took. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Would you consider yourself impulsive?  \r\n\r\nUh, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think so. \r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Or your hardest, hardest day or hardest event?\r\n\r\nHardest day? Okay, so um it was my first attempt at OC 8.\r\n\r\nThe what? \r\n\r\nOC 8, the pool comp, and I blacked out underwater, and I got pulled out on a stretcher and stuff then they were like \u2018alright, your second attempt is tomorrow.\u2019 so I just go in the next day like after that kind of like traumatic experience, so it was tough like calming my nerves after that. \r\n\r\nSo you, how...what caused you to black out?\r\n\r\nDidn\u2019t have any air. I had a knot and couldn\u2019t get it undone and um I like flipped it off my back and started working on it just was like taking to long and started convulsing and took in water and I was out and next time I woke up I was just on a little stretcher on the side of the pool and they were slapping my face. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, What motivated to push through after that?\r\n\r\nIt was honestly just cause I wanted to be with the boys. I didn\u2019t want to get pulled like all my friends were in 38 so I was just like I got to pass this \r\n\r\nDid you feel support from the group?\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah no everybody wanted to pass so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What um, in general, What practices (physical, mental, spiritual) did you utilize to push through or get through the challenges?\r\n\r\nChallenges? Uh, I just would get in my head and say that God\u2019s got me no matter what, then I just pushed the worry away and I don\u2019t really think much about it. s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind, uh,  as you made that decision? What decision did you really struggle with? Uhm the example is uh, they have here is running classmates out, uh or turning in a cheating classmate. \r\n\r\nUhm, I can\u2019t think of a specific time, but I know when I\u2019ve had to make tough decisions, I usually just go with my gut, because I trust my gut. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing this?\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s because I really didn\u2019t have, I didn\u2019t really have the option of quitting or failing because all my friends and family have already made it so it was like I didn\u2019t want to be that guy who would be a disgrace to all of them. I was perfectly fine with dying out there if I had to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those that did not make it? \r\n\r\nI think the guys who did not make it would get worried about all the little things and not think of like big picture. There\u2019s a lot of guys who would be like super before a swimmer inspection or something which is so small, you just do like push ups or something if you fail and like there\u2019s no time...there\u2019s no need to stress over that. \r\n\r\nAnything else?\r\n\r\nUhm, I don\u2019t know, I wouldn\u2019t even say it doesn\u2019t really matter what shape you\u2019re in to get to this point and obviously i\u2019m in the shape to make it through I would say just worrying too much. And not having fun with it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience, going through the program,  change you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhm, I think it definitely made me a better person just because I learned how to deal with failure all the time. \r\n\r\nTo deal with what?\r\n\r\nDeal with failure. Taking it, learning it, and moving on. I think that\u2019s a great skill people can have. It also made me realize like you\u2019re not going to be good at everything the first time you try it. But you always have to at least try. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I should have asked you, but didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nProbably not, that was good. \r\n\r\nGreat. \r\n\r\nAlright, thank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jake Rude\r\n\r\nDate: \r\n\r\nParticipant #: 53\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI: How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nP: I have two brothers.\r\n\r\nI: Two brothers.

You just have to go through the event. Did that kind of help?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah, I\u2019m pretty good at losing, like I deal with it pretty well. I\u2019m not super competitive which is I guess is kind of rare for this program, but I think sometimes its the really competitive guys, like when they can\u2019t do something, it really breaks them down, where I\u2019ve already kind of, I\u2019m used to that stuff, so I didn\u2019t really get phased too much.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, what about, could you tell me a little bit about your personality and how that kind of contributed to you going through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I like to make friends\u2026 uhm I treat everyone usually like like noone\u2019s better than me at least I don\u2019t think so, uhm and noones like worse than me either\u2026 uhm, but yeah just kind of treat everyone as nice as possible whether they\u2019re like a custodian or like a CEO I guess\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: So everything in between is kind of all the same to me.\r\n\r\nI: So, uhm, you kind of talked about it a little bit, but uhm I want to go in a little background about your childhood, so what about your background kind of lead you to want to become part of the SEAL community?\r\n\r\nP: I would play like guns a lot when I was a kid and I just always thought it was cool\u2026 yeah uhm basically I just saw like a lot of war movies and stuff and I was always just into it.

I feel like I almost wasted time, but it is what it is, I am here now, so I am pretty excited about it. Definitely don\u2019t regret it at all, so I am really excited now.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, do you think you would\u2019ve been as successful if you would\u2019ve done it sooner?\r\n\r\nP: I\u2019m not too sure, part of me thinks I would\u2019ve been fine just cause like no ones really, not really a matter of whether you\u2019re a physical specimen or not, but I think, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it hurt having some more life experience.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, uhm, what about, uhh, do you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\nP: In what..?\r\n\r\nI: Impulsive.\r\n\r\nP: yeah, I don\u2019t really like to make plans, I definitely like to just kind of do something now or not really, I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\nI: What might be some impulsive behaviors that you say you have?\r\n\r\nP: Uhh\u2026 like uhh\u2026 yesterday I was done watching a movie and I was gonna go back and go to sleep, but my friend called me and asked me to go to a bar and I was thinking about not going and then I was like ehh, I guess I\u2019ll go. Ended up doing that, I don\u2019t know if someone asks me to do something and I think it sounds fun at the moment, I\u2019ll probably definitely do it.\r\n\r\nI: Any tattoos\u2026 I know that seems like a strange question?\r\n\r\nP: No, I don\u2019t have any tattoos.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, speeding tickets\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: I got one speeding ticket like two years ago, but I don\u2019t know I definitely drive quicker, but I definitely, I\u2019m not like a maniac, but\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: Uhm, what motivates you  on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, not wasting my life I guess.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: Not getting complacent like I hated working my 9-5 job.

Uhhh, yeah I didn\u2019t really think too far in the future.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 \r\n\r\nP: But I just thought about what if I quit, it would probably be like I quit and then five minutes later I\u2019d see the class running somewhere else, doing something that like...uhm, like that I would be kicking myself for quitting because I definitely could have made it just five more minutes or whatever, uhm\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: Were there every anytimes that you wanted to quit? Like seriously actually considered it?\r\n\r\nP: Uhh, never actually seriously, I always thought about like what if I were to quit right now, what would my life be like?

I kind of experienced enough where I know mechanical engineering wasn\u2019t really what I saw myself doing for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nI: yeah\u2026 \r\n\r\nP: And that was definitely enough to be like, \u201cI definitely want to put everything into this.\u201d But other than that, I don\u2019t really, I\u2019m not like super patriotic or super religious or anything like that. I just thought the job sounded awesome. I mean I do thinks its cool like killing bad guys and what not, people that are dirtbags, but uhh \r\n\r\nI: Uhm, do you feel there was support in the group, like was there group support in your class or was it more kind of individual?\r\n\r\nP: I became friends with a lot of guys and I definitely like, we had some pretty funny moments, but uhh, yeah definitely definitely feed off each other as support, but uhh, I didn\u2019t really have any real close, I wasn\u2019t really too close where like if my friend quit like one of my friends, I had a few friends quit and it didn\u2019t really phase me at all\u2026 like it was just kinda like bummer\u2026\r\n\r\nI: Keep going\u2026\r\n\r\nP: That\u2019s part of the process, you know?\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, were there any specific practices, I mean you said you weren\u2019t really spiritual at all, but are there any specific practices that you used or physical, mental, or spiritual that kind of helped you get through this process?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm\u2026 I did a lot of box breathing before events and what not, but not really like during, uhm, I would definitely tell myself positive things I\u2019d say on the whole like negative thoughts definitely entered my mind, but not enough to like\u2026 just small ones I guess.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 uhm, were there any difficult decisions that you had to make at BUD/S and what went through your mind when you had to make a difficult decision?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I think one of the harder parts was when I, I guess it wasn\u2019t so hard...you\u2026I don\u2019t know, you kind of become animalistic and uhh when we were running boat one time, like I started screaming at other people that I knew were not doing their part.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: Because they were just kind of like leeching off the guys that were really trying and like one kid fell out and it kinked my neck and I started cursing him out, I got all in his face and then he quit, uhm, but I didn\u2019t really feel bad about that because not everyone deserves to be here so\r\n\r\nI: Any kind of ethical or moral type of decisions you had to make?\r\n\r\nP: I don\u2019t really break the rules, just because I was scared of getting dropped, so nothing like that, I never really cheated on anything or\u2026 not in anyway like that.\r\n\r\nI: okay, uhm, why do you think you were successful?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm\u2026. I think it had a lot to do with growing up with like my brother and his friends.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 \r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I don't know, we\u2019d, we\u2019d get in fights and what not, but uhh, I don\u2019t know, sometimes I\u2019d win, so that was kind of funny at least. Uhh, I don\u2019t know, I think it, I don\u2019t know just getting bullied, but like I don\u2019t know, it was harmless bullying, it\u2019s kind of weird to say, but I think that helped a lot.\r\n\r\nI: Kind of shaped you a little bit?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah, yeah it was good.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, did you notice anything different about the people that made it versus the people that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, physically or mentally?\r\n\r\nI: Anything.\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I think sometimes the guys that were really physically fit like just got uhh, whats the word, I don\u2019t know got *short pause* got shaken up by the fact they weren\u2019t performing or something like that.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, where a lot of guys that weren\u2019t always super fit kind of just were used to that sort of thing, uhm, no matter how much they were getting yelled at to perform or what not. They kind of just gutted it out, but, I don\u2019t know, You could definitely just tell like some guys like my one friend who was just staring blankly in a mirror one time and I was like, \u201chey man, you alright?\u201d and he like didn\u2019t even answer me\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 \r\n\r\nP: And I was just like, like he just had like you know you could tell outwardly after like a logs session or what not, he would be like, \u201cman that really sucked\u201d and I would be like laughing kind of and he was just like, he wouldn\u2019t respond or he just would think about how much that sucked. I was like that sucked but thank God we\u2019re doing something else now, like you know it\u2019s behind us now\r\n\r\nI: Moved on to the next thing.\r\n\r\nP: yeah, so, I think that\u2019s a big thing.\r\n\r\nI: Okay well the good thing is this is now done, you\u2019re done with my easy questions compared to *inaudible* \r\n\r\nP: Cool.\r\n\r\nI: Thank you, Congratulations.\r\n\r\nP: Thank you very much\r\n\r\nI: Take care.\r\n\r\nP: Nice to meet you \r\n\r\nI: Great to meet you\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Brad Alexander\r\n\r\nDate: 16 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 58 / 357\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 9:41\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did you start your BUD/S class and is this your first experience? Who did you start with?\r\n\r\n\tMy first BUD/S experience, yes. But, I started with class 337. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you rolled to 338 or did you skip right to 339?\r\n\r\n\tNo, end of 38 and then 39. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n\tOne older sister and one younger sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere your parents married, separated or divorced?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. Married until right before I left for the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you were 18, 19?\r\n\r\n\t18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is your relationship with them?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. me and my mom are super close, me and my dad had a little bit of a rough patch, I guess you could call it, its getting better again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any life changing events prior to BUD/S? Whatever you think is life changing.\r\n\r\n\tUhh\u2026 not really that I could recall. \r\n\r\nWhat about your personality do you think progressed you through BUD/S? What helped you?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. being stubborn, probably. Seems to be a pretty common theme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat made you want to be a SEAL, did you watch a movie, know someone in the military? How did you even know about it?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. I was pretty young, maybe about 8 or 9 and we were at its called a balloon fiesta in Mexico and the leap frogs actually jumped in and landed and I was like that looks super cool and then and my dad taught me about a little bit more of what they actually did and that was just kind of like part of like their shore duty so I learned more from that way and from then on I was pretty set. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your childhood, how did your parents discipline you? Did they give you a time out, did they make you do push ups, did they spank you?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. I got spankings when I was younger and then I guess as I got older they\u2019d take my phone and ground me kind of deal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then did you move a lot as you were growing up?\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen tell me about your teenage years, were you on team sports or were you with a tight knit community with church or boy scouts or...?\r\n\r\n\tI played football and baseball since T-ball since I was super young and then once I got into highschool kind of started to playing around, I did track, and powerlifting, and basketball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere any of those teams like really tight?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. our football team was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what did you do in last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S? Did you finish highschool?\r\n\r\n\tI did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what?\r\n\r\n\tSo I uhm.. Five years ago I was in 8th grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay so after high school you enlisted right away?\r\n\r\n\tYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you enlist for the SEALs?\r\n\r\n\tYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself to be impulsive? Like your decision to join the SEALs have you thought about it a lot or did you just decide to do it?\r\n\r\n\tUhm\u2026 I had thought about it but deep down I had known that is what I wanted to do. I guess kind of a little bit of both I uh, from that day uhh I knew yeah I wanted to try to do it but then I guess I kind of doubted myself along the way some so I uhh thought against it or weighed the options but.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so do you have any tattoos or kind of binge drink or anything like that?\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay so you\u2019re not really impulsive.\r\n\r\nOkay so think about your hardest day at BUD/S? What was that?\r\n\r\n\tUhh\u2026 Probably getting rolled for the second time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat helped you or motivated you through that?\r\n\r\n\tUhh\u2026 Having people that I was pretty close with already get rolled at the same time and just knowing, yeah I am not with my original class or it's another 8 months or 8 weeks that we have to go through training. In the end we're all going to the same bowl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you feel like you were supported by the group when you were going through that hard time?\r\n\r\n\tYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any specific practices you did to help get through those times like meditation or praying or breathing?\r\n\r\n\tIf anything it was just going out with my friends and eating or hanging out at the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any difficult decisions you had to make going through BUD/S? Like turning a classmate for cheating or not doing what he was supposed to do?\r\n\r\nUhh\u2026 No not in our class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\tUhh\u2026 Probably the biggest thing was because I couldn\u2019t call my mom and tell her that I..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love that answer\r\n\r\n\tThat was one of the biggest things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me ask it a different way, did you notice anything different about the people who wound up quitting? What was different between you and them, the people that are here and the people that aren\u2019t?\r\n\r\n\tUhh\u2026 It\u2019s tough cause I still have some friends that have quit and still talk to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh I am not saying they are bad people, I am just trying to figure out \r\n\r\n\tOh no I know, right, but like I don\u2019t know, I feel like with some of the guys that I was friends with before they quit were pretty much the same and had a bunch of the same like backstory and grew up kind of the same but then there is other people that are completely different and made it through. It\u2019s hard to kind of pinpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, how do you think this whole experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\tUhh I definitely matured a lot, especially coming right after high school. It\u2019s made me kind of grow up and open my eyes to the world a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah where are you from? I didn\u2019t ask that\r\n\r\n\tI am from Texas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere in Texas?\r\n\r\n\tSmall town outside of San Antonio. About 45 minutes outside the city. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything that I should\u2019ve asked you that I didn\u2019t that you think would help us figure out who makes a good BUD/S candidate? \r\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s\u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were to go back to your high school and give a talk about what it\u2019s like to be a SEAL, what would you be looking for if you were to interview people to see if they were suitable for BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\tI think I\u2019ve been told everything you really need to know about BUD/S, it\u2019s not physically that demanding but it really is all just the mental game and it really just depends on how bad you want to be here, if you don\u2019t want to be here\u2026 you\u2019re not gonna stick around for the beatings and being cold, but if you do wanna be here it\u2019s all worth it in the end.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: ENS Tom Evans\r\n\r\nDate:\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 68380\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 22:34\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, is it okay if I record the interview?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat your participant IDs are 68 and 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So easy questions first, when did you start BUD/s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh do you mean like date or class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n338.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when did you move into 339?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh so in second  phase uhh right after OC8 or Pool Comp, like midway through, uhh, they didn\u2019t have enough drager rigs for everyone uhh we were like seven guys heavy and they admin rolled it wasn\u2019t like performance or medical  roll it was like uhh too many people sorta thing.

Like my grandpa, my Dad\u2019s dad he\u2019s a green beret. My mom\u2019s dad was my age when he got drafted into Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm just something I knew I wanted to do umm it.

Either positive or negative?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm like death or anything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I mean like they could even be positive like something that stands out in your mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot really, I mean umm uhh I can\u2019t really think of anything uhh i mean uhh, even joining the Navy that was a rough time uhh. Me and my brother couldnt get in uhh we got disqualified from MEPs. Uhh so when I graduated high school in 2018  I just, me and my brother were just in limbo til like half a year, trying to get in like it was medical umm we both had like childhood asthma as a kid uhh they gave us a lot of problems for that uhh and it was like uhh like I didnt know what to do because I\u2019ve wanted to do this for so long umm so it was a rough time I think so uhh all I could think of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO with that you both were struggling to get the medical clearances, I mean what were you doing while you were waiting for all that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh I got a job.

My mom was uhh telling me you gotta sign up for college and I knew I wanted to come here and I got uhh a scholarship to go to SDSU umm I kinda like gave that up to come here. Finding out that I couldn't join was really uhh disheartening for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO what kinda got you to get the clearances to come..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took a while, but uhh we got a waiver umm but we took like four umm lung tests, tested our breathing, medicine and all this stuff and we were finally in the clear and they gave us waivers and we went to MEPs in December  and we shipped out to bootcamp in February. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay umm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: And did you guys start in the same class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did.

Umm in high school umm I got like a 4.23 GPA being like a high umm doing like tough stuff if that makes sense uhh. Like uhh I\u2019m also really timid uhh I like really quiet, uhh I like I love the saying \u201cbeing a quiet professional\u201d like uhh not talking to anyone umm like knowing what I\u2019m doing and doing something really meaningful and big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So umm obviously you said your Dad was a SEAL, btu anyone else in your family or was that your main motivator for wanting to become a SEAL?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm say it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So you said your Dad was  a SEAL, anyone else in your family that\u2019s a SEAL or special operations or Special Forces or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm my Grandad was Army Special Forces, he\u2019s a Green Beret.

Uhh when we were like eight my brother had already made the club swim team. SO we were really big in swimming and water so umm. Of course my grand- my grandpa was in the Army so like I never really considered that umm I kinda umm wanted to do like the hardest thing, the best thing, the most challenging thing umm.

Uhh I just uhh I loved uhh I feel in love with competition and just being challenged with uhh like cross country like umm when you're racing and you\u2019re next to the other guy and you\u2019re just racing and at the end your toe to toe I just kinda love that feeling of where you just sprint ahead of him and having more heart and even in wrestling like uhh the nervousness of going against someone before a match uhh I just really fell in love with being competitive and winning and uhh basically it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Tell me uhh tell me about the last five years leading up to BUD/S, high school and what was in between high school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I graduated in 2018 and about a month before a month or two before I graduated I went to the Navy recruitment office and got the paperwork going and uhh the whole thing about the medical after a while it worked out, just working out really hard, uhh got a job uhh and it was a really big deal uhh deal for my family.

And my family umm my dad my mom umm i feel like umm growing up in this kinda environment umm I couldn\u2019t come home if I wouldn\u2019t umm succeed. Umm I felt like uhh I couldn\u2019t see my famly again if I failed umm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you feel like the group like here supported one another and you through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike uhh the guys uhh I definitely couldn\u2019t have made it through without em like certain people here especially from coming from and being young  during this experience and some of these guys umm are 10, 12 years older than me and having so much more experience they defi italy helped me out. I couldn\u2019t umm have done uhh be where I\u2019m at without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Umm any physical, spiritual or mental practices that you utilize to get through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I\u2019m catholic uhh I prayed a lot umm uhh there were moments during Hellweek and even in the Island where I  where I thought there was no way I imma fail something like a testgate or Hellweek I, I  look up to God and prayed to Him, He uhh  definitely feel like it helped me through a lot of hard times even like getting getting to Bootcamp or getting through that rough patch after high school  to get here umm I definitely do have a lot of faith. That definitely helped me out.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What about was there ever a time where you had to make a difficult decision or like observe somebody or have to make like an ethical or moral decision here uhh at BUD/S or see someone kinda cheat the system a little bit and you had to make a decision to address it or that situation you\u2019re in. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm not really that I can recall, but umm  like cheating like uhh I can\u2019t really think of anything maybe like uhh I can\u2019t really think of anything like morally a situation here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Was somebody trying to cut corners or something like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmm not that I can remember uhh maybe in like Helweek some guys put padding like on their head like their hat so they don\u2019t lose as much hair uhh I didn\u2019t, uhh I didn't think much of it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just uhh I just always kinda thought like do the right thing uhh help everybody out, be for the guys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Umm why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nUmm just the I\u2019ll just never quit uhh there\u2019s moments like uhh how uh how am I gonna keep doing this, but you just do em. Like uhh you definitely like in the beginning I was definitely like scared but everything was so big and there was so much I had to go through but I kinda just put my head down and said \u201cbring it on\u201d.  You know like what else more can you do to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why was quitting such a none option for you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm one was just my family like umm even if I was tired of it umm just that legacy of my family like uhh umm I think my Dad told me me and my brother I think Sunday or Saturday night, Saturday night or Sunday morning that he was going to be on the berm Friday when we secure whether or not, if we\u2019re there or not. I just umm that was a really big motivator umm when I was in that dark void kinda spot like umm do it for the love of my family like my mom and my dad and not just for them but for myself like being, not having like you can\u2019t put a price on being  able to live with yourself I think that was a big part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What do you think the difference is between uhh those that are successful with this and not medically or physical, but with those that quit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh just the refusal to give up and just like uhh not being afraid to tackle what's behind  the door that you\u2019re about to face. Like not being afraid of any challenges or obstacles or pain that uhh like just not being afraid of what's behind the door that you\u2019re about to open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Umm hows this experience changed you as a person if at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI definitely think I\u2019ve matured like a lot in the past 7 or 8 months uhh I came here I definitely uhh was a procrastinator in high school umm I didn\u2019t really have as much umm I still have some problems with it but I definitely didn\u2019t have as much situational awareness umm as when I came here now I think I just uhh trying to be like uhh wanting to be squared away and being a good person and being a good student and uh one day hopefully be a good operator in the Teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SIO: Uhh anything else you think I should\u2019ve asked you, but I didn\u2019t ask you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I think that\u2019s good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha great that\u2019s everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, congratulations.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Robert Briggs\r\n\r\nDate:19 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 70\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:25 \r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so this is participant 70. So I\u2019ve got a series of questions about 8 of them I guess, broken down in parts. We\u2019ve got about 15 minutes to get through them. \r\n\r\nSounds good\r\n\r\nUm, so when did you start your BUD/s class?\r\n\r\nUh, I was in class 338 originally in prep. First phase, got rolled after hell week with \u201838 joined \u201839 and still here with \u201839. \r\n\r\nIs this your first BUD/s experience? \r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nI mean you got rolled, but then you\u2026\r\n\r\nYeah, this is my first shot at it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nUh, I\u2019ve got three other siblings. I\u2019m the oldest of 4 kids. \r\n\r\nSo yourself, then brother, sister?\r\n\r\nYeah, it\u2019s me then, uhm, two sisters and a younger brother. \r\n\r\nSister, sister, brother?\r\n\r\nYup. \r\n\r\nWhat was your parental situation growing up? \r\n\r\nGood, really good. Uhm, two hardworking, strong, christian parents. Uh\u2026\r\n\r\nSo married?\r\n\r\nYeah, they\u2019re married. \r\n\r\nSo you have a good relationship with both your parents?\r\n\r\nVery good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\nPrior to BUD/s? Uhm, I don\u2019t know if there is just one life changing event. I would say honestly, just, I was an over achiever growing up, but with that came a lot of failure as well, so just kind of dealing with failure and just you know getting back on the horse and you know continuing on and chasing whatever dream I was chasing that time in my life. Just doing that over and over and over again. Uhm, I would say that probably was the biggest impact on me. Just going through that same thing over and over again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How did that, how did that sort of experience of being an over achiever  and experiencing a lot of failure and getting right back on that horse and riding it contribute to your experience at BUD/s?\r\n\r\nUh, I mean I used pretty applications uh you know imagine uh, you know, you fail, you fail a lot here at BUD/s. Obviously, uhm you just gott keep dusting yourself off everyday and wake up and get after it the next day. You can\u2019t really dwell on, uhm, failing anything you know. I didn\u2019t really, like, I didn\u2019t really, It\u2019s not like I failed a bunch a bunch by any means, but just like you know you\u2019re never right kind of thing, you know always getting beat for whether you deserve it or not deserve it\u2019s just putting up with that day in and day out kind of, you know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUhm, I just, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been competitive really my whole life , so I would say that is probably the most applicable factor of my personality. Uhm, I, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just. I don\u2019t know how else to answer that, I guess. I just would say just a part of me uh made it easy to just keep getting after it everyday.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community.  In particular, what, what the question is asking about is do you have any SEALs family or friends? Do you have any military family or friends? \r\n\r\nUh, yeah. So I\u2019m from, I\u2019m from a small farm town in Northeast Kansas first off, so there\u2019s not that much exposure to uhm SEAL communities. Growing up I had no access, uhm, you know, just I read books about \u2018em. Uhm, you know thought they were the best and wanted to, uhm I wanted to pursue, I wanted to pursue something great like that, so uhm, I\u2019ve like always wanted to do it too, so it probably started when I was young, middle school or something like that, and uhm, I was always fascinated by kind of the higher that it is not for everybody, not everybody makes it through you know, only the strongest guys get to the end sort of thing, and that was appealing to me back then, and uhm, I guess that\u2019s why. Did I answer the question at all?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nCan you, can you repeat the question or something, like the first part of it?\r\n\r\nDo you have any...describe your background that led you to becoming a part of the SEAL community, and in particular, what, what the question is asking about is do you have any SEALs family or friends, or any military family or friends? \r\n\r\nCheck, check, gotcha. So yeah, no family, no friends that were in the teams. Uhm yeah, but I just grew up playing sports, uhm my entire life. I think that\u2019s, just probably that competitive environment was always to be a part of a team. Uhm, I\u2019ll say that was another draw for me, because that was like my life growing up that\u2019s really all I did, so all I really cared about was, uhm you know, whatever sports season I was in kind of a deal, so I would say that you know having that, being in that environment my entire childhood growing up and then into highschool and college I would say that is probably why, you know that the teams are very appealing to me. \r\n\r\nSo let me ask you a specific questions about your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child? Spanks, timeouts, grounding?\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So let me ask you a specific questions about your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child? Spanks, timeouts, grounding?\t\r\n\r\nAll of it, all. \r\n\r\nAll, everything?\r\n\r\nYeah, a good mix of all of that. Uhm, yeah, I was, uh, I never got in too much trouble thankfully, growing up, but when I was like real young, talking like, you know, kindergarten and stuff like that, uhm, I just remember my mom telling me that I did have like a special behavior chart growing up, you know, cause I was just always acting up, doing stuff, so uhm, but yeah, my parents did a good job of disciplining me and I just kind of snapped out of that. Uhm, I was a pretty good student throughout school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you, Did you move around as a child? \r\n\r\nUh, not too much. Uhm, so went to preschool and kindergarten in the place where are graduated then I went two years and did 1st grade and 2nd grade in another town, then came back to that town I graduated from, so. So, not too much moving around. \r\n\r\nSo, you said you participated in team sports in highschool. What sports?\r\n\r\nUhm, football, basketball, baseball, and I did track for two years. Did all the others for 4 years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last 5 years prior to coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh, I went to school. I played, uhm, I played baseball at the University of Sioux Falls South Dakota. Uhm, I did 5 years of college, so that was pretty much it. I graduated college. I took like another...I got lasik at the end of college so I had to wait like another 6 months to join because there\u2019s like uh you have to do that post getting surgery you have to wait like 6 months before you can join so waited that 6 months then joined as soon as that 6 months was up. \r\n\r\nAre you an officer?\r\n\r\nEnlisted. \r\n\r\nEnlisted?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nWith your college degree?\r\n\r\nYeah. You\u2019d be surprised, the majority of the e-dawgs here have college degrees. \r\n\r\n(Unintelligible)...What is your degree in?\u2019\r\n\r\nUh, exercise science with a minor in psychology. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?  \r\n\r\nImpulsive as far as like\u2026?\r\n\r\nIt says in a, as a personality.\r\n\r\nUhm, I don\u2019t know...I don\u2019t know about impulsive. Uhm, maybe I think like polarizing, a little bit, I always was, but I don\u2019t think impulsive. I wouldn\u2019t say that. \r\n\r\nSo an example that they give is, uh do you have any tattoos?  \r\n\r\nNo tattoos, no. \r\n\r\nApparently that\u2019s a sign of impulsivity.\r\n\r\nYeah, no tattoos, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was your most challenging component of BUD/S? \r\n\r\nUhm, probably getting rolled. I was rolled if I didn\u2019t tell you that. \r\n\r\nWhat did you get rolled for?\r\n\r\nI got rolled for drown proofing. \r\n\r\nFor what?\r\n\r\nFor drown proofing. So, you know tying your feet up, tying your hands up and\u2026\r\n\r\nOh, what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\nUhm, It was just like just not not quitting, not accepting failure as an option you know. Like I said I\u2019ve been down that road many a time and I knew that just you know it\u2019s just a drown proofing test, which is a stupid test. You know, uhm I was not going to let that stop me from achieving my goal. I had already made it through hell week at that point you know, so it was just, yeah. \r\n\r\nSo when you get rolled, do you go back to the start? And do it again or where you left off?\r\n\r\nNo, so I I picked up where I left off since I was a post hell week roll back. Uhm, if you don\u2019t make it to hell week and get rolled back for something medical or something like that you have to start at the beginning and make it through hell week. After hell week if you get rolled for something you\u2019re still in first phase, but you just pick up wherever you left off. \r\n\r\nWith the next class? \r\n\r\nWith the next class, yeah. \r\n\r\nDid you feel you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\nBy the other students? Oh, yeah 100 percent. 100 percent, yeah. Yeah, I was fortunate to have quite a few guys, quite a few post hell week guys got rolled back together for \u201838 as you can see a majority of the class is \u201838 original guys. Uhm, and that, those guys were awesome. You know like, a majority of us were top uhm, top performers from \u201838 that got rolled back for water evolutions and we kind of banded together and were not going to you know, not going to take you know failure as a final outcome kind of thing, and uhm, we all just got after it as being rollbacks, uhm improved our weaknesses and \tcame back a much stronger candidate after being rolled back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, what practices physical, mental, spiritual, etc. did you utilize to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nUh, practices as far as what specifically?\r\n\r\nLike physical, mental, spiritual.\r\n\r\nUh,\r\n\r\nDid you meditate? What did you do?\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really meditate or much of that. Uh, I guess I was just too stubborn to quit. I just, I knew going into it that I wasn\u2019t going to quit to be the reason you know that I didn\u2019t make it through that wasn\u2019t going to be the reason for not making it through. Uh, I wouldn\u2019t say I did any sort of meditation or anything like that. Uhm, yeah. Just stubbornness I guess that\u2019s the way to put it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? So, what decision did you really struggle with? For example, running classmates out or turning in someone for cheating. \r\n\r\nUhm \r\n\r\nWere there any instances of that for you?\r\n\r\nUh, no nothing nothing glaring. Yeah, I mean hell week was, hell week was a while ago now. Uh yeah I, I don\u2019t know. I guess there is nothing as solid for me having to do anything like that, I just you know, I went into, I went into hell week with with the attitude of you know give it the best, best I got, I\u2019m not going to quit. And if the best i got isn\u2019t enough, so be it. Uhm I can go out of my way to run certain guys out of the class and you know if they didn\u2019t keep up, they couldn\u2019t keep up and that was that, you know. But yea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, so you sort of answered this question, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nJust competitiveness, and just too stubborn to quit. I just you know failing as quitting was just not an option for me, and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those that did not make it?\r\n\r\nAnything different from us that did make it you mean?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\nUhm\r\n\r\nLike different from you. Your characteristics.\r\n\r\nI would say I mean, character I mean obvious answer it\u2019s not really character it\u2019s preparation you know, I can really see that guys from my perspective clearly did not uhm prepare the way they should have for the progrom. Uhm, I don\u2019t know why they choose not to do that, but uhm character wise, I don\u2019t know you can just see in some people just don\u2019t see it in other people and I think a lot of the guys that do quit, I was not surprised. Uh, you know there obviously are guys that you are surprised that quit. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s running through their mind. Uh, yeah, I don\u2019t know if I could put it on one character trait it just kind of, I don\u2019t know. We, we, uh, we did like two months of prep. We really do like two months of boot camp and then it\u2019s two months of prep then another month of PTRR before first phase, so you spend a lot of time with most guys before first phase even starts, so kind of from spending that time with those guys you can kind of see uh maybe who\u2019s not, those, those guys who are not maybe as mentally squared away as others sort of thing, so I don\u2019t know if I can put it on just one trait. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nUhm, that\u2019s a good question. Uhm, I don\u2019t know if it has changed me, uhm, as a person to much. Uhm I...that might, that might yup.\r\n\r\nAlright. \r\n\r\nThat make take some. That might take a little more reflection for me to answer that completely. \r\n\r\nAlright well we\u2019re about out of time anyway. \r\n\r\nAlright yeah sorry about that. \r\n\r\nNo problem\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: MCVICKERS\r\n\r\nDate: 12 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 71\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 24:15\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOK, is it OK if I record the interview? \r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\tAnd what\u2019s your participant ID?\r\n\r\n\tID 71. \r\n\r\n\t71, OK great. What was your original BUDS Class? \r\n\r\nIt was 338. \r\n\r\nAnd when did you get rolled into 339? \r\n\r\nI got rolled after Hell Week for the CSO Tread umm along with I think we had 8 other guys who got rolled for that as well. \r\n\r\nOK so that\u2019s still first phase. \r\n\r\nYeah post Hell Week first phase I think it was two weeks got over with. \r\n\r\nAnd so when you joined 339 you got to join though back at that same point?\r\n\r\nYep so we wait until they got to that point and then rejoined the class. \r\n\r\nAnd we\u2019ll come back and talk about that some more. So tell me about how many siblings you have?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got two siblings, two younger brothers, they\u2019re twins, their names are Brock and Brady. Umm they\u2019re 14 years old, 8th graders, umm yeah they\u2019re awesome uhh looked up to me a lot growing up. \r\n\r\nHow much older are you?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m 23 so I\u2019m 9 years older than they are. Umm but yeah we get along really really well but like I said they\u2019ve always kinda looked up to me so I\u2019ve tried to be a good mentor to them throughout their lives but they\u2019re huge into sports just like I was when I was a kid so we were always outside playing sports and stuff like that.  \r\n\r\nHow about parents? All the same parents or are your parents married?\r\n\r\nYep I\u2019ve got great parents, had a really good childhood they\u2019ve always been together, been together for about 35 years now. So yep I\u2019ve got great parents my dad is 58 years old and my mom is 53 I think. \r\n\r\nWhat about your relationship with them, is it close?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClose, really close. My whole family is really close, always has been. Family is very important to me and everyone in my family. Umm yeah so I was really lucky growing up, my parents were always super supportive,with like everything I did, it didn\u2019t really matter umm like I said I\u2019ve always been into sports and stuff like that but if all of the sudden I would say I didn\u2019t want to play a sport they would be fine with it, they would never force me to do anything. Umm and same with coming to the military, wanting to come to BUD/S, they were very supportive right away so they\u2019ve always been easy to deal with in that aspect, i\u2019ve always felt like I had a really good foundation from them, so. \r\n\r\nDid you now, go to high school, so what was after high school?\r\n\r\nYeah, so I went to high school and graduated, played sports in high school and then I decided not to play sports in college because, I wanted to play baseball in college and then decided last second that I wasn\u2019t going to, so I just went to the University of Nebraska, graduated from there, uhh I studied business management and it took me, I had to do one extra semester so I graduated December 2018 and then shipped out to Boot Camp in February. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll ask you some more questions about that in a minute. Anything life changing events that happened prior to you coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nLife changing events? For me there was nothing like crazy, nothing crazy I was just when I was in college I was doing fine umm but I was just kinda bored with what I was doing, you know? It just wasn\u2019t really for me, obviously I had finished my degree, you know my parents had saved all that money so I didn\u2019t want to waste all that and not get my degree but ever since I stopped playing sports I just didn\u2019t have anything to kind of go after and chase, nothing that excited me. Schoolwise I just didn\u2019t see myself getting a normal job after college umm I\u2019ve always liked things that are challenging and adventurous so that\u2019s kinda why I came here but as far as life changing events there wasn\u2019t any single event that was big for me. \r\n\r\nWhat about your personality, tell me a little bit about your personality and how that played into your experience here?\r\n\r\nUmm, personality I\u2019ve always been a pretty outgoing guy, always had a lot of friends growing up, like I said I loved to play sports, pretty adventurous, like studied abroad in college in the Czech Republic so yeah I would just say I\u2019m a very curious guy, I like to learn new things, very goal driven, goal oriented, I like to have something to go after. Umm pretty motivated person, umm what else, yeah I mean my family and friends are very important to me, what else, yeah that\u2019s about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about, I don\u2019t know if I asked you this, you went to University of Nebraska but where did you grow up?\r\n\r\nI grew up in Nebraska, I lived in a small town, Nemaha Nebraska until I was 7 and then my mom got a job up in Lincoln so we moved up to the capital city, lived there ever since, so pretty much grew up in the city but a lot of my family members are from the country. My grandparents are farmers so I got a lot of experience with the rural life and all that stuff. \r\n\r\nDid you help on the farm?\r\n\r\nYeah, yep I would go down there and help them, help him, helped my grandpa a lot. \r\n\r\nWhat about what led you to want to become a part of the SEAL community?\r\n\r\nUmm just because I thought they were the best of the best, you know? Just kinda the stereotypical things that you hear reading all the books and watching all the movies. The videos just looked awesome to me, sounded like they were the best of the best. So you know, some of these guys in here thought about being a Green Beret or a PJ, all those different things, but for me you know this was the only thing that I wanted to do umm I don\u2019t know it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the water. I know a lot of guys join because they like water. Umm for me it just looked like the hardest thing to do so that\u2019s what I wanted to do. \r\n\r\nNow, anybody that you know that was a SEAL?\r\n\r\nNo I didn\u2019t know anyone previously, I had met a few guys who like uh they have mentorship programs and stuff like that and I had a few friends that joined SEALs so I was able to train with them before I came but no I didn\u2019t have any family members or anybody close that I knew that was a that was a SEAL previously.\r\n\r\nAny military in your family?\r\n\r\nUhh my dad\u2019s dad was infantry in the Army, he fought in the Korean war. That was it. My other grandpa didn\u2019t end up getting drafted because he was a farmer um and then I think some of my grandpa\u2019s brothers were in the army but that didn\u2019t really play into my decision to join the military.\r\n\r\nSo it wasn\u2019t a big part of your life? At what point did you identify that you wanted to go into the military and then into the SEALs?\r\n\r\nUm I would say college I was kinda my junior year of college I started to really think about what I wanted to do. I\u2019ve always kinda had this in the back of my head I had a couple buddies that wanted to come here as well so we were kinda training for it together and then I would say between my junior and senior year of college I kinda said you know this is what I want to do. I told my parents and everything, really got serious about training um and then like I said as far as coming to BUD/S this was the only thing that I was really looking at. I didn\u2019t really look at the Marine Corps or Army or any of that stuff um I had some outside influences from a couple of my friends that were thinking about it as well. I had one buddy, a training partner that came here with class 337 and we kinda trained throughout college together. \r\n\r\nNow did he go through and complete BUD/S?\r\n\r\nNo, he quit BO so that was obviously pretty frustrating for me. Um he was able to come a class before me because he graduated before me so yeah that was a huge bummer for me. Yeah he quit when I was in BO \u2026 so I mean it was disappointing but at that point I had made so many good friends in class 338 it was like whatever, I got over it. \r\n\r\nStayed focused?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nWhat about, tell me a little bit about your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\nUm yeah I mean my parents weren\u2019t like super strict they also they wouldn\u2019t just let me get away with everything. Um I could usually always get away with things with my Dad more than my Mom for sure. Um but yeah they weren\u2019t super strict its not like I was getting grounded all the time but they definitely kept me on the straight and narrow like school was very important to them that\u2019s one thing they did not tolerate at all you know was me jacking around at school getting into trouble. Um I mean I was always a pretty good student at school. I knew when to lock it on and not mess around so as far like punishing me I used to get spanked as a little kid \u2026 getting grounded, I would get grounded. I was pretty stubborn as a kid so like I would always try to get myself out of it \u2026 I mean but yeah they weren\u2019t overly strict but also they wouldn\u2019t just let me do what I wanted. \r\n\r\nAnd then you said you only moved once in your childhood years and not too far?\r\n\r\nYep it was only like an hour away. \r\n\r\nWhat about your teenage years did you participate in sports talk to me a little bit more about that. \r\n\r\nYep yep I played football basketball baseball in highschool, loved sports that\u2019s like all I did, kept me out of trouble. Like I said baseball that was my big thing I wanted to play in college. For me though it was like if I couldn\u2019t play division one I didn\u2019t want to play and that\u2019s basically what happened that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t continue to play in college um but yeah sports was my life. \r\n\r\nAnd why were sports so important to you?\r\n\r\nI guess its just like the relationship, all my friends played sports and um that\u2019s all we would do. When I was a kid we would always play football out in the backyard, baseball um \u2026 in middle school we would travel all around the country I was on a travel team playing baseball so that was pretty much my life. Uh and I just loved it I loved the team aspect like I said all my best friends were guys I played sports with so I was always a huge fan growing up we would always go to Nebraska football games every Saturday. Yeah it\u2019s just always something I\u2019ve been into my whole life, I love sports. \r\n\r\nWhat about the last 5 years of your life before coming here, so college, any jobs in between?\r\n\r\nYeah I mean I had a lot of jobs in college, a lot of manual labor. I used to roof houses I worked on a ranch for a while for like a year. In college I worked at Coors in college, got free beer that was big um yeah a lot of like outdoorsy jobs I\u2019ve always been a pretty outdoorsy guy, never really wanted to just sit at a desk so I just went after that. \r\n\r\nWhat year did you graduate college?\r\n\r\nI graduated in December of 2018. \r\n\r\nAnd then that was right before bootcamp?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nSo no year long stints that weren\u2019t tied to part time jobs?\r\n\r\nNope, nothing .\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\nImpulsive? \u2026 Sometimes. \r\n\r\nIn what ways?\r\n\r\nUm, \u2026 man \u2026 just when there\u2019s any opportunity to do anything fun I\u2019ll go after it and sometimes that doesn\u2019t benefit me you know there\u2019s definitely times I could stay in and be more productive but if people are going out I\u2019ll go out .. um yeah just like in college any trips that people wanted to take I was always in for that. So yeah sometimes I\u2019m definitely an impulsive person but not to the extent where its super negative. \r\n\r\nAny tattoos? \r\n\r\nNo tattoos.\r\n\r\nMany speeding tickets?\r\n\r\nNope I think I have one speeding ticket, which actually kinda surprised me. I don\u2019t drive like a maniac but there\u2019s definitely guys like that like my buddy (unintelligible) driving like an idiot. But no, no tattoos no speeding tickets um as far as like run ins with the law \u2026 in college I got one MIP (minor in possession) that was like my sophomore year I wasn\u2019t like crazy drunk or anything I was just having a beer at this, it was my fault I was having a beer at this place and didn\u2019t have a wristband it was stupid. Like I said I wasn\u2019t drunk at all, wasn\u2019t a huge deal um went through that whole process or whatever. The Navy knows that I have that, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all that I\u2019ve had. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?\r\n\r\nYeah, I wouldn\u2019t say any single thing was terrible, for me it would just be like just the grind, just waking up on a Wednesday or whatever knowing that you\u2019re going to have to go out and give 100% again that day and you\u2019re super super tired um I would just say getting yourself out of bed in the morning \u2026 once you get the day going it wasn\u2019t actually that bad \u2026 um but that was actually one of the good things about Hell Week. You didn\u2019t deal with like having to wake up every day and being and like being in your warm comfortable bed you know um ... yeah I would say that was the one thing that was the hardest for me. Getting rolled sucked too. Umm just having to watch all of my good buddies go on with training and I have to sit back for seven weeks for one tread is what we failed, what we got rolled for. That was pretty tough at first but it ended up being one of the best things to happen to me. It was definitely a positive. \r\n\r\nWhat helped you get through that?\r\n\r\nUm well first of all I got lucky because the other eight guys who got rolled with me I am pretty good buddies with so being with them was huge um the guys in this class are awesome I love class 339 um \u2026 what else \u2026 just having that time to kinda grow and um it was right after Hell Week so it gave me some time to relax and rejuvenate myself metnally and physically and then you know take a step and see what I can work on and get better um you know and I figured if I have seven weeks off I\u2019m not going to waste my time I\u2019m going to try to come back a better BUD/S student. Um and in the long run it definitely, after I came back from that I had no issues, I hardly failed anything at all so I definitely think it was a positive thing. \r\n\r\nAny practices you utilized throughout this process to go through BUD/S whether physical, mental, spiritual?\r\n\r\nNothing big really you know I tried to take care of my body during First Phase I could have stretched more, I would go get massages on the weekend sometimes \u2026 um as far as mentally I just tried I just tried to get as much sleep as I could. On the weekends a lot of times um a lot of times they would have guys in the barracks that you could pay that would shine your boots. I would always pay someone to shine my boots um \u2026 yeah I just tried to take care of my body get as much sleep as you can. You know you would see guys throughout the pipeline who were getting sick were hardly ever making it. They would get rolled or they would quit because they were always getting rolled. So that was a big thing for me I just wanted to keep my body healthy for as long as I could because you would see guys get rolled and the second time they would go through they just don\u2019t have it in them anymore. \r\n\r\nWas there a time you had to make a difficult decision or watched someone make a difficult decision?\r\n\r\nIn BUD/S you\u2019re saying?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\nDifficult decision \u2026 um nothing is really popping into my head right now, my class was pretty good at holding each other accountable so we didn\u2019t really run into any big issues for that um yeah you know since I\u2019m not an officer that wasn\u2019t really my place all the time \u2026 um for me if there was anything big I would obviously step up and say something but most of the time I would just kinda try to mind my own business and uh try to do the right thing myself and just worry about myself. \r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm for me it was just like I pretty much gave up my whole life to come here um I\u2019m not going to say there were never times where \u2026 I never really thought about quitting at all I knew I wasn\u2019t going to quit for sure but just having that in the back of my head, having been though boot camp, I gave up my whole life to come here I knew that there was no way I was going to quit. I wouldn\u2019t say I was a \u2026 I wasn\u2019t a great performer by any means in BUD/S. I passed all my stuff you know I was fine um but its not like I was leading the 4 mile runs or the swims I was more of a middle of the pack guy. But for me I think one of my personality strengths that helped me get through is I was pretty stubborn and there was no way I was going to let the instructors see me quit. I wouldn\u2019t let them win. Like I said my parents were always very supportive um honestly if I were to quit they would have been the parents that said that\u2019s OK they wouldn\u2019t have been super disappointed or anything like that um \u2026 but yeah there wasn\u2019t anything big it was just not quitting you know and just passing all the tests you need to pass. And a little bit of luck too you know, not getting injured, not getting crazy sick is big. That\u2019s the advice that I always give guys going through First Phase you know, just take care of your body because once you get sick or injured there\u2019s not much you can do, you\u2019re kinda screwed. \r\n\r\nWhat about anything different about those people that made it versus those that quit. Not those that got sick.\r\n\r\nUm anything different \u2026 like personality wise?\r\n\r\nAnything that stands out if at all. \r\n\r\nFor me I felt like most of the guys that made it through I kinda knew that they would make it through I don\u2019t know if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nWas there something about them? Like a demeanor?\r\n\r\nYeah kinda their demeanor. We used to say a lot in First Phase that he\u2019s got the eyes. Like we knew somebody was gonna quit just by like their demeanor every day um so just the guys that they could beat us all day long and they could wake up the next day with a good attitude. A huge thing was um being able to have a sense of humor that was huge. Like a ton of these guys in here have a sense of humor, that\u2019s huge in making in through BUD/S um a lot of the guys that took everything way too seriously when we were in Prep and in BO, a lot of those guys did not make it. Um so just um being able to lock it on when you need to but also having a sense or humor was big for me um \u2026 yeah just guys that don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, guys that are able to, you\u2019re gonna have a bad day in BUD/S where you get embarrassed or you\u2019re a poor performer or you know you might get called out. Just not letting that eat you alive \u2026 and then just guys that didn\u2019t take into account what the instructors were saying, not taking that too seriously. I saw a lot of instructors get in guys heads and then they\u2019ll quit so basically just not caring about what an instructor has to say to you. Kinda just knowing the game, knowing that they\u2019re just trying to get you to quit and not taking that too seriously. \r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nUm \u2026 change me as a person \u2026 what definitely helped me as far as getting rolled that just helped me to deal with failure that taught me to come back a better person. Learn how to use that and turn that into a positive that was huge \u2026 um its definitely made me a less selfish person being around all these guys you know um just doing what\u2019s best for the class not yourself and seeing how that returns as a positive to you. Uh as far as toughness and stuff, I came into this telling myself I wasn\u2019t going to quit and I never felt like I was going to quit so I don\u2019t really feel like I changed too much in that aspect um but obviously you do learn like how far you can push yourself and uh how far your body can go basically if you just don\u2019t give up um I feel like that\u2019s a lesson that everybody learns. Kinda a cliche lesson but its true \u2026 other than that \u2026 I don\u2019t know uh I\u2019ve learned a lot about leadership I\u2019m trying to become a better leader. That\u2019s something that they stress a lot here and if you\u2019re just an E Dog, an enlisted guy, being able to step up and lead your buddy that\u2019s something too that\u2019s what you get from working on it. That\u2019s something I\u2019m not great at but have gotten better at since I\u2019ve been working on it. \r\n\r\nGreat, we\u2019re done interviewing. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it? Thank you. \r\n\r\nCongratulations.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jake Rude\r\n\r\nDate:\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 72\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI: It\u2019s a little formal at the beginning.\r\n\r\nP: I think you guys got good research, I think it\u2019ll be interesting to see the results\r\n\r\nI: It\u2019s been great.\r\n\r\nP: I think being involved in it was pretty cool.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah and the first part is already at *cannot understand*. So just you know I\u2019m recording.\r\n\r\nP: Got it.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, I want to get your participant ID number.\r\n\r\nP: 72\r\n\r\nI: 72\u2026 and that\u2019s your informed consent?\r\n\r\nP: Yes.\r\n\r\nI: I\u2019ll take that from you, yup, you\u2019re good. Up add a date. Okay. Perfect! So, first questions are easy then I get to the hard ones.  *laughs*\r\n\r\nP: That\u2019s fine, whatever you need.\r\n\r\nI: So...uh\u2026 Just tell me a little bit about how many siblings you have?... Birth order\u2026\r\n\r\nP: I am the oldest, I have one younger sister, uh, she is three years younger than me.\r\n\r\nI: Okay\r\n\r\nP: I\u2019m 26.\r\n\r\nI: So one sibling and sister\u2026right?\r\n\r\nP: Yes.\r\n\r\nI: uhm, so, if you think about kind of your life experience and what do you think you would consider kind of your crucible or kind of life-changing kind of experiences that you\u2019ve gone through.\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I think my situation is a little unique.\r\n\r\nI: mmhm.\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I wanted to do this since I was a kid.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: And my three best friends who I grew up with also wanted to do this and they\u2019ve all made it through.\r\n\r\nI: Really? \r\n\r\nP: They're all in teams now, so I am the last one to make it through.\r\n\r\nI: Oh interesting.\r\n\r\nP: I wanted to do it before them, and I\u2019ll put that on the record that I wanted to do this before them *scoffs* , but yeah uh I need a medical waiver to get in and it took me three years to get that.\r\n\r\nI: Okay.\r\n\r\nP: And that was a big crucible. Like that was A big, very up and down emotional process because this is all I ever wanted to do and I kind of just got told by this one doctor that should never allow it.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: and Uh, here I am, so worked out. It just took three years and a lot of lot of work. Uhmm, but I grew up in connecticut and uhm I grew up in a wealthy like a wealthy family.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, struggled, I was a really bad athlete growing up. I struggled academically. Uhmm and I also didn\u2019t really care that I struggled academically. I was super concerned with like playing video games that I thought would bring me closer to this.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: uhm and then like around 16, my dad sent me to this Navy SEAL summer camp thinking it would like make me not want to do this anymore and they had me like jumping out of helicopters and stuff and shooting guns and I was like \u201cI\u2019m doing that!\u201d And then, uh, a couple years later, I went to another one that was like really hard, uhm, and I got through that and that was a big confidence booster for me. And then I started running ulta-marathons and skydiving, trying to build my resume for this waiver I needed.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: So that kind of like span of years, increased my confidence a lot. So when I came here, I felt like I could handle anything they threw at me.\r\n\r\nI: That\u2019s great.\r\n\r\nP: So that was that was kind of why I think it was unique. Like I lot of guys didn\u2019t do that kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nI: So with that kind of mental piece, I mean what was it that kind of took, like was it your constant pushing to get through that.\r\n\r\nP: *sighs* My parents would say I\u2019m just stubborn. Uhm, *sighs* I just wasn\u2019t going to take no for answer, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I just like wanted to do this since I was a little kid, I\u2019m gonna uhh, I\u2019m gonna do it. I was, I remember in college when I made the decision to have surgery. I had surgery for two herniated disks in my lower back and I remember like knowing this could jeopardize everything, but I was in a lot of pain at the time\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: and uhm, I was like, I made a commitment to myself, I was like if they say no, I\u2019m gonna fight it to the highest level possible and then I\u2019m gonna fight even more. And it literally came to that. Like I was talking to people, *Stutters* not a th president\u2019s level, but in the White House and stuff...\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.\r\n\r\nP: \u2026 Trying to make this happen. Ended up not working out that way anyways. Ended up working at the lower level, but yeah it was a really long story, but uh I think for me, just ingrained in me, that just through the process of getting here, like there\u2019s no way I\u2019m not doing this and plus with all my best friends coming here who are encouraging me the whole way. I moved out here to live with some of them, so I was around SEALs. It was\u2026 I knew what I wanted to do.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, so what about your personality, I mean you said you\u2019re kind of stubborn, but what about your personality contributed to getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nP: Uhmm, I don\u2019t know I think I have a good sense of humor, uhm, pretty disciplined. I like to party a lot which I actually think helps, I\u2019m not even kidding.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, why do you think partying helps?\r\n\r\nP: Decompression. Most guys I know, I mean, most of my friends party pretty hard too and, we, we\u2019ve agreed its like a really good way for us to decompress. This isn\u2019t gonna be shown to the BUD/S staff right? Cause I like drank every weekend as well.\r\n\r\nI: No and they won\u2019t even know who it is.\r\n\r\nP: Oh okay. Yeah I drank the whole weekends, like every weekend, like even before hell week and  everything. Like I would go out dranking with my buddies and like thathat\u2019s not the best physically for you but like that was how I decompressed.  I feel crazy for saying that was kinda how I felt with everything. Um Im not like an alcoholic or anything but I just love that was m;y that was my way to go out and have fun. Um and you know my buddies would keep encouraging me every weekend I was with them so that helped and then also sometimes you just have to chill out and relax um I kinda digress here I think  personality wise like I was training I remember training before coming here because it took  me so long more then I remember Buds, buds how we, Hell week was only a week first phase is only a like a month, um.. But I remember just being pretty consistent. Consistency was big um. There were days, like I really didn't want to do something and I just do it anyways. A lot of that was peer pressure too because I had my friends there who, they were showing up to do the workouts too even though none of us wanted to do it, um\u2026 I don't know.  I\u2019m not the smartest guy, like I, I just kinda, I like to think that I was just dumb and just kept going, like one step in front of the other, or one foot in front of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, sometimes that's what it takes.\r\n\r\nP: Yeah\r\n\r\nI: What about, I mean you talked about, um our background a little bit and your family background but what do you think about your background led you to want to become a Naval officer?\r\n\r\nP: Um, I remember it kind of evolved over the years. When I was like really young, I was dead set on like the action hero and the shooting and all that and like, I never lost that but it matured in that I remember my dad drove me down the coast of California when I was like 15 and um, I just like, and was like wow we live in an amazing country. Like, because I grew up on the east coast, we have a beautiful area I grew up in, this beautiful state and then everything in between all these great people, I got like very patriotic from that, I never lost that umm, just the, the real big inspiring factor for me was just being around SEALs, like I met a lot of them when I was younger and I was really inspired by their character and just their caliber of men they were. That just the biggest thing for me.\r\n\r\nI: Now, were you apart of a military family or?\r\n\r\nP: No, my father is like a wealthy wall street type guy and my mother has been a flight attendant for Delta Airlines for forty years. Ummm and uh noone really in my family was in the military. I don\u2019t know, I wanted to be a Marine up until I was 10 because I thought they were what SEALs are and then I found out the difference and I was like \u201cI wanna be a SEAL.\u201d And if I couldn\u2019t get in the Navy with the waiver I needed, it was pretty set I was going to go in the Army. I knew like Special Operations was it for me. I saw it as the best capacity to serve. I saw it as really high caliber of men. Uhh constantly being challenge, there were a lot of factors, but I just really wanna do this. I never had to, at least not so far, I never had to question why I was doing it, the training, like, there was never a moment where I like I needed to draw on that. Where I\u2019d here guys, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but I hear guys who kind of needed to remind themselves. For me, it was just in my brain, I knew, I knew why I was here.\r\n\r\nI: So you mentioned your childhood before, what was your parents parenting style?\r\n\r\nP: Ummmm hopefully they don\u2019t hear this, my mom\u2019s an alcoholic and was more or less either not present or just drunk my entire life. I love my mom, but  she has her demons. My father was like the best guy in the World. He was like my biggest inspiration like he put up with so much crap grinding through stressful jobs, it really inspired. Ummm, he was always like he didn\u2019t love that I wanted to do this, but he supported me and then he made an effort to learn about it and that really really made proud of him and he was just always there, he would do anything for us, but also disciplined us when needed because I was somewhat of a deviant kid growing up. I never got in trouble with the law, but uh I didn;t make it easy for him, but he still put with it.\r\n\r\nI: So with that, so with like discipline, how were you kinda disciplined. Were you spanked? Were you put in time out\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: I remember being spanked a little bit growing up uhhhhh, my timeouts and being grounded. I was a little bit of smoozer and I could get my way out of a lot of punishments, but I, he set an example where I didn\u2019t want to let my Dad down, so as I got older, I either didn\u2019t do anything stupid or made sure I wasn\u2019t going to get cut doing it. And big thing to answer that was we had an open policy where I was pretty honest with him about most things, so they I was staying out past curfew, they knew I was drinking underage, they knew my friends were smoking weed and uhhh they they were pretty cool with it. They didn\u2019t love most things, but they were a lot laid back then most parents and they gave me the rope to hang myself at every bit, so uhm.\r\n\r\nI:So I wanted to talk a little bit about your teenage years, so what kind of activities were you into? Were you into team sports or any other kind of team maybe not exactly a sport type of activity?\r\n\r\nP: I ran, uh, track, cross country, I joined the swim my senior year, when I really got even more serious about coming here. I, uh, in college I walked on a division 1 crew team. I didn\u2019t stay for very long because I injured my back. I stayed for like one season, but uh it was never like official, but my buddies that I mentioned who wanted to do this with me. I trained with them religiously, in a sense we were our own little team. We did everything together, we trained together, we partied together, we hung out together, we got food together together, we grilled at each others houses, our Dad\u2019s were friends.\r\n\r\nI: Now were you high school buddies?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah we all graduated high school the same year. Um so that was my own little thing, just being with those guys\r\n\r\nI: *something about ensuring the recorder is still recording* So uhhm anything else about your teenage that you was formative? \r\n\r\nP: Noooo\u2026. I wanted to come here at 18 and my dad talked me out of it. He said go to college. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve made it at 18, you could  put that on the record. I mean maybe I would\u2019ve, but I needed my body to mature, I needed to mentally mature . umm yeah, I don\u2019t think, I certainly wanted it really bad, but I don\u2019t think, something wouldnt have worked out.\r\n\r\nI: Now what about the last five years of your life leading up to BUD/s. What did you do with that time?\r\n\r\nP: I worked like random jobs. I had like a dozen different part time jobs just trying to get this waiver, it was uh. I uhh saw myself leave at different times. I didn;t get into any like serious work. I was a lifeguard, at a wine safe awhile, uhh I made hot sauce in New York City. I learned to like try and do new things umm. I gave swim lessons, I worked as a grounds keeper on a golf course, uh a caddie, a camp counselor. Random summer type jobs I just did. I worked at a crossfit gym out here. I worked as a valet for awhile. Just random stuff like that, but nothing career wise.\r\n\r\nI: So what about uhm behaviors. Would you consider yourself like in that kind of five year time space, compulsive?\r\n\r\nP: No not compulsive, I was pretty consistent. I had like a routine I\u2019d like it follow. Spend as much time training as possible. Um and uh reading, I was really big into reading. Especially since I graduated college. I got really into reading and exercising the mind just as much as the body. Um I got really into that, listened to podcasts, just try to be productive. I had this motto it was like do something productive. Even if it was listening to podcasts, its better than listening to music and like I tried to fill as much of time that was possible. There definitely been ebbs and flows as far as success. Like how I distracted I get, coming out of BUD/s, I did\u2019t have a lot of free time so I spent most of it with my friends partying or relaxing in a hot tub or something or watching movies. Um I just now started reading a book this morning, I\u2019m getting back into it. That was like the optimal state I wanted to end up at. That was, I remember before I came into the Navy, I was kind of at a high point in terms of productivity. Working a ton, uhh, exercising a ton. My friends all shipped so I wasn;t doing all the partying as much as I used to and then I came into the Navy and that all kind of fell apart.\r\n\r\nI:  Now would uh what kind of activities would you do that were impulsive. Have you done anything impulsive, like do you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\nP: No.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm anything like speeding tickets?\r\n\r\nP: No, I don;t have any tattoos. I have no uh. I think I got one speeding ticket in college and I definitely deserved. It was the only I think I have ever gotten. I never got in trouble with the law. Uhhm, I don\u2019t know, I try and be transparent as possible here uhm, not super proud of it, but probably the most influencing thing is like drinking too much sometimes. Uh definitely, uhm that\u2019s probably the most impulsive thing and that\u2019s like that probably a product of me being around I surround the people I spend my time with. They party pretty hard too and I like up to them. They are all senior to me in the Navy. Yeah other than that, pretty disciplined.\r\n\r\nI: What do you think motivates you on a day like where you guys like\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: Not letting my friends down who are like further along than me. \r\n\r\nI: Okay.\r\n\r\nP: Like being the best I can be because potentially some day, people\u2019s lives can count on it.\r\n\r\nI: And uhm and when you say your friends that\u2019s the three buddies that..?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah and there\u2019s a few more who I knew, I didn\u2019t know them in high school, but I knew them before they were in the Navy and now they uhh, they\u2019ve done deployments already and I uhh lived with two of them out here before they were deployed and they were kind of like mentors to me, So I look up to them.\r\n\r\nI: Now uhm *cannot discern* uhm and then what do you think, now more specifically at BUD/S, what was the most challenging thing, whether it was a specific day or more of an event?\r\n\r\nP: Uhh, I never, I preface it with that I never thought about quitting, like I never seriously contemplated leaving the program, I knew why I was here. That said, there were times where it was tough to really get yourself as far as you would be on a good day. Uhm I particularly found that second phase to be hard mentally. I really struggled with the OC8 test, I went to my last attempt, uhm, I wasn\u2019t crazy about diving, so that like, I ended up being pretty good at it, but I just didn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t the island was a drag, but it was cool. I can tell you the most painful thing I ever experienced and thing i never want to experience again was the CS gas on the island where they gassed us. I don\u2019t know if they prefaced you guys on that. The single worst terrible thing I ever did in my life. I don\u2019t know even if you\u2019re allowed to talk about that in your article.\r\n\r\nI: *laughs* probably not\r\n\r\nP: They don\u2019t advertise that. That was for sure the worst thing I have ever done in my life.\r\n\r\nI: So what motivated you to push through that?\r\n\r\nP: Uhh not knowing how bad it was. So like they did it. Right as it was starting, I was like alright let\u2019s go. And then like it makes you want to just like run away. I remember, I don\u2019t know how or why, but like all I could focus on was my internal dialogue except it was just so painful and I was just like stay, stay, stay. I just kept saying stay and just like trying, knowing it would end really soon because it was only like a minute and I kind of just rode it out and it ended just like everything ever does.\r\n\r\nI: So whether, its that event or other events, was there group support or was it more individual that was kind of getting you through?\r\n\r\nP: I don\u2019t remember a lot of like group like come on like guys would try and do that, I felt like a lot of it was internal, but sometimes I would get that group support just by looking at another dude and being like he\u2019s here too. He\u2019s doing it, I\u2019m gonna do it too. There wasn\u2019t a lot of like cheerleading, but just being in the presence of other guys was enough for me. Some people may feel differently. I don\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t perfect in this program either, like I\u2026\r\n\r\nI: Its okay, were there any specific practices whether physical, spiritual, or mental that you used to help you get you through challenges?\r\n\r\nP: Yes, big thing for me, was positive self talk, setting micro goals, uhm visualization was huge for the testing stuff. Uhm and uh *pause* I kind of had some mantras in my head like positive mantras that I would just recite. I did a lot of counting down from 10 when things got bad. I just count to 10 and then back down, up and down from  10 just to like focus on something. The single biggest thing was setting micro goals like just like taking things one bite at a time. That was huge and I learned that from a SEAL who made me practice it like before I joined the Navy, I did a 50 mile Ultra Marathon and that was harder for me because I didn\u2019t like have that  micro goal thing down and I had to like learn it on the fly and then I came here and I had had the muscle memory so that helped a lot. And I remember being in hell week thinking like I\u2019ve been here before.\r\n\r\nI: Just like keep going.\r\n\r\nP: Yup.\r\n\r\nI: What do you think, here at BUD/S, what do you think went through your mind when trying to make that difficult decision?\r\n\r\nP: uhm what difficult decision?\r\n\r\nI: Uhm any difficult decision whether it was ethical whether it was just\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm how would this look to the other guys. Would this be viewed favorably by the guys that I care about or just\u2026\r\n\r\nI: Do you have any specific examples?\r\n\r\nP: No, not off the top of my head. Uh, sometimes like, I remember we had to like hit the surf at night and you were already wet. No one could see if you did it or not and there would be a debate whether I could get away with not doing and uhh I always knew that it would be like not favorable to do it because every one else was doing it. So it was just like cutting corners like that where you couldn\u2019t really hurt anyone, you might get a little more comfort out of it, uhm, but I remember just being inspired by the dudes to not take that choice, so.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, Why do you think you were successful at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nP: oh geez, uhm luck, luck and uhm uhh just still trying to figure that out honestly. I think the ability to take things one step at a time. That for me was, personally, was the single biggest thing, just those little micro goals. Just taking one little bite of something and then two, three, four, five and next thing you know you\u2019re halfway done and then you\u2019re on the downhill. Like i remember hell week like before it started when you\u2019re in the tent and everybody was all nervous. I didn\u2019t think a second after Tuesday morning. I was like if I am still here Tuesday morning, I know I am going to make it because I am like so close to getting all the hard stuff done even though we still had like days left. I knew like a lot of the hard stuff was done by like Tuesday night, Wednesday. So I was like just get to Tuesday morning and then you\u2019re a few hours away from there, I can do anything for a few hours and then it\u2019s kind of just like auto pilot, so I did that and then Tuesday morning came and I was like there\u2019s no doubt in my mind.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, what do you think made the difference, like did you notice any difference between you and the people that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\nP: Some really good guys didn\u2019t make it. Some of my close friends didn\u2019t make it. For me, I think it was just like how long it took me to get here. I feel like my commitment had already been tested. Uhm, I had been around guys who before I came here who would look at dudes who quit and be like oh like screw that guy blah blah, he\u2019s weak. I don\u2019t feel that way about at all about guys. I think there\u2019s some great dudes who didn\u2019t make it, definitely some luck involved like how hurt a guy is or whatever. Uhm, I don\u2019t know, for me personally, I really don\u2019t feel that much different then a lot of those guys. I think maybe it was just that I wanted this more. I certainly could tell you that athletically, I wasn\u2019t better than a lot of them, I just was committed, so.\r\n\r\nI: Okay that\u2019s it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Isaac Bengel\r\n\r\nDate: 8/11/2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 348\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 22:19\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Is it okay if I record that interview? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then you're participant ID numbers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventy three, and three four eight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Seventy three and three Forty eight. So easy questions first. Um what class BUDS class did you start in. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh 338. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot rolled into 339. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when did you get rolled into 339? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn second phase first, OC-8. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. How many siblings do you have? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm one of five. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow, OK. And what's the birth order? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an older sister, I'm second. And then a younger brother, he's the middle guy he's kind of weird. And then one sister and the littlest is a brother,. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, Sister. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlder sister. Younger sister. Two younger brothers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you're number two? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, and then what's your situation? Two parent household are those from the same parents, all 100 percent full siblings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, and then what's your kind of relationship with their parents? Close? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah we're really close. My whole family is pretty much I mean, just really close, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Uh, where did you grow up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up all over the place. I was born in Wyoming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd didn't live there very long and moved to a Eskimo village in Alaska. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I moved from there to Central America for three years and then I moved to Guam. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so what took you guys moving all around? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were Christian missionaries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then he joined the army. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWent to Hawaii. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it. He's still in the army? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot anymore. He's out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so were they you woulds all were all part of as Christian move? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh the first two. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst two and then others were Army move? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm any sort of life changing events that happened to you prior to coming to BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope, not really. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing like the higher level? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty average. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me a little bit about your personality. What's that like and how is that contributed to getting through BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say I mean, since I've had to move around a lot, I mean, I've gotten pretty good at making friends really easily. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause I leave them and then I make new ones. But I'm pretty social for the most part. But I'm really quiet sometimes. I get some pretty energetic in the mornings, a lot of guys get annoyed by that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. What led you to want to become a SEAL? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo initially like I always kind of knew. I didn't really know what like America was growing up in, like, little Eskimo village. I didn't really hear about a whole lot about the homeland, I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then when I moved to Central America, I didn't really know anything about America besides home schooling. What I learned uh in textbooks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut then I was like, I have this great idea of bing like a soldier that's like cool to me. I  don't know why. And then I saw, like, I kind of found out what it was about, like a trailer in a movie that I wasn't allowed to watch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that's how kinda I found out about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow old were you when you kind of? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike eight years old? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it kind of developed from there into something, obviously. It's like you're rocking the chair a little bit. That is kind of more romanticized. That's cool. It's still cool, but it's like. Yeeah now there's like a purpose behind it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. And you said, so your dad join the army after you were born. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. We were I was 10 years old. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe joined the army, we moved to Hawaii. And that was our first and only duty station. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I spent kinda the more all my teenage years or still a teenager but spent more of its formative years there in Hawaii. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK And how long and where do you go after Hawaii? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to Kansas City for nine months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we finished high school. Yes, Virginia Beach for five years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK Anybody else? The military and your family or around you, your friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah grandpa. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then great-grandpa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere they Army or Navy? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, Army then one was a Marine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat grandpa was Marine Corps in World War II. They don't really talk about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know, I didn't really receive any influence for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK Um what about your your childhood was specifically about like discipline. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpankings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanking? You're the first person that's answered that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I mean, other people have said that just just immediately you have an answer for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, spankings. We didn't do time out. I don't even know like. I mean, it guess it could be useful, but it's definitely there's something to be said about kids misbehaving, spank em, shake them up I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think that helped? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI definitely think so. Obviously not in the moment. But looking back, I mean, respect the style of parenting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery. Not like strict strict parents but definitely like firm. You know, you're being a little naughty boy I mean obviously. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, what about. So we talked about you moving kind of throughout your childhood when you were like in Alaska. What were your ages for all these differen moves that you had. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, Wyoming, I think, it was like when I spent my first year of life there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen turned five in Alaska. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost six moved to Central America, that is where my mom is from. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrew up from like six to almost 11, almost 11 years old. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, almost. Hawaii 10-11 to 17. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then 18 I moved to Missouri. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr 18 in bootcamp. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bootcamp ok. And so you did a high school and then went right to boot camp. Nothing in between. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, I spent five months in Virginia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust moving with my family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me, it wasn't a lot of downtime. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So you just graduated high school, went to Virginia Beach with them and then. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK So when you finish high school, did you knew you were going to join the military? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Ma'am. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm and what about during your teenage years? Did you do any sports or do any? Let's head back to this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI surfed a lot in Hawaii a bit some competitive surfing. But not too much. I had, like, this dream of, like going pro, but obviously, like, it's not going to happen obviously. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut um, I played soccer and I don't know, I kind of heard. My buddy Swartz were talking about like, each sport he played was his favorite sport. Like I kind of switch interest a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings that I took an interest in, like surfing. I was like, oh, well, that's surfing. You know, when I started soccer. I'm like, OK, forget surfing I'm all about soccer. It's kind of like that. And that was the sport I played all the way through. And after, through high school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK Um anything about kind of being part of that sport that you think like as a team helped you here? Blend into the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, I would say no. Just cause like I feel like I didn't really play on like a team, whereas like I was rather good. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, I played on it like a travel soccer team. Everyone comes from different schools. But you all come together. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo play and you're not like they were all pretty good friends but I was new to the team. So they have like as deep friendships. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh huh. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was just there to play and we all pretty much love playing as one team. That was one thing we had in common. I don't know. Definitely nothing, really. I mean, here it is so much different. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what way? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust that, like, we're all actually like good friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore so, like instead of just we're just playing with the other like here it's like we're playing together. It's so like for reall. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're bros. And friends outside of work. I mean the stakes are a lot higher obviously. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so we can we can talked about it but I'm just trying to make sure I'm clear. So if you think about the last five years of your life leading up to being here, so you had high school, Virginia Beach and then boot camp right? And then when did you go to boot camp? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo February 4th went boot camp. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty nineteen? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2019 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh so you're kind of one of the younger younger people here. Uh how do you think that played into your experience here? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI definitely think like right off the bat, you kinda have to earn the guys respect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEspecially, cause you're that younger, you kinda have to show up ok I'm I can't be immature and not just, you know. But we'll find games all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know, there's times when you have to turn that off enough. I always say like it's kind of like a dial, dial it on for work or turn  it back. But I definitely think as like you go on and prove yourself that they perceive for like what what work you're capable of doing? Rather than your age and being like ok he's young and like you can't work hard. So, I mean, it kind of in first phase. It definitely was more of a hurdle. Cause like everyone's so new. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, as you know, now coming back from the island it's like, OK, I'm the same as him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all aspects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMakes sense. How about do you consider yourself impulsive at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what ways? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery way. No, haha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say one way that I really need to work on is I have a hard time saying no to people. So if I have plans to go do something and someone like, you know, you want to go do this and say yes to that right away without even thinking about it. Ok, I already have all these other plans that I said yes too. That's one way. I'm definitely like, it's a bad thing that I'm impulsive. So I've been trying to get my finances under wraps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is definitely good to do at a younger age. But you know I've gotten away from impulsive buying. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So you say that you have some impulsive buying, like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. It's just like food related stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I don't need to go eat out. Oh, there it is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut not like going to buy a car or like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did buy a car after Hell Week that I needed to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't, yeah. It was something you needed. What about tattoos anything like that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(intelligible) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, what do you think the most challenging component of BUDS was? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gas. What might've been that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot me through it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was that I couldn't breathe that I couldn't run away, no but uh I don't know. I guess I didn't really have to think about it. I was just going to be there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not like I didn't have to think, like, OK, we're going to stay like it's. Everything else you can kinda just do but that's like something that we've never been exposed to. It was weird to go through something in here like something that'll make grown men scream in pain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd like I don't know as I play something, even though it's so short, it's pretty intense. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, but you think like you got through it just by literally you're, you're not going to do anything else but get through it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I had no like second thoughts. Like think it's something I can do just another thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else that you think was like you would top up there with the gas experience here at BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOC-8. I mean, getting rolled for that, definitely like there is a couple times, where I was like ok, can I do this? Yeah that I was kind of a little bump. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. What got you past that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitely just taking the time to just put in work like hours of dirt diving. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough all these possible situations and then going into it confident. Cause it's really easy to be like I got rolled for this. This could send me home very easily. Just being confident when, you know there's no reason to be confident. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything, whether it was physical or mental or spiritual, that's in addition you thing got you through this BUDS experience in general? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say what I get from my girlfriend. Just that, you have a really strong relationship. Just being able to be like, OK, today was a bad day today sucked and if I can look forward to calling her and, you know, almost in a way like you're a baby a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's kind of nice, almost even though, like, you know, we're all like whatever tough guys, I guess. But it's nice to be babied sometimes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Where is she? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's in Florida. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it's been all long distance for a while. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, anytime you had to make a difficult decision here at BUDS like a ethical and moral decision, whether it was personal or watching somebody else maybe do something that wasn't enough. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, for sure. There's definitely like for a lot of ways that you can cheat here at BUDS like. And it's a lot of things like you have to be the man and be like, OK, I'm going to consciously make a decision not to do that. Like especially like staying out after curfew. I know like, and lying about certain things. Like here's one of the circumstances I'm not gonna name anything in particular. He's still actually in the program. And he had lied to one of the instructions about not having a vehicle when they were doing vehicle inspections. You know, he was my roommate at the time. And so I knew about it. And I did tell him either you're going to, like, say something and he had some contraband hidden in his car so I did like to tell the officers in the class, which I mean, like there's there's a certain point where it's like, okay, are you just kind of protecting the bad guys? Like yeah. You might have made it past Hell Week but or are you just harboring guys? Are you trying to protect those guys? Are you actually trying to do the right thing? Even if they did make it through Hell Week or whatever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So do you feel like was that a struggle to kind of decide what to do or do you feel like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot really. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the hardest thing was like confronting people because I'm such like I'm an easygoing guy. It's hard for me to sometimes talk about things that carry weight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I'm not. I don't have a hard time being serious at work. But it's like, okay, I'm confronting this guy, so you go about differently. I mean, face to face it's a little bit harder. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality of it. Why do you think you were successful in completing BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I don't know. Like finishing BUDS and being like successful, like conquering it. I feel are different in my mind. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI struggled a lot. I told a lot of the instructors they were like, oh, good on you like making it through at 18 and I'm like, man, I. I was such a wuss at so many different things. I wish in hindsight I should have waited probably. But maybe just like I just never thought about quitting as an option. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's really clich\u00e9 to say but. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy was quitting not an option for you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust because the guys are here and they're doing it like like why can't I? Like I don't want to let them down. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother big thing and like, this is something I want to do. I really don't have to good of an answer for that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo it's ok What are the, what do you think the differences between the people who have made it and the people that did quit, specifically the ones that quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. um, so I think a lot of guys and I know this is not for everyone, but they lose desire for it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr they didn't have the desire in the first place. Like, I know a lot of guys who had gotten rolled twice or once in they're like in that in-between period when you're not in it for a long time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can lose desire for what you're doing. I know like getting rolled, I had to like reignite that flame. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd uh, but I know a lot of guys who. Also switching ideas, guys who didn't even want to do the job in the first place. A lot of guys just want to be a SEAL and not really do job because it is pretty. I mean, the further you go on you realize that it's so much more then. It's harder then, then just making it through Hell Week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, there's a lot more to it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how has this experience changed you as a person? If at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like it's like coming into being a homeschooler, like kind of not being sheltered, like living in my own bubble. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's definitely blinded my. My world view of like. Meaning so many different people. That helps me. Discern like, because I have beliefs and what I believe. And then, like, it's kind of putting that to the test. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my own. You know, a lot of people can get swept away and like kind of just become an imprint of what their environment is. And so being able to stay alone. What you believe? Not even what you grew up believing but what you believe it's right. I didn't know that. It kinda was is a big lesson I had to learn. Be my own person not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing totally. Because there's a lot of peer pressure in life and decide that and grow up and be like yo, this what I'm about. This is what I'm about to do. This is what going to do. I think a lot of guys can respect me for that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust because, you know, even though I am really young. They see like. Ok he's about this. Even though they may not agree with it. They can still respect it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you think um because were you homeschooled your whole life? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most of my life, I went to private Christian school for a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think um that really played a role on that being kinda your own human being? Person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA little bit. I mean, I was definitely like not a troublemaker. Definitely not a troublemaker. I just kinda like kinda do my own thing. Like free spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha um anything else that I didn't ask, do you think he may help us with this study? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not very qualified to talk about any of this, actually. I. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo you're great. You're perfectly qualified. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm just here because I don't know it's lot of luck too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think someone said I'm sure a lot have. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. A lot of people say that. Yeah. Ok well great I'm finished. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you. Congratulations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.

daily basis\r\n\r\n74: I think my family for sure \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n74: uh and uh definitely like not letting these guys down I think being like being a part of a team like that\u2019s been such a constant in my life since the fourth grade when I started sports \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: it\u2019s just so the better you do the better everyone does and uh just being driven by that like I live with guys and one of them is going to workout after this and now I\u2019m going so it\u2019s just like trying to get better and just competitions\r\n\r\nA: like competition and peer pressure in a good way\r\n\r\n74: ya I think competition are like ya ya I think peer Ya positive peer pressure\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: which is stimulated by this kind of environment\r\n\r\nA: what was the most challenging part of buds so think about buds was there a day or an event where you were just like really\r\n\r\n74: I hated the uh the uniform inspections the most cause I was like probably gonna fail and uh that was just like a shot to the heart cause you would spend so much time and you just ya I didn\u2019t like those but all the physical stuff was particularly bad and like we went through like a summer class so it wasn\u2019t like that cold so you gotta get to the guys who are going through first phase now it\u2019s really cold\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74:  but no I thought uniform I hated that stuff cause you spent so much time \r\n\r\nA: what motivated you to push through it when things were hard\r\n\r\n74: like the uniform inspections specifically\r\n\r\nA: like really hard right where you felt yourself maybe having doubts or  \r\n\r\n74: I think like the legacy like there's never been a navy lacrosse player to quit buds so I wasn't gonna be the first apparently uh there's more like asterisks but it's kinda like medical type thing um so like um so like as I was told before going in so like you don\u2019t wanna be  that guy right then um one of my classmates uh told me this one thing uh it\u2019s like you so when you quit you put your helmet on the grinder right so your your name is on the ground so\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: so your putting your name like down in the dirt \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: and I\u2019m like I\u2019m not gonna let that \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: I don\u2019t want like your name to be associated with a quitter\r\n\r\nA: family name um helmet\r\n\r\n74: ya which gets put on the grinder and everyone walks by they are like dang they are literally looking down at it right\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74:  it's like a symbolic thing for me and I\u2019m not gonna let that happen\r\n\r\nA: ya are there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used to push through the challenges pray meditate \r\n\r\n74: I\u2019m not really religious but I pray ummm \r\n\r\nA:how about like you know being an athlete or rituals or workouts or games like the that get you ready physically ready and mentally\r\n\r\n74: I would like eat sing and get breakfast every morning \r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n74: every morning I had a frosted mini wheats and watermelon\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n74: and watermelon and I had a good day one day like the first day so I was like this must be the reason why  \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n74: and so I like every day that we had breakfast in buds I had a and besides that i don't know I\u2019m pretty ritualistic or superstitious oh like like uh I wore like I wore like the same shirt a lot or like uh someone had a good idea was like every not first phase in first phase I got fifteen shirts right because they were work days and I\u2019d just throw white shirt out at the end of the day and I\u2019d start each day with a  fresh white shirt  \r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n74: just stuff like that i guess but like by uh like in second phase you have all the pool comp stuff so I\u2019d wear the same brown shirt everyday till I like failed and then switch it and start a new one and then in third phase which sounds gross but I mean it is kinda gross and  but then in third phase I did that same thing too it\u2019s like I\u2019d pass one qual and I\u2019d just keep wearing the same shirt till I passed the next one and then changed eventually but things were going good so if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it right\r\n\r\nA: ok when you made a difficult, can you think of a difficult decision you made during training and what went through your mind as you made that decision so can you give me an example of a tough decision and I know you don\u2019t make many decisions for yourself when you\u2019re at buds but\r\n\r\n74: ya \r\n\r\nA: were there any \r\n\r\n74:um \r\n\r\nA: that you can think of \r\n\r\n74:I think like the peer ranking were difficult decisions I actually did make one there was a guy in my uh I\u2019m not sure if I did the right thing or not but there was a really young guy in our in our group group he was like 19 fresh out of high school he was an absolute stud of a performer but like super immature like uh we told him that before and it\u2019s kinda getting out of hand with like talking saying things at inappropriate times like he\u2019ll make really really bad and I was his fireteam leader and I put him in my bottom five and I wrote in there I don't think he\u2019s a bad performer and I think he should be here but I think he needs to have a tough conversation about maturity right but then like everyone knows who the bottom five are right and I was talking to one of the instructors he came up and I talked out it and kinda publicly shamed the guy when I coulda taken more of a mentor role and so that\u2019ll be a tough decision that I made that didn\u2019t end up working out and made me kinda like ok maybe I shoulda tried harder but here is one way in buds when I coulda been an officer so after that I shifted tried to be more of a mentor role cause I was like six years older than the guy and it ended up working out\r\n\r\nA: so the decision you made was to use the \r\n\r\n74: use the box\r\n\r\nA: use the ranking system\r\n\r\n74: yes when and I put the disclaimer in there like hey I don;t think he\u2019s a bad performer but ya so that would be a tough decision I made that ended up teaching me something about like that peer relationships or something that you can do rather than publicly shame somebody \r\n\r\nA: ok so what went through your mind when you made that decision when you used the formal peer ranking as the tool \r\n\r\n74:um I didn\u2019t feel comfortable going up to the instructors saying hey can you go and talk to this guy \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n74: the I realized that would have been much much better than just like writing a little blurb on the hey I don\u2019t think he's actually that bad you know um \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n74: so I think that would have been so that's where I learned like maybe I think I was hiding behind it a little bit cause I didn't really know exactly what to do so I chose the easy the less comfortable option\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: so (long pause)   \r\n\r\nA: ok um why do you think you were successful why do you think you were successful getting through buds\r\n\r\n74: uh \r\n\r\nA: and why do you think others did not make it \r\n\r\n74: I think I have like a really really strong support system coming from my family friends and then uh guys I was really close with out here like I mean I lived with five other four other O\u2019s who were all in my class so I knew a bunch of dudes I think I had a lot of reasons to be here and I didn't really have another option I think that was it like we were doing this or like going to the fleet like I can\u2019t and not like coming back and I think like I just wanted it for a long time\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n74: ok I don;t know I wasn\u2019t but ya I think the support system was huge \r\n\r\nA: ok did you notice anything different about those that didn\u2019t make it\r\n\r\n74: ya \r\n\r\nA: there trends \r\n\r\n74: ya I think guys didn\u2019t make it but have a plan b um ya I think a lot of people did or or they started looking for them and you have a bad day and it\u2019s not really that bad right something like that right \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n74: you know for us it\u2019ll be like you know what would suck right now the bridge you know that would suck you know I\u2019m cold but at least I\u2019m not standing a four hour watch on the the fucking aft you know look out you know what i mean I\u2019d say something like tha but uh \r\n\r\nA:ya ok anything else?\r\n\r\n74: no you kinda hear the same stuff uh oh it's just not for me so I respect the guys that realize that what what is worse is the people who know it\u2019s not for them but don\u2019t want to quit and drag the other guys down I thought that was I had no respect for those guys but the guys who were man enough to just say hey this this is not for me like I\u2019m out like no no ill will towards those guys but ya its the ones who like and like you hear people say some people say I know I\u2019m not performing but I'm not quitting\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: it\u2019s like you\u2019re you\u2019re old prune but you\u2019re one sixth of this and it\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t matter if you do that in second phase like you you\u2019re by yourself right \r\n\r\nA: ya\r\n\r\n74: first phase its like all team \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n74: so its like that pisses me off and then they would get rolled or dropped or whatever but I don't feel bad for them because they aren\u2019t a good teammate\r\n\r\nA: alright did this experience at buds change you\r\n\r\n74: I\u2019d say so um confidence I think uh cause there was a lot of things that a lot of question marks a lot of like gut checks that you have to pass to get through and it\u2019s like well I\u2019ve done this so I can do that so I\u2019m looking forward to the next challenge it\u2019s more academic its JOTC so its like going to school again but no I think that that would be the things ya it\u2019s just you have that \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n74:tool belt I remember ya \r\n\r\nA: uh is there anything else that we didn\u2019t talk about that you want to share anything that you think would be helpful for the research team anything you think we should be asking \r\n\r\n74: no I think you guys pretty much covered it all ya I can\u2019t really think of anything\r\n\r\nA: ok awesome I\u2019ll turn this off \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Quinn Greenheck\r\n\r\nDate:27 Jan 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 79\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in

contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n79: I think so as BUD/S went on umm\r\n\r\nA: ya, do you think your personality contributed?\r\n\r\n79: yes ya I think so the like put in the like

to\r\n\r\nA: Ok\r\n\r\n79: so that was probably like my original interest in the Navy\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: I guess and then Captain Duncan Smith, he is like a family friend and he was in the teams\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: and he was kinda the reason I wanted to go down this path\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: um and just and his one of his sons is also in the teams and like I spent like a lot of time at their house over the summer and that kinda just like seeing the way he was kinda uhh\r\n\r\nA: So would you say you were exposed to it early?\r\n\r\n79: yes\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: err no so

soap in mouth\r\n\r\nA: ok really ok\r\n\r\n79: mainly the soap when my mom was mad\r\n\r\nA: really, ok, and then how about you teenage years, so did you move around a lot, did you\r\n\r\n79: no so I lived in Moscow for two years  \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: and then Huston for two years and then uhh I\u2019ve been in Michigan the rest of the time so I pretty much grew up in Michigan uhh  \r\n\r\nA: were you \r\n\r\n79: the other \r\n\r\nA: how old were you when you were in Moscow\r\n\r\n79: uhh From when I was born till about like two years old\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: and then two to four in Huston \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: and then Michigan for the rest \r\n\r\nA: ok great, did you participate in uh any team sports when you were younger\r\n\r\n79:  yes, so I played pretty much, my parents got me involved in like every sport so I\u2019d always be doing something \r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n79: and one of my brothers the closest one would just like be on the team with me even though he wasn\u2019t necessarily old enough so we were always doin something going sport to sport  \r\n\r\nA: ok and then \r\n\r\n79: staying busy \r\n\r\nA: like landed on hockey\r\n\r\n79: hockey was like my main \r\n\r\nA: and then you played at uh USNA \r\n\r\n79: yes \r\n\r\nA: which was a D1 program?\r\n\r\n79: their a club team \r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n79: yep ya \r\n\r\nA: ok great umm what have you done is the last five years of your life prior to BUD/s and would you consider um the like any of that to be uh relevant to your experience here? \r\n\r\n79: umm so with the Naval Academy I guess that helped with leadership like team aspect and everything, getting different exposure to different communities and just like seeing where I didn\u2019t want to be and where I\u2019m interested in umm how about that   \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: is that \r\n\r\nA: so like summer training at the academy \r\n\r\n79: yes um so I guess SOAS helped \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n79: get exposure to it \r\n\r\nA: great, what motivates you on a daily basis\r\n\r\n79: just getting just getting better and seeing other guys who are better than me makes me kinda want to push myself to be the best that you can be \r\n\r\nA: inspired by others\r\n\r\n79: yes\r\n\r\nA: Great, what was the most challenging component of BUD/s uh and this is like a big picture question it could be a specific event or a day or   \r\n\r\n79: um \r\n\r\nA: um \r\n\r\n79: probably the first day of first phase or I\u2019d say that um the the the uh first it\u2019s like uh barracks inspections  \r\n\r\nA: yep \r\n\r\n79: that was ya \r\n\r\nA: ok what motivated you to push through it \r\n\r\n79: uh just telling myself not to be like uh just the idea of having to call my parents after that and my brothers and stuff and just telling myself I wasn\u2019t soft thats it\r\n\r\nA: ok so positive self talk or negative self talk\r\n\r\n79: yes uh I well what would that be considered\r\n\r\nA: i don\u2019t know\r\n\r\n79:uh\r\n\r\nA: depends on the narrative in your head, like saying I can do this like \r\n\r\n79: no like so \r\n\r\nA: or are you like \r\n\r\n79: it\u2019s more like don\u2019t be like \r\n\r\nA: be weak\r\n\r\n79: ya be weak \r\n\r\nA: um \r\n\r\n79:um\r\n\r\nA: and then do you feel like you were supported by the group\r\n\r\n79: yes and I think that uh what motivated me so being with the same group of guys that came out from the academy with here \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: like being with them every day helped a lot like seeing them go through the same stuff not wanting to let them down kinda thing\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: pretty much not wanting to let them down was probably the biggest motivation piece \r\n\r\nA: ok ya were there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\n79: other then just like getting\r\n\r\nA: purp meditation like a stretching routine\r\n\r\n79:no other than just like preparing before and working out and stuff nothing specific on that one \r\n\r\nA: when you made a difficult decision during training BUD/s what went through your mind as you made that decision, can you provide an example?  \r\n\r\n79: umm (long pause) uh I got really nothing sorry\r\n\r\nA: ok Would you consider yourself impulsive for example do you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n79: I do not have any tattoos um but yes I would say impulsive I guess uh I\u2019m just \r\n\r\nA: not not\r\n\r\n79: no no i am \r\n\r\nA: oh ya \r\n\r\n79: sort of \r\n\r\nA: Do ah you have speeding tickets? or\r\n\r\n79: no\r\n\r\nA: ok spontaneous\r\n\r\n79: spontaneous I guess ya just kinda if someone says their doing something randomly i\u2019d be like ok ya  \r\n\r\nA: is that layed back or is it \r\n\r\n79: ya \r\n\r\nA: impulsive implies you would just um  \r\n\r\n79: go and straight\r\n\r\nA: doing things on a whim like oh lets go get a tattoo \r\n\r\n79: oh ya alright probably not like super\r\n\r\nA: ok so not impulsive but spontaneous ok um when you made a difficult decision ok we already talked about that, no difficult decision\r\n\r\n79: I can\u2019t really think it\u2019s kinda all just a blur\r\n\r\nA: ok why do you think you were successful in completing bud/s so why were you successful and why do you think others didn\u2019t complete\r\n\r\n79: um preparation I think\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79:a big one \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n79:coming from the academy I kinda think we have an advantage form the start because compared to the enlisted guys we have all the prior knowledge about it and knowing people that have gone through the same thing beforehand kinda get their experience from it and can learn from that\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n79: and then also just I think I\u2019m very not necessarily stubborn but I don\u2019t like if I;m gonna do something I don\u2019t want to quit on it I guess so \r\n\r\nA: can I use the word tenacious you know what that means?\r\n\r\n79: uhh not really\r\n\r\nA: um it\u2019s like you don\u2019t quit\r\n\r\n79:ok \r\n\r\nA: right \r\n\r\n79: ya ya \r\n\r\nA: so I like your word stubborn i\u2019m gonna write that down and then I\u2019m gonna write tenacious, ok did you notice anything about people that didn\u2019t make it? What would you say? \r\n\r\n79: I think so not like having their heart kind of in it if their just kinda doing it on a whim I think that those like a lot of those guys quit umm some of it\u2019s probably luck but I think most of it is just I think the majority of people that quit they make the decision ahead that they are gonna quit I think it\u2019s more mental than physical \r\n\r\nA: ok so you don\u2019t think it was a lack of their physical strength \r\n\r\n79: cause all all in around had I think  \r\n\r\nA: umm\r\n\r\n79: for for mentoring \r\n\r\nA: uh ya how did this experience change you as a person \r\n\r\n79: um it makes you realize things are not that bad I guess but the majority of the time and that you can push through like a lot more than you think you could  \r\n\r\nA: so you think that boosts your confidence\r\n\r\n79: ya ya you are more confident doing normal tasks or that you\u2019re someone\u2019s asking you to do something that you don\u2019t think\u2019s possible you\u2019re like oh that\u2019s not that hard\r\n\r\nA: ok great anything else that you\u2019d like to share that I didn\u2019t ask, ok great, thanks so much. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: MCVICKERS\r\n\r\nDate: 12 AUG 20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 85\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 20:03\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it OK if I record the interview?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nWhat is your ID number?\r\n\r\n85. \r\n\r\nOK easy questions first, when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI started BUD/S I believe in June, June of 2019.\r\n\r\nAnd that was with 338?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nHow did you end up in 339?\r\n\r\nI ended up in 339 when I failed to meet the standard on a pistol qualification. \r\n\r\nOK so in Third Phase?\r\n\r\nYes, Third Phase. \r\n\r\nWe will come back and talk about that. Tell me about family life, how many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nUh I have one brother and one sister. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the birth order?\r\n\r\nMy brother was born first in 1995 I was born in 1997 and my sister was born in 2000. \r\n\r\nOK so you\u2019re the second child?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nWhat is your parent situation? Two parent household?\r\n\r\nTwo parent household. \r\n\r\nAre those your birth parents?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with your parents like?\r\n\r\nGreat I talk to them often, had kind of a normal suburban middle class lifestyle. \r\n\r\nWhere did you grow up?\r\n\r\nSt. Louis.\r\n\r\nDid you move around at all?\r\n\r\nAlways in the same place. \r\n\r\nAny life changing events before you came to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nNot really I lived a fairly normal life in the suburbs, went to public school and then went to college. \r\n\r\nWhere\u2019d you go to college?\r\n\r\nI went to Iowa State University.\r\n\r\nAnd you did four years there?\r\n\r\nYes, I graduated in 3.5 years.\r\n\r\nDid you go straight into the military after that?\r\n\r\nI was in bootcamp two months later. \r\n\r\nOCS or enlisted?\r\n\r\nEnlisted.\r\n\r\nAnything that you think factored into your experiences here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh my family always \u2026 sports \u2026 we were always pushed if you\u2019re going to do something do it right. My dad was an engineer went to MIT, my older brother does very very good in school and is an investment banker now. We were always told to go for absolutely everything if we were going to do something. That was big in our house, out in the backyard we were very very active as kids and the way my dad pushed us we did very well in school but I just wanted to take a different path and be a part of something greater. \r\n\r\nDid you always want to be a SEAL or was that later on in life?\r\n\r\nUh\u2026 at 17 I originally wanted to but I don\u2019t think I had the maturity and physicality to do it so I decided to go through college and kind of reassess later. And towards the end of college I decided that I wanted to do it. I didn\u2019t really look at any other unit or any other place in the military besides this. \r\n\r\nIs there anybody in your family that made you want to go Special Forces?\r\n\r\nUh \u2026 I actually found out later my dad was also thinking about being a SEAL back before his love of engineering kind of took over. But uh I don\u2019t know we were always kind of pushed to do like the best so I knew I wanted to do something with Special Operations you know because they\u2019re special. And that\u2019s when I found that the SEALs were the best of the best. \r\n\r\nTell me a little bit about your personality and how you think that might have contributed to getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm I don\u2019t know I really like being active I like being on my feet and doing something physically challenging that\u2019s what gives me the most satisfaction and doing it and like being a part of something greater, doing it as part of a team and \u2026 doing drills or whatnot and doing them right. It\u2019s really cool to be a part of a community that is constantly trying to make you better. \u2026 I don\u2019t know there\u2019s not anything to complain \u2026 especially when you get to this point now (unintelligible).  \r\n\r\nAny military in your family that directed you towards Navy?\r\n\r\nUh I had to uncles in the Air Force and my grandfather was in the Army but nothing really like my parents weren\u2019t in the military \u2026 nothing really around this realm. \r\n\r\nAny friends that were going into the military?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nFrom what point were you when you decided to join the military?\r\n\r\nLike I said when I was 17 I decided I wanted to do something a little more active. I wanted to do it then but then next thing I went to college and then I might want to do something with law enforcement. I always knew I wanted to do something active it was just whether it was the military or what. January 2018 was when I actually joined. \r\n\r\nAnything that was the final switch?\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see \u2026 an internship opportunity kind of fell through so I knew that uh I knew that it was going to be nearly impossible to do law enforcement that and its also impossible to get into right out of college without experience and I\u2019m like alright I\u2019ll do something else cool and I\u2019m like alright I\u2019m going to do this at least for a number of years\r\n\r\nTell me about your childhood, parents parenting style, were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\nUm I was a kid that went to Sunday school every Sunday. We were \u2026 were were pretty well behaved kids we didn\u2019t do anything really stupid. Yeah we had our friends and you know went ... I don\u2019t know it was a pretty normal upper middle class suburbs life. I can\u2019t think of a time that my parents had to really like come down hard on us \u2026 they disciplined us whenever we did something bad as a kid but we never did anything really stupid. \r\n\r\nAnd what was discipline like? Timeouts, spanking, etc. \r\n\r\nYeah we got spanked but that was about it. \r\n\r\nNothing that stands out?\r\n\r\nNo not really. \r\n\r\nWhat about your teenage years, did you play sports?\r\n\r\nI played hockey for ten years \u2026 baseball for nine \u2026 and football for three years in high school. And I played volleyball too when I was in college. Track too, but for football the bond with the guys too was so much more. I played ten years of hockey but in three years of football I felt much more of a bond with the guys. \r\n\r\nWas that just the dynamic of the team or the sport in general?\r\n\r\nI mean we were a winning team but I don\u2019t know the guys were just always \u2026 we would have fun and \u2026 I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t really describe it the guys were just really good. We were a winning team so that helped winning so much we were able to just relax sometimes. \r\n\r\nHow do you think being a part of those sports contributed to your experience as BUD/S?\r\n\r\nKnowing that guys went through the same thing or guys working together to achieve the greater goal and \u2026 just being around like minded individuals. \r\n\r\nIn the five years leading up to BUD/S you went to college, straight out of college you did boot camp. Anything else you were doing?\r\n\r\nI mean I was lifting, working out, living a healthy lifestyle. I participated in intramural sports um I was in a fraternity in college \u2026 that was kind of like a little bit of that brotherhood aspect but not nearly as much as here. Yeah just went to college and lived the college lifestyle and had fun but that\u2019s kind of why I graduated in 3.5 years you know I did everything that I wanted to and there wasn\u2019t much left for me. \r\n\r\nWhat about do you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\nImpulsive\u2026 um \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say so. \r\n\r\nAny tattoos, speeding tickets, purchases without really thinking about it?\r\n\r\nNo not really. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?\r\n\r\n\u2026 I would say First Phase daily grind.\r\n\r\nAnd why is that?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not one evolution that gets people but uh \u2026 First Phase it\u2019s just five days a week you\u2019re getting destroyed and uh guys think too far ahead. Like I said it\u2019s not one evolution that gets somebody its thinking too far ahead you know they\u2019re not taking it one step at a time.\r\n\r\nWas that your method of getting through it? Just one step at a time?\r\n\r\nI had my own motivation that I knew I needed to make it through BUD/S.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you in general to get through?\r\n\r\nI \u2026 I just knew there was no way in hell I was going to quit. \r\n\r\nSo what about getting rolled in Third Phase? What motivated you to get through after that roll?\r\n\r\nUm I took a step back to look at the bigger picture uh there were guys who had been rolled who had been to Hell Week and had been sent back to BO and I\u2019m here already in Third Phase so it kind of makes you appreciate you know what\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just seven weeks of your life. It\u2019s not that long it\u2019s not a big deal. What motivated me to get through was its not that big of a deal. You know its stupid things but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. A Third Phase roll it\u2019s not that bad. There are much worse things if you get rolled all the way back. \r\n\r\nSo it\u2019s just keeping things in perspective?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\nAnything physical, mental, or spiritual that you utilized to push through any challenges here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\u2026 um \u2026 spiritual I would say so. That\u2019s part of the reason why I\u2019m here and why I didn\u2019t get hurt you know that\u2019s \u2026 sometimes people say that BUD/S is just about getting lucky and not getting hurt. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s luck I would say \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say I was more protected than others but I think I had someone watching over me. There were some things that I could have very easily gotten hurt on but somehow someway I didn\u2019t. Physical \u2026 yeah I think we all workout I think we\u2019re all in pretty good shape because you know just to get into First Phase we\u2019re far surpassing numbers for O-Course and for runs. You know for me it was uh the second I think the times were getting tough I think I missed that evolution uh knowing that it\u2019s not going to last that long I know everything is regulated \u2026 I know they\u2019re not going to do something stupid to where \u2026 as it went on it became more relaxed and I think that changed our perspective on the weeks. Two and a half hard weeks of first phase and then things start to taper off and then you go through Hell Week. Then after that things get a lot smoother so it was just putting it in perspective that I can make it through the 2.5 weeks \u2026 so it was just segmenting. Especially in Hell Week I really segmented the days.\r\n\r\nSo your segments were by day, hour, minute?\r\n\r\nI did all three of them. If I was getting beat down for a personnel inspection I would do it by minutes or by hour. Somehow if I could find out what the time was and we only have twenty more minutes that\u2019s not a big deal just twenty minutes. Uh when I lay my head down at night I knew I only had this many days left. So like I said I didn\u2019t overstress time but I would just take it minute by minute and hour by hour. \r\n\r\nWhat about any time you had to make a difficult decision, moral or ethical, whether you personal or seeing someone else do something and you have to decide?\r\n\r\n\u2026 I can\u2019t really think of anything\u2026 Yeah nothing comes to mind. \r\n\r\nAnytime someone was taking a short cut?\r\n\r\nNo not really. \r\n\r\nWhy do you think that you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\u2026 It\u2019s just \u2026 I chose to keep going \u2026 and also putting others before yourself\u2026 and after Hell Week you start doing things that you somewhat like doing \u2026 So even lifesaving and going head to head with an instructor underwater \u2026 I found that fun. You know you're either aggressive or you start doing things that you like. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think the difference is between people who made it and specifically people who quit?\r\n\r\n\u2026 At least from the guys that started First Phase because there\u2019s some guys who started BO who just couldn\u2019t pass a run or \u2026 but starting First Phase you see the guys who can physically make it but the guys who you see that there\u2019s just nothing that can make them quit. \r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n\u2026 Um humility. It\u2019s hard at times. \r\n\r\nAnything else that I didn\u2019t ask that I should have?\r\n\r\nNot really, its just mental. Everybody here is physically capable but the difference between us and the helmets on the grinder is there is nothing they could do to get us out of here. \r\n\r\nOK well we\u2019re all done. Congratulations.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 21 JAN 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 93\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Deirdre Dixon\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok, so what\u2019s your number? \r\n\r\n#93: 93\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, is it OK if I record?\r\n\r\n#93: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, just tell me about how many siblings you have and like what\u2019s your birth order?\r\n\r\n#93: I have three siblings. I\u2019m the oldest of them all. Uh, I have two younger sisters and a younger brother. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, think about your life experiences, and what do you, what would you describe as a crucible event, or something that really shaped your life?\r\n\r\n#93: Probably uhh, my parents being divorced, uh kinda led to uh I had to uh I that uh live with my mom and I wasn\u2019t too fond of that idea because I was really close to my dad, and I eventually got the age where I was able to choose which house I wanted to go to and I went to my dads and it was really good for me because my dads side of the family is really just uhm, really close and really family oriented, and all their values and morals just like got uh passed on to me and I was just uh really grateful for them. My grandparents were very supportive and involved in my life, along with my sister. It was really good, you know.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, how do you think those experiences factored into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#93: Just coming from a, coming from a good background, I guess uhm I grew up in church and I would always fall back on God when things got really uh difficult, and uhm just like being raised up that household and my grandmother is a prayer warrior. She is like my number one supporter and anything I ever did she would just like, supported me no matter what it was and I just didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. So I think that kinda like was a driving force behind me.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So tell me about how you think your personality helped you through BUD/S. Is there anything about your personality that you think made you successful?\r\n\r\n#93: I don\u2019t know, maybe being, being quiet and reserved. If I had to pick anything, uhm I\u2019m kinda quiet. It takes me a while to warm up to some people. But when I do, its uhm, I open up a lot and get really close with some of the guys in, but the first, going through first phase and basic orientation, I was just knda to myself alot, and kinda watched things happen, uhm I just kinda like formed my opinion and took things as they came at me. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what motivated you to push through? Like did you feel supported by the group? Even though you weren\u2019t close? Or what?\r\n\r\n#93: Somewhat, yeah . Whenever we\u2019d do you know just really hard evolutions, the boat crew would just come together and uhm you know drive one another and motivate each other. Something that\u2019s a really cool aspect about it, is guys you barely know, you get put through this crucible, and it somehow brings you closer, because you all are all uh experiencing and feeling the same kind of effects and pain. Uhm there\u2019s just kinda no way around it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uhm, what would you say, what practices, helped you get through, push through, like spiritual, mental, physical? What did you do? Did you have anything specific that you did when it was a really hard time?\r\n\r\n#93: I would say a little prayer in my head, uhm, that think that, looking back on it, and in the moment, it really helped me. As far as mental things go, I just tried to take, take things as they came and like, you know one evolution at a time, and I didnt think too far ahead, I just kinda went with the flow of things and I tried not to overthink a lot of it and that really helped keep a level head.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, can you think of a time when you had a difficult decision to make during training and what went through your mind during that decision?\r\n\r\n#93: A difficult decision? Uhm.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And if you can\u2019t think of anything that\u2019s fine. Not everybody has decisions they have to make.\r\n\r\n#93: Uhm, nothing really comes to mind.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Why do you think that you were successful in completing BUD/s? There\u2019s a lot of people that started with your class, and you're making it here, you made it, you got your trident, you know what made you successful?\r\n\r\n#93: Uhm, I don\u2019t know I guess just like living it day by day and just like I was saying earlier, not, not thinking too far ahead, not overthinking things, just tried to remain calm whenever things were chaotic, and I just knew that there was a lot of talk and I knew it wasn\u2019t always gonna suck, for lack of a better word. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok so let me ask you this, did you notice anything different about the people that didn\u2019t make it? Like what made someone quit and you were able to stick it out?\r\n\r\n#93: Not believing in themselves. If I had to give anybody any advice, who quit and wanted to come back or somebody who wanted to try the program out, I\u2019d say just to believe in themselves because there was a lot of times where I doubted myself, even prior to coming, I was really nervous about it, and it gave me butterflies I just couldn\u2019t get rid of, but it just all came back to believing in yourself and believing in what you're doing and just believing that this is what I truly wanted to come here and do. And, I think that helped me and the guys that had doubts.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok what about, what, what, part of your background led you to even being a SEAL in the first place?\r\n\r\n#93: Like made me want to do this?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah what made you want to do it?\r\n\r\n#93: Uhm, like I was a little kid, and I had this game system, the Playstation One, and there was this game called the SOCOM US Navy SEALs. It kinda planted this seed. I always grew up uhh living like the outdoors lifestyle, hunting, fishing, and shooting guns. The idea of being in the military appealed to me, and even more so like being in special ops and stuff. Uhh and as I got older, I got more interested in it and did my research and always came back to the navy and the navy seals. Yeah i just really liked the idea of it being considered one of the hardest things to do.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your childhood like when you did something wrong at home, how did your parents discipline you?  And it might have been different for your mom and your dad if you lived in two different houses. How did that work? Like if you did something wrong, what did your mom do? What did your dad do?\r\n\r\n#93: Typically get a whooping. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok.\r\n\r\n#93: My mom didn\u2019t really like to do that all too much. I mean neither of my parents you know enjoyed discipling a child in that way you know but when it came to it and I needed it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: A lot of people do that, so what about when you were a teenager, like anything big like did you move around, did you play any sports? Like what kinda formed you?\r\n\r\n#93: I grew up playing baseball for a lot of my youth and I moved around a few times when I lived with my mom and once I finally got the choice of moving in with my dad I kinda grounded in one spot and stayed in the same school for the entirety of my uhh time as a student going through high school and middle school and I ran a couple years of cross country and uh cross country and track in high school.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Tell me about those team oriented things. What did you think about that? Did you feel like it was a tight community? Was it everyone for themselves?\r\n\r\n#93: It was uhh, our team was very tight. An uh, it was just because our coach was just like absolutely phenomenal. He devoted so much time and effort and multiple hours before work and after work just to our team and making sure everything was taken care of and uh he made sure that there was no animosity between different players, or uh teammates on the team.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, how bout, so what was your life like in the past five years before you came to BUD/S? Did you go to high school then go straight to boot camp? Like what was your sequence?\r\n\r\n#93: Umm I went to high school. Graduated in 2018. I spent those four years kinda figuring out what I wanted to do with my life and I was kinda bouncing back and forth between going to school and doing a trade and coming to the military and finally boiled it down to joining the Navy. Now, that\u2019s part of the reason why I joined uh cross country, was to get in shape, get in good shape, and it\u2019s led to even greater things. I got really close and tight with the boys on the team and I still keep in touch with a lot of them. My best friend, uh was on the, was on the team and he continued on with his career running into college and uhh yeah that was. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, did you join the Navy specifically to be a SEAL?\r\n\r\n#93: Yes ma\u2019am. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So did you go straight from boot camp, do they call it that in the navy? Boot camp?\r\n\r\n#93: Yes ma\u2019am.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok, so did you go straight from boot camp to come here?\r\n\r\n#93: I did. So I went straight to boot camp, and after two months of that, I went to BUD/S prep which is like uhh, a preparatory school for, for BUD/S, uhm swimming, running, and lifting. Stuff like that. And then I came straight here. So it was like a pretty straight forward process.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#93: Uhm just being a part of this community, and my family.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Think about your hardest day at BUD/S. What was the most challenging part? And then, uhm what was that? And then, uh what motivated you to keep going?\r\n\r\n#93: There\u2019s been a lot of lows. Uhm I don\u2019t think I have one specific day in mind, but there\u2019s a few moments during hellweek that were like really, really hard to like uhh push past that mental barrier of just like realizing that I had a few more days left of this kind of treatment and uhm, like I said before, it\u2019s just like saying a little prayer in my head and just knowing that it will be over eventually just really helped me during those hard times. Even throughout BUD/S, not just hellweek specifically.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uhm, how did the whole experience of BUD/S change you as a person?\r\n\r\n#93: Thats a good question, uhm.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Or did it?\r\n\r\n#93: It did. It did. Uhm, to be more confident in myself and to believe I\u2019m, I\u2019m capable of what I think I\u2019m not capable of, and. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok.\r\n\r\n#93: I try to yeah, that\u2019s a hard question.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: It is.\r\n\r\n#93: I\u2019d have to sit on that for a little bit to uh.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok well I got one more for you. What, so we\u2019re asking this on behalf of SOCOM, to help the next group. What should I have asked you that would have given me, that I didn\u2019t ask you, that might help me give more insight to people who want to come to BUD/S. Anything you can think of?\r\n\r\n#93: The question of like why, \u201cwhat made you want to do this?\u201d\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhmm.\r\n\r\n#93: Because, I think you need a really, you need a really good reason to come here and take on this training. It can\u2019t just be because you know, cause it\u2019s cool, or cause uh, I don\u2019t know. You have to have something to always fall back on. Because, when things get really hard and you don\u2019t have like a solid reason of why you want to do this, it\u2019d just be as easy as, just as easy as that to just quit.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well, that\u2019s all I have, congratulations. I really appreciate your staying here and talking to me.\r\n\r\n#93: Thank you for taking the time.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, it\u2019s awesome.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jake Rude\r\n\r\nDate:\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 94\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI: I am going to have to sit really close to you, so I can hear all your responses.

Maybe I saw a poster in the recruiter office or uhh\u2026 I don\u2019t really remember exactly what made me like take that PST to get that all started in the first place, but nothing like, uhm a lot of guys had been wanting to do this since they were like really little and like not me\u2026 really.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, and what age do you think you were like okay this direction?\r\n\r\nP: Probably around college probably like uhh\u2026\r\n\r\nI: 18s\u2026.early 20s?\r\n\r\nP: Like 20, 21.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah.

It was more like a suburb mixed with like uhh we had like an area that was uhm very ethnic I guess.\r\n\r\nI: Okay, what about your parents parenting style. How would you describe that?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm my mom\u2019s probably the sweetest person in the world.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah..\r\n\r\nP: Very uhm, uh, very caring, very like sweet. Uhm *pause* definitely like uhm I remember my dad uh I was kind of like scared of him when I was like younger. Not that he did anything that was scary that I remember, but he wasn\u2019t around a lot as I was growing up uhm so\u2026 I was kind of like the guy in the house like early on\u2026\r\n\r\nI: So what about discipline, how were you disciplined as a child? Were you spanked, were you put in time out, did things taken away from you?\r\n\r\nP: Even my mom would say I didn\u2019t do a lot of things like uhh wrong and like intentionally or anything like that, but when I did I got spanked, but I never really like, she said there were never any like times you did wrong things on purpose, ya know?\r\n\r\nI: Okay what about your teenage years, what were they like?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I\u2026 was doing a lot of I guess a lot of extra stuff to make money like cutting grass, landscaping like stuff. Working on like neighborhood like lawn mowers and uhm and I got I started like helping out at like a garage when I was like 16\u2026 Like a car garage\u2026 and\u2026 spent a lot of time outside, a lot of time fishing. Said doing stuff like outside like floating down the river with my buddy.\r\n\r\nI: What about did you do any sports?\r\n\r\nP: Oh yeah like from when I was five years I was playing like basketball, soccer, uhm, I started playing golf when I was like 11. \r\n\r\nI: Did you those in high school as well?\r\n\r\nP: I played basketball like my first year of high school and then I played lacrosse like my last three years of high school and I played lacrosse in college as well.\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, Anything besides sports that you did that might\u2019ve been apart of a tight knit community?\r\n\r\nP: ...uhm...no I don\u2019t if I was ever really like, I had a tight group of friends like maybe four guys like that I was like, like we hang out like every day type deal. And we like played sports together, but I was never apart of like a specific group. Like I was never in boy scouts or I was never, uhm, in something like that where I guess you find like that camaraderie. \r\n\r\nI: What about in the last five years, so between high school and like here, what has your life been like?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, well I was in the fleet before this, so I came here the first time and uhh I ended up getting dropped in third phase uhm, towards like the end of first phase and then I went to the fleet, became a corpsman, went to Camp Pendleton for a couple of years and then I was about to get out, uhm, I had like I was like getting everything ready to go like getting school situated and living situated and my buddies who I guess are in the community kept like harassing me to try and come back before I like got out for good and I was like alright whatever, so I submitted a package to come back in. Ended up getting picked up even though like, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail, but like the big Navy rules like they only accept people in certain year groups and my year was like closed up, they weren\u2019t like accepting like anyone, I got lucky I guess that they allowed to come back and try again.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah...How do you think that uhm, kind of, getting rolled and completing first phase before and then coming back like how does that effect your time now to get through?\r\n\r\nP: So\u2026 getting dropped the first time like really sucked, uh, I was really close with the guys in my class. We still are like really close. Uhm, a handful of guys we still talk to all the time, we hangout all the time, still. Uhm, maybe its uhh\u2026 *pause* I don\u2019t know maybe you have an idea about something and then or about how things are gonna go and then it doesn\u2019t quite work out how you planned and then works out a different way I guess.\r\n\r\nI: Okay, uhm just a different track of questions I guess, but do you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nP: uhm\u2026. Like how?\r\n\r\nI: Uhm impulsive type behaviors would be like getting tattoos...getting speeding tickets.\r\n\r\nP: No I\u2026 No I\u2026 No I am very like\u2026 I do a lot of research before I buy stuff for like camping or hiking or fishing or stuff like that. I hardly ever act on a whim\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 any tattoos?\r\n\r\nP: No.\r\n\r\nI:I know it\u2019s a weird question\r\n\r\nP: No no\r\n\r\nI: There\u2019s a reason we ask the question.\r\n\r\nP: No yeah for sure.\r\n\r\nI: what motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nP: ...uhm\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I like constantly have a specific that like motivates me like the same thing ever day like its just something like you gotta do.\r\n\r\nI: What about when you think, specifically about BUD/S now, what do you think was the most challenging, or component, or event of BUD/s?\r\n\r\nP: of this time at BUD/S\u2026.most challenging\u2026 *pause* I am trying to think cause I mean I had done everything before and it\u2019s a lot easier a second time like I had no excuse to not like this time I had no excuse not to like do anything almost like perfect I guess, uhm, but *pause* I guess\u2026 I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t think of anything specific like it all kind of like bunches up\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: *laughs* blends together\u2026\r\n\r\nP: Yeah\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: You\u2019ve been so sleep deprived for the past several months.. Uhm anything like I am going to return what motivates you on a daily basis, but was there anything specific that motivated you to push through BUD/S, specifically this time.?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah, uh my like buddies I have.\r\n\r\nI: The ones that have gone through\u2026 now what about being here, was there support within the group, your class, was it peer or was it more individual..?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah uh yeah there were a couple guys that I was like friends that I\u2019m like pretty close friends with in this class\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: Are there any practices that you utilize like physical, mental, spiritual, to get through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, one thing that kind of like helps me relax I guess is like just, at the end of the day, just kind of like doing what you want. For a while I had given up caffeine just because I got somewhat like dependent on it where I was like getting like really bad headaches and I was like I kinda of like alright whatever, I gave it up cause its kinda like a bad thing, but I really love sweet tea and like soda like Dr. Pepper, so when I started doing this I was like alright I gotta do stuff that\u2019s gonna make me like happy supposed like its the little thing that makes, uh, that makes not great times better..\r\n\r\nI: Uhm, can you think about a time you had to make a difficult decision here at BUD/S, uhm, what went through your mind when you made that decision?\r\n\r\nP: \u2026 a difficult decision..uh.. \r\n\r\nI: Could be like an ethical type decision or like a moral type decision\u2026 \r\n\r\nP: Uhm, I don\u2019t know if, there\u2019s not like, you don\u2019t have like a lot time to spend thinking , you just kind of like, you just like do the kind of like the first thing that you think of like in a situation. So say they told you go to hit the surf, and you\u2019re like and ya could get away with not hitting it or not like jumping in the water, but only you have like a half second or maybe like two seconds to think about doing it or not, so you just end like doing it just cause\u2026 \r\n\r\nI: Uhm, why do you think you were successful completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nP: Uhm, cause uhh, I think everyone is like lucky to be here like very fortunate to have a chance to like do this cause like, there\u2019s tons of people that wanna come here, but uh I say I\u2019m luckier than, I\u2019m more fortunate to be here then everyo-, than a lot of people or most people here I guess. Its like a shot that I like shouldn\u2019t have.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah, so did that like second chance or whatever you wanna call it, did that really drive you this time around?\r\n\r\nP: Yeah, uhm, there wasn\u2019t like times where\u2026 I mean everyone, everyone like no matter what they tell you, everyone like thinks about quitting, not necessarily actually doing it, but you think about how nice it would be not to be doing what you\u2019re doing currently, so yeah that was kind of like\u2026 uh\u2026 that\u2019s what I was thinking about. Like man it would be nice not to be like this cold right now or.. Uh  nice to just like go home, uhm, and then I guess in like tougher times, you just like think about your buddies like what your buddies would like say to you right now or do or what would they be doing if they were here and that just makes you like uhh not care at all..\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\u2026 did you notice if there was anything different about the people that made it versus the people that didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nP: ...uhm I know a lot of who were like very\u2026 talkative\u2026 uhm as far as their\u2026 like skill or there, uh, people who thought they were going to make it, or were just very outspoken about how successful they were going to be like didn\u2019t quite make it. And people who were like maybe more realistic\u2026 uhm\u2026 like usually were the types of guys I saw sticking around.\r\n\r\nI: Great, you\u2019re finished, thank you. Congratulations\r\n\r\nP: Thank you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired.\r\n\r\nI: No, its great.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: BRADLEY\r\n\r\nDate: 10 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 97\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 00:26:45\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright and I'm with number 97.\r\n\r\nThat was my first note card and then I was given this.\r\n\r\nOk so 97 and 355\r\n\r\nYes sir\r\n\r\nTime is 0943, 10 Feb, this is Commander Ledford and I'm gonna to go through this. And you're good with us recording\u2026?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nYup\r\n\r\nSo I wanna go through some softball questions to get started with.\r\n\r\nSure\r\n\r\nUmm What buds class did you start with?\r\n\r\nUhhh 338\r\n\r\nYou started with 338. And was that your first-\r\n\r\nit was\r\n\r\nbuds experience?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nOk. How many uhh siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have two older brothers.\r\n\r\nTwo older brothers so uhh. What. your age is?\r\n\r\nI'm 26 year old. They're both like 32 and 30\r\n\r\nSo one bro is 32 or 30 and another brother is 32\r\n\r\nYes sir\r\n\r\nOk. and then parents, married, separate, divorced?\r\n\r\nYup they're together\r\n\r\nAlways been together?\r\n\r\nYes. They're both in their mid 60s\r\n\r\nAnd how is your relationship with them?\r\n\r\nUhh, its, it's solid. Uhh With my dad i'm extremely close he's one of my best friends and mentors. And with my mom I think by me coming to haha NSW it's been hard for her but we're working on it. Trying to get closer, but my dad and I are very similar so. Very strong relationship.\r\n\r\nMom is just kind of worried about you?\r\n\r\nI think yeah i think she she had worked hard uhh for our family kinda being the breadwinner wanted me to probably use more of my education toward the corporate direction. That was not what I wanted. And uhh she's come around toward what we're doing but it took a while. And uh yeah that's kinda where we stand right now. Just trying to piece together back some like.. Some just some good rapport .\r\n\r\nWhat does she do?\r\n\r\nUhh She was a CFO for a construction company and she just retired this year so she's newly retired\r\n\r\nWhat about your dad?\r\n\r\nMy dad\u2019s an insurance agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*clicks tongue* What about, looking at your life events that happened prior to coming to buds like what were the things that really shaped you?\r\n\r\nUhh so being apart of sports teams was a massive part of my identity and also just uh learning about uh human potential and So I  played uh soccer hockey and lacrosse in high school and uhh I ended up playing division 1 lacrosse at UNC chapel hill and uh we won a national championship there and uh myself and ensign mathi who is in um 338 kind of had a big part in why we kind of changed the culture there and turned things around. And so that had a big uh a big part in me wanting to do this. Was just being on a really good team and being devoted to something. And so that commemorate piece was definitely what shaped me the most. I would say being aware of other people's backgrounds from working and from playing hockey in Buffalo which is where I'm from. Had a whole lot of friends who didn't have a lot of opportunities. Uh who relied on sports teams to benefit their families and so that was extremely helpful. Just being cognisant of what's what. Um and just I think that's kind of helped me here being able to relate to guys that maybe have um been looked down upon or maybe felt like they never had a chance to get out. But um yeah those experiences were huge for me. Building confidence and learning how to communicate so uh yeah\r\n\r\nAnd that that covers the next question about how do uh these experiences factor into your experience at buds. Uh what's your personality? What do you think about your personality that contributed to your progression through here?\r\n\r\nI think uhh empathy is probably the biggest thing um understanding how to relate to other people over the same things. Make sure that guys feel valued um so i think that comes from my father. Uh my father\u2019s he's a great hockey coach, youth hockey coach. Played college hockey and williams college and all his brothers played college hockey, had a lot of cousins play hockey and um I think having um a little bit of you know awareness for guys that are going through a hard time and making sure you help lift  them is probably my most redeeming quality as an officer and definitely makes me I think stand out um and I guess my personality I like to (*unintelligible 5:45-5:48) \u2026 you know um really cognizant of details and trying to get the job done so those are probably the two things as an officer.\r\n\r\nWhat about your background um that lead you to become apart of the community, did you have any seal friends or family-\r\n\r\nSo there was\r\n\r\n-in the military?\r\n\r\nThere was a DEVGRU seal who I coached his son in lacrosse, uhh his son kinda shared some words on uhh how I\u2019d been coaching and how I had been interacting with guys on the team so his dad came up to me one time and said hey I don't know if you have a direction about where you want to go after college but I think you  might want to take a look at this. Uhh that was in 2014 and uh ever since then uh I just had the seed had been planted and I was just obsessed with it so uh I just started to look into the military specifically the seal pipeline and uh my grandfather also fought in world war 2, he was a lieutenant commander uh on a navy sub chaser and uh his leadership for our family was inspiring to me and then just kinda growing up from like having some things, I wanted to give back so that was... I thought the military is the best way to do it. I thought about firefighting for a long time but I like the military more.\r\n\r\nAbout your childhood, how were you disciplined as a child? Like were your parents very strict, did they spank you, they put you in time out, pull your toys?\r\n\r\nThere was there was definitely uh like spanking when was I was younger uhh but up until like around 5 or 6 and then after that it became more of about trust kind of uh agreement, you know like do you do things the right way, you're respectful and you're a good guy were going to give you more leeway to experience things and I think from having two older brothers kind of also brought about a pretty different place. I was able to see things early on which I think a lot of people weren't in terms of just like how the inner city works and how being close to friends whose dads are in jail or dads are... have kids with 5 different women and you're playing on sports teams with these guys and these guys don't know where they're gonna get their next meals so uh thats was uh that was huge so in terms of discipline and just it was about trust between my parents and I but uh and when I violated that they definitely like grounded me and locked me down make me focus on school or they would limit my exposure to sports when I was acting poorly so I think by the time id gotten to be like 12 i had just curbed that attitude I had... (Unintelligible 8:48-8:51)... kind of curbed that and uh I became more of a disciplined guy so.\r\n\r\nAlright uh did you guys move around a lot or?\r\n\r\nUhh no just within buffalo. My mom started to have more success in her job so we had a little bit more financial flexibility but early on it was kinda tight and so um we just stayed in buffalo just in a better house so ya\r\n\r\nAnd then team sports you talked about working on team sports?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nLacrosse?\r\n\r\nSo uh soccer hockey lacrosse and uh I had an option to play all three in college but uh I chose lacrosse\r\n\r\nSo through the last 5 years prior to coming to BUDS what did you do before coming here?\r\n\r\nSo I graduated from college in 2017 uh\r\n\r\nUNC right?\r\n\r\nYes those summers in college I worked construction uh mostly under the table uh for friends and family back home and then after college I had a series of odd jobs. I was a salesman for a metals and chemicals company in Buffalo, I was a hockey and lacrosse coach and then I also did administrative work for my mom's construction firm as well on the weekends so I was trying to save as much money as I could so I could train and then like have the luxury of like working independently and train with a performance coach to try and get me ready for SOAS. I came to SOAS and then I got a BUDS contract so\u2026\r\n\r\nHow long were you training?\r\n\r\nUmm from august of 2017 until july of 2018 that was my soas class was that july and then I got picked up for OCS I went to OCS in november of 2018. So it was about a 16 month process for me. From starting training to eventually going to OCS. And I thought really about enlisting too but uhh I wanted to go to SOAS so.\r\n\r\nSo basically graduate August 2017 from UNC, you were on sales, you were coaching hockey for about 16 months while you were training?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nAnd then you go to OCS\r\n\r\nI had an internship uh at a at a insurance company as well towards the end um I had to navigate something with my boss who I was selling metals and chemicals for. I just wanted something to do and I knew I was going to get picked up so I just wanted to get some more experience so I had an internship for three months and that was a great experience.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself an impulsive person?\r\n\r\nIm-Im-Impulsive?\r\n\r\nImpulsive yes\r\n\r\nI, I definitely think so yeah. I think um calculated more often than not but if I want to do something or if I see something as a good opportunity I take it, but uhm I, I initially transferred schools so I started out at Denison University in Ohio and I was kinda like a late bloomer for lacrosse and I had had a lot of success my freshman year uhm and that fall I knew I could play at a higher level so I decided to transfer to UNC and I kinda left, I mean I could\u2019ve had a  really really solid career at Denison and like probably won a national championship there as well but I would have been the guy and I decided that UNC was kind of was like a grinder you know. Apart of the club, I wasn't the talented guy. I was the guy who kinda had to earn everything and uhm that was probably the more impulsive decision I made. I was like \u201cI want something more\u201d but uhm I think that most people probably wouldn't have done that so I got a lot of ridicule for that but uhm impulsive I guess like things I could also think of  honestly would be I got to travel after I graduate college. I made a decision to take a 3 week trip all throughout europe and I had a series of friends that were overseas so I planned this trip using the money I saved throughout college and I went from country to country and just didn't take like, ya know I didn't like take like a long time to plan this trip I was just like \u201cI needed to go experience something new before I started my training for the teams.\u201d Yeah that was a great trip.I mean uh I guess uh impulsives i guess just like climbing or just doing hiking or jumping as a kid I never really had any fear. When I was ten years old I would go and do this 50 foot jumps with my dad and he was like \u201cHoly shit man what are you doing?\u201d but he always wanted me to experience those things for myself and challenge myself so.\r\n\r\nWhat about tattoos? Do you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\nI do I have one that's for our team, a national championship tattoo. Each guy had something a little bit different but I think about 30 guys on our team got something to honor that.\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nAnd then I have one on my hip that's very small it's just a Led Zeppelin lyric so\u2026 but not really seeking to get more. I just kinda wanted to get something at the time.\r\n\r\nAwesome. What about, what do you think is the most challenging part of BUD/S like uh think about your hardest day or event or...\r\n\r\nSo I got rolled in 2nd phase for OC5, buddy gear exchange. I had had pneumonia from hell week and uh I think I didn't want to take the roll before 2nd phase because I was in that class and it was a very special class and uh I didnt\u2026 I didnt want to not graduate with my best buds and uh so I tried to push the envelope and I was severely i think diminished and in a way I wasn't ready to go and mentally I wasn't as locked on as I had been throughout all of 1st phase I was just so kinda uh focused on the fact that I was still trying to recover from Hell Week. Uh I just performed really poorly and I uh I got Recdrop. Recognized drop from the program. First thing I had ever failed as BUD/S, had kinda been known as a top performer and uh had done really well up until that point and I felt like my world was kinda turning upside down because I got Rec dropped. I was like \u201cahhh\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause of your performance for OC5?\r\n\r\nYeah and uh it it definitely forced me to look inward and just stay focused on the fact that ya know you probably will get another shot as long as you just ya know be patient and keep working. So I just trained like crazy and dove like crazy and tried to get my lungs ready to go for OC5 by just doing a lot of breath work and um getting my endurance back up and um the second time came around and I crushed it and I was happy with that result because I think I had spent so much time focusing on \u201chey this is your option, you either improve on that weakness or not and say no I need to feel sorry for myself\u201d and uh that was a big confidence booster after the fact but that was my hardest time at BUDS for sure.\r\n\r\nYup\r\n\r\nI had about 4 weeks of being Rec. dropped with no word about when my board was gonna be.\r\n\r\nSo what got you through that, that time? Those 4 weeks?\r\n\r\nUm I had a  couple seal mentors that were extremely helpful to me. one of them being that DEVGRU seal that initially mentored me uh.\r\n\r\nYou talk to him through that period?\r\n\r\nI did. Another one who uh actually lived in Chapel Hill so I knew him from out in college, uh and Commander (Unintelligible name time 17:04). He interviewed me for SOAS um and we had developed a nice rapport during soas and he was there for me just giving me advice, that just to stay focused don't let it deter you from your dreams and you goals. And I just trained like a madman I got in unbelievable shape so I got ready to go\r\n\r\nWere there any daily practices like physical mental spiritual something that you did on a consistent basis that also helped with the challenges?\r\n\r\nUh I read a little about stoicism, about Mark Aurelius and uh I would, I had done it throughout college and as well as in 1st phase but not with the same consistency, I had a journal. I wrote a lot I wrote about my goals each day and I also wrote out my long term goals and I uh I just thought about kinda like envisioned in my head what ringing that bell at the pool would feel after pool comp. and that was like my driving factor. I would like use that image to propel you so I just thought about that image for a while. Same thing when I was going through hell week. Seeing that american flag at the top of the berm that was what got me through Hell Week like \u201cI'm gonna see that\u201d so.\r\n\r\nIs there a difficult decision maybe that you could uh that you experienced or you really really struggled with?\r\n\r\nYes uh I, I am grateful I made the choice that I did but I feel bad about the consequences it had which there was a guy in our class 338 in 1st phase. He had kinda gotten through Hell Week in my idea he snuck through. A lot of guys felt that way as well and he- this guy definitely had discipline issues like authority issues and uh he missed curfew and he also lied about having a car and had stuff in his car which is why he lied and we had this inspection during one of our PIAI akk the instructors were asking who had cars on base uh we need to check your vehicles it's a mandated thing and uh I noticed he didn't roger up and I also noticed he didn't (unintelligible 19:36-19:37) I thought he could have gotten us in trouble because I thought they were keeping tabs on us and our OIC at the time had gotten word through the grapevine through other people that yeah this guy has a car because I had visually seen him drive off base that day that we had to do the inspection. I was kind of like (unintelligible 19:56-19:58). I didn't really want to be put in that position uh I didn't think it was my place but I also didn't want the class to be reprimanded for someone who was selfish so I had to be the guy that confirmed that I saw this and then he ended up getting dropped from the class and dropped from training but he had, he also had other things that contributed to that decision and they wouldn't have dropped him if he had a clean slate or something like that. It definitely, it definitely like stayed with me for a bit because I was like damn it that's not the kinda guy I want to be known as. As like some guy that throws people under the bus but on the same token this guys totally looking out for himself, not the class and our cadre specifically said if you guys are out of line we will hammer you and so I just uh I wanted to do the right thing by rogering up when somethings asked but I felt pretty bad about that because I just squashed some guys dreams. However if that guy got into a command on deployments and stuff -\r\n\r\nExactly\r\n\r\n-is that the honorable guy you want to be in the command? So that's what kinda what kept me in check so.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful going through BUDS?\r\n\r\nI think the empathy piece, being able to relate to people, and pull up others according to their needs when they needed it. I think that's what made me stand out as an officer and also just as a person. A lot of people have made those comments throughout the past couple days since we graduated they\u2019re like \u201cthat's what we\u2019re gonna remember you.\u201d You know all the enlisted guys will go to SQT and we will go to JOTC and uh that definitely, I appreciate that um that stands out (unintelligible 21:52-21:55)\r\n\r\nWhat uh about the ones who didn't make it? What was different about them?\r\n\r\nUh I would say their overall commitment to the bigger picture not necessarily just the pain of being in BUDS but do you want to look at your buddy with honor and pride for overcoming adversity and sacrificing for the men beside you. I think that's something people probably lose sight of. You're so caught in their individual pain and suffering, not even suffering, pain and it overcomes them and uh I saw some really really good officers and enlisted guys not make it through 339\u2019s Hell Week. I was working that Hell Week, and I couldn't believe it. I was like these guys ya know if they just took a deep breath and thought about it for 30 more minutes they probably wouldn't quit. And uh yeah that was tough there was a lot of guys that (unintelligible 22:59-23:02) solid individuals who could've been really solid SEALS um had all the characteristics that you'd want. Um I think it's just making that conscious decision.\r\n\r\nHow do you feel this experience has changed you?\r\n\r\nDefinitely made me more patient um gave me some humility. I think that's the piece I can continue to work on that's just always someone better than you smarter than you faster than you so just continue to be a good listener and try to retain information um and um try to pass it forward. If someone reaches out to me who wants to go to BUD/S I gonna do everything I to help them because I never really had a lot of that list of individuals I mentioned um people kinda chilled and think you're crazy you think you make it through BUD/S? Even my parents. My mom (unintelligible 24:05-24:08)... made me feel insignificant for wanting to try and do this so.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else you think I should have asked about what got you through or helped you or hurt you.\r\n\r\nUmm maybe about funny experiences because I think humor and I think um lightheartedness is an extremely helpful um aspect of this training. You meet some of the funniest guys ever throughout BUD/S and I think that actually does play into getting through some difficult evolutions and times um specifically Hell Week. Some of the jokes that are going on or watching some guys uh do instructor impressions and stuff like I think it's extremely valuable and I know a lot of people agree. I would say the fact that being able to laugh at BUD/S is the reason why people can keep pushing forward. Umm anything else? Um maybe asking guys what they're reading. I think reading is extremely valuable especially in San Clemente Island when the guys would have downtime and we were always reading and sharing each other's books.\r\n\r\nWhat are you reading right now\r\n\r\nUh Im reading Man\u2019s Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl.\r\n\r\nWhat made you pick up that book?\r\n\r\nUh So my friend got it and I heard about it from my brother as well. It\u2019s just about how looking at the bigger picture of ya know suffering and torment and how it helps shape men uh I also reading Band of Brothers so uh between those two. It's more about the platoon experience from war... (unintelligible 26:10) \u2026 just his experience. I just uh I\u2019ll reread sections over and over again just to understand what that story is like in those places. I really like historical, historical like works and nonfiction. Try to keep those on my list.\r\n\r\nAlright thank you that was awesome that was really really good yeah I really appreciate all your uh comments it was great.\r\n\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nAlright see you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME:\r\n\r\nDate:\r\n\r\nParticipant #: \r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI: Yeah the recorder is on, is it okay if I record the interview?\r\n\r\nP: Yes\r\n\r\nI: Ok, this is participant 98. I\u2019m going to put this really close to you so I can hear you, I know my questions. So easy questions first, how many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nP: Two\r\n\r\nI: Okay and what is the birth order?\r\n\r\nP: What\u2019s the?\r\n\r\nI: What kind of birth order, where do you fall?\r\n\r\nP: Uh, I\u2019m the middle child\r\n\r\nI: And then, whats kinda the gender breakdown of your siblings?\r\n\r\nP: They\u2019re both females.\r\n\r\nI: Okay\u2026. Thinking about your life experiences, what might you describe as your crucible or kind of life shaping experiences?\r\n\r\nP: Probably the school that I went to for 13 years, basically Kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade and the experience of going there and sustaining that education was extremely beneficial for me.  Seeing the same teachers as I got older and being unable to connect back with them, um when I think about some of the most influential people in my life, its, its from (cannot discern) school. I\u2019d say that's a big one.\r\n\r\nI: I\u2019m gonna put this really close up, I\u2019m just afraid its not going to catch..\r\n\r\nP:Sure\r\n\r\nI: With the background noise \r\n\r\nP: Right, uh I\u2019ll lean in, Um.. I also believe that I went North Carolina and played lacrosse there and so...playing lacrosse at North Carolina was an extremely formative experience for me and the successes and failures there absolutely were essential, So I'd say that's another crucible. And\u2026 I did some traveling after college before I got into the military and so one of those things I did was sailing across the Atlantic, Cape Town to the Carribean. And that right there was the time of some of the best reflection I\u2019ve ever had.\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: Internal reflection, but I also spent some time, you know just a few select people and getting to know them on a really really deep level. Going through uh, interesting, uh you know in some cases hardships but more just about this physical experience was really unique.\r\n\r\nI: Was that something, I mean how did, what motivated you to do that? Were you a sailor? Whats\u2026\r\n\r\nP: I wasn\u2019t a big sailor, it was more just the interest in getting adventure. Um, and it had always been on my mind if I ever had the opportunity to do a crossing, I wanted to do one, So\u2026\r\n\r\nI: And then, did you know the people before you did that?\r\n\r\nP: I did not, no.\r\n\r\nI: How many people were there?\r\n\r\nP:There were\u2026. 6 of us on the way over to Brazil and then there was just 2 of us on the way to the Carribean.\r\n\r\nI: Um, how did those experiences, like any of them.. There was this sailing experience or you said you had some failures, sports, how did that kind of shape your experience here at Buds or help you? \r\n\r\nP: I\u2019d say it just helped me to be resilient. Um, when I think about playing lacrosse at Carolina, having small, maybe call them micro failures in a game, practice. Learning how to have a one track mind, just hit the reset button and kinda have that hammered into your brain of uh, if you uh dwell on the failure you just had, that\u2019s gonna compound and could result in having a really bad day, week, month and that's when players tend to go through really bad slumps and you know potentially quit the game altogether. So, I think learning how to um, learn from mistakes, particularly at Carolina was a big one.  Um, I\u2019d say that there's one other  place that comes to mind just because it developed a growth mindset for me, placed called Camp Pasquanni.  I went there as a camper, I worked there as a counselor for 3 years and something that we instilled everyday and practiced everyday as counselors with the boys is how can we help this boy, that boy understand what it means to have a growth mindset. How can we implement that with them um, because I think that is one of the most important things a young growing person can have is that lack of a fixed mindset and the ability to recognize that failure is a good thing and a lot of what you\u2019re doing is just growth, experiential.\r\n\r\nI: Is that where you were kind of introduced to the idea of growth mindset?\r\n\r\nP: Absolutely, yeah\r\n\r\nI: And what age were you when you were at this camp?\r\n\r\nP: I was 12 years old as a camper and then as a counselor, I was there for 3 years so that was when I was 22, 23, and 24\u2026 I believe.\r\n\r\nI: Um, how would you describe your personality and how do you think your personality contributed to progressing through Bud\u2019s?\r\n\r\nP: I um, I think I\u2019m a type A individual, like a lot of the guys here. But I think I usually fall on the more soft spoken side. Um and there are parts of my personality that are introverted in the sense that I like to read or even like paint, stuff like that. Do things that are um, very introverted, I guess introverted activities. And then there are other parts of me that are extremely extroverted and like to be in that realm so its more of a balance set of character traits. Something that I strive to be is somewhat of a Renaissance man.\r\n\r\nI: A what?\r\n\r\nP: A Renaissance, that's what I strive to be.\r\n\r\nI: So a minute ago, more specifically into your childhood, what in your background led you to becoming a Seal?\r\n\r\nP: So what led me to want to become a Navy Seal?\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: Being on sports teams and experiencing what its like to, to go through challenges with a group of people is a big one. Recognizing how beneficial that is for me personally, to share in hardship and experience success, group success with guys I think is something that is addicting and \u2026. Some of the greatest moments of my life have been shared experiences with a group towards a goal, and achieving a goal. So it made a lot of sense to me, to go to the best possible tea I could think of joining.\r\n\r\nI: At what point did you know that you wanted to become a Seal?\r\n\r\nP: Two and a half years ago.\r\n\r\nI: Okay, and that was post college?\r\n\r\nP: Post college\r\n\r\nI: So tell me, I\u2019m gonna ask more about that in just a minute, but tell me a little bit about your early childhood?\r\n\r\nP: I grew up in a, so a, two parents who are still together today and with my sisters were all close in age, so I;d say it was a very healthy childhood in that sense.\r\n\r\nI: What was your parents parenting style?\r\n\r\nP: Loving and they, a lot of it was built on trust. And so they were not the aggressive, in their, in the way they reprimanded us but they would more or less communicate that the trust was lost when we did something as kids that wasn't good and that, our relationship was strong enough that that was the worst possible, kind if like penalty that we could receive. So losing that trust and I think that that was something that was really formative for us as kids. Before we knew how to deal with people and manage people. Um, there was not a lot of shouting and uh, I think that that level of calm in dealing with the conflicts that we created as kids has rubbed off on us in a good way.\r\n\r\nI: What about discipline in your house? Were you spanked at all, put in time outs, had toys taken away or was it all just\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: I\u2019d say there was very little timeout type stuff, although there was some of that. And the physical piece was not really a thing, uh my parents were not aggressive and the penalties usually involved stuff being taken away, more restriction.\r\n\r\nI: Um, what about your teenage years, you talk about playing sports but did you move around at all during your teenage years or even earlier in your childhood?\r\n\r\nP: Stayed in the same place that I grew up in the whole time, uh so I was focused a lot on the sports. \r\n\r\nI: And you played a lacrosse\u2026?\r\n\r\nP: I played lacrosse, and a bunch of others like, liked to do a lot of different things and I\u2019d say.. I wasn\u2019t into theatre, Um, I did in the teenage years start to get into art so that was a big thing for me.\r\n\r\nI: Was there an art group or was that just on your own?\r\n\r\nP: There was a teacher in the 7th grade who kinda said, hey kind of have an eye for this, would you like to do more of this outside of school and I started to do that, you know outside of the sports practices. I\u2019d go there and do work for maybe an hour or two, painting and drawing and thats where it started and I continued on through high school and college and its still part of my life today but not to the same capacity.\r\n\r\nI: What about the last five years of your life, what have they been like? Kind of leading up to the Seals?\r\n\r\nP: So part of that includes college and a lot of that was dedicated to lacrosse, the social life at Carolina, my academics, all of that stuff was avery enjoyable time. Uh lived very carefee, did not have any fixed ambitions of joining the military, just kind of dreamed fantasies, long distanced thoughts. Then , got out of Carolina, did some traveling as I mentioned and all of that was designed to get out into the world in order to figure out what I wanted to do back in the States perhaps. I really wasnt boxing myself in, I just wanted to get out and feel the freedom of traveling. So thats, a lot of it was unknown, a lot of unknowns, and in that time there was lot of relflection, writin and reading that you know enabled me to figure out that this was the place, you know, this pipeline was the one I wanted to go through and ultinately becoming a Naval Officer is what I was gonna do.\r\n\r\nI: What about impulses? Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\nP: Yes\r\n\r\nI: So you talked about some kind of impulsive behaviors in your life\u2026\r\n\r\nP: I would say that if somebody that I trust was like hey, we\u2019re gonna go play volleyball and threw a volleyball at me, I\u2019d probably sto what I was doing an play volleyball.\r\n\r\nI: Any negative impulsive behavior? I don't know maybe a tattoo on a whim or\u2026\r\n\r\nP: No, I haven't had a tattoo on a whim and no I don\u2019t think there are any that come to mind that are like bad impulsive behavior that have had like repercussions, that I look back on and really regret. I don\u2019t have a lot of regrets in life, that I can really find.\r\n\r\nI: And any tattoos, I know its seems like.\r\n\r\nP: I have a tattoo yeah\r\n\r\nI: But its something that is profound and..\r\n\r\nP:Yeah, its a sibling tattoo. I\u2019ve had it for I think 4 years now and we probably talked about it for 5, 6 years prior to getting it, so.\r\n\r\nI:Um, any sort of driving violations like speeding tickets, anything like that?\r\n\r\nP: There\u2019s nothing on my record, no\r\n\r\nI: [Not discernable] I know it seems like an odd question\r\n\r\nP: No, thats ok, I\u2019m not judging at all\r\n\r\nI: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nP: Working with the guys that I\u2019ve been going through this pipeline with, is probably the most motivating aspect. Because when you\u2019re driving to work, yeah some days its great but ragged to the bone kind of in your own head, thinking about it. The boat you can kind of get into it, can work with the guys, you get lost in the experience of it and that is what makes you come back and I think is what is the most enjoyable piece of the puzzle. \r\n\r\nI: What if you think about the most challenging piece of Buds, whether it be a big thing or jsut a signle day, what might that be?\r\n\r\nP: The most challenging thing?\r\n\r\nI: Yeah\r\n\r\nP: Its the day in and the day out and I\u2019ve heard a lot of guys talk about that, I ould agree with it. Its the wear and tear on your body.  That you know then creates a mental fatigue and so I think that it ultimately comes down to the mental fatigue, stress that comes with this pipeline. I\u2019ve certainly felt it and I think everyone feels it one way or another.\r\n\r\nI: So what do you think motivated you to push through that mental fatigue?\r\n\r\nP: The experiences from the past, I think that I\u2019ve been through have helped me cope with that stuff but ultimately its having a very clear goal and ends, goal in sight that you can hold onto when things are going really crummy. And that manifests itself in different ways, one of the personal goals is just not to let my friends down, the people that I\u2019m working with down. I owe it to them to keep going. For my family and so thats a small thing, there are a bunch of those in my mind but thats just one of the factors that I could draw stregnth from, like ok if I quit now, I\u2019m gonna be dissapointing quite a few people. Myself yes, but a lot of people whpo have put a lot of time and effort investing in me and I owe it to myself and to them to continue on.\r\n\r\nI: Any specific practices, whether it be mental, physical, spiritual that you would utilize as you progressed through Buds?\r\n\r\nP: Uh\u2026.. I practiced a little bit of meditation, from time to time.\r\n\r\nI: Anything else you would use?\r\n\r\nP: Music, yeah music. I don\u2019t know if that counts but I found that to ber quite often, that I\u2019m going back to if I have free time. Could involve music probably.\r\n\r\nI: Is it something you like listening to with ear buds or out loud?\r\n\r\nP: Probably out loud. Um, sharing that experience with people but ear buds If I\u2019m in a public place that is not [not discernable]\r\n\r\nI: What about a difficult decision you had to make during training at Buds. What went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\nP: One of the difficult decisions I had tio make was one back, First Phase, the guy who, um I was our ROC at the time and I had to make a decision as to whether or not this person deserved to, what he had done, to be exposed and brought to light to the cadre because of the severity of the issue. Fortunately, I had other guys helping me to make the decision and I was helping them to make the decision. But I look back on that as very stressful and um, I think I\u2019ll draw on that experience in the future.\r\n\r\nI: So you don\u2019t have to tell me all the details but was that an ethical type of decision?\r\n\r\nP: Yes, it was ethical\r\n\r\nI: About something that person had done?\r\n\r\nP: Yes\r\n\r\nI: Why do you think you were successfull at Buds?\r\n\r\nP: Mindset\r\n\r\nI: Wat about your mindset helped you to be successful?\r\n\r\nP: A clear vision of where I\u2019m going and wo I\u2019m going there with\r\n\r\nI: And when you refer to who you are going their with?\r\n\r\nP: These other guys in my class\r\n\r\nI: Did you notice anything different about the guys that made it through Buds reative to the rest of the group and if so what was different?\r\n\r\nP: I can\u2019t say for everyone but recognizing a ike minded individual in each guy that has made it this far.\r\n\r\nI: Would you say you are a calm person?\r\n\r\nP: Yes\r\n\r\nI: Have you always been that way?\r\n\r\nP: No\r\n\r\nI: When did you switch from being less calm?\r\n\r\nP: I think it was perhaps going through puberty and stuff like that. I think I was a little bit more outgoing, uh outspoken probably the better way to put it.  Now I just maybe do a little less talking and a little more listening. I could definitely be a better listener. But yeah I think I\u2019m not quite as extroverted as I was in say highschool, middle school, perhaps sometime in college I started making that transition. After maybe getting counseled and talking to people and learnig and sort of observing the world and realized that perhaps it was better to do a little more listening.\r\n\r\nI: Um, thats it, well done. Congratulations!\r\n\r\nP: Thank you so much, appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI: It was good to meet you\r\n\r\nP: Likewise, thanks for your time\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 12 May 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 99\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Celeste Raver Luning\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, so again, you\u2019re OK if I record this?\r\n\r\n#99: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: This is participant #99. Now I\u2019m done with all the official things. I\u2019m gonna put this really close to this so I can catch you. \r\n\r\n#99: No worries. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: I have a couple of really easy questions first. Tell me the number of siblings you have?\r\n\r\n#99: 2 siblings.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: 2 siblings. And where do you fall in the birth order?\r\n\r\n#99: I am the youngest.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Youngest, OK. And then what is the gender of the..?\r\n\r\n#99: My oldest is my sister, and the middle is my brother.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Uhm, if you think of your life experiences, what might you describe as a crucible, or life shaping experience?\r\n\r\n#99: Just BUD/S.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Really? Nothing going into it?\r\n\r\n#99: No, nothing nearly as difficult.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What uh, anything like, I\u2019ll get into more, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. What, uh, what made you want to do BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#99: Uh, I grew up in a military family.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What branch?\r\n\r\n#99: My father was a fighter pilot in the Air Force. All the way back for like four generations, all military. So I was interested in the military. Thought about going to the Air Force, but didn\u2019t want to fly like my father. I learned about this when I was young. I was kinda drawn to the team aspect of it. I love the water, so it just kinda made sense. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So did you move around a lot as a kid?\r\n\r\n#99: Not too much, I lived in Connecticut and then Arizona. I only moved once with my dad\u2019s job, then he got to stay in Arizona for a long time. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. What about your personality do you think contributed to making it through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#99: Even keel. I didn\u2019t get really riled up when the instructors would get in our faces. I stayed pretty calm through most things.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Have you always been like that?\r\n\r\n#99: Uh, no. I definitely, like as I matured, I dealt with things a lot better as I got older. So, like, when I was young, I threw temper tantrums like every kid. But then going to college, and high school especially, I matured, and developed an ability to deal with things as they come.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: At what point in your life, like what age were you when you decided \u201cI want to be a SEAL\u201d?\r\n\r\n#99: I was just home for Thanksgiving, and my mom found stuff that I wrote in Kindergarten.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Really?\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow, that\u2019s really interesting!\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: I don\u2019t have enough time to ask you more about that *laughs*. But, uhm, so, the even keel piece, was that something that you purposely trained?\r\n\r\n#99: My father did.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Really?\r\n\r\n#99: My dad would get very upset with me. I would get in trouble if I had an outburst or if I let emotions control me. So my dad was always, uh, on me to make sure that I got a good handle on my emotions in a good way. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Interesting, OK. So, you talked a little bit about your background, and I\u2019m gonna go a little deeper. Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood? How, some very specific questions. What was your parents parenting style?\r\n\r\n#99: Definitely hands on. They were very involved with a lot of things. They made sure that we played sports, made sure we had good grades, and that we actually spent time studying. Uh, but they weren't like helicopter parents. They weren\u2019t overbearing by any means. They were always there, they were, like, uh, if we needed something we could always go to our parents. Uh, I\u2019m trying to think of a good way\u2026.my dad was gone a lot with the military, so when he was home, he was very present. I think that helped a lot. Uh, my first year ever playing football he was deployed to Iraq, and so he made sure that he parentes record every game and send it to him. Which was kinda cool. So he always tried his best, even though he wasn\u2019t always around, to be as involved as possible, and make sure that we knew that they cared, they loved us, and at the same time, if we did stupid things, they would punish us, just like every\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So that\u2019s my next question. So what was the, and it seems like a weird question, but what was their discipline approach? Like, were you spanked, were you put on time outs? \r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. yeah. I mean like every kid probably time outs, then my dad would spank me, my mom would spank me. If we said bad words they would wash our mouths out with soap. We\u2019d get grounded, like lose things, they'd take things away, like show that there's actual consequences in the world. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: The whole gamut.\r\n\r\n#99: Oh yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your teenage years? You talked about how you played football, uhm, did you play any other team sports? \r\n\r\n#99: Uh, I played baseball, uh, and as far as team goes, I was on a swim team, that's pretty much individual though.. I shot competitively and I ran track.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Any other kind of team or group activities beyond sports?\r\n\r\n#99: I was in boy scouts and then I was in the student government of my high school. So as far as teams go that\u2019s about it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about when you moved, and you said you moved from Connecticut to Arizona, how old were you?\r\n\r\n#99: I was 6 months. I was really..\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Oh so you were little? And then you stayed in Arizona?\r\n\r\n#99: Yup. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s kinda lucky.\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah, my dad went into the reserves so we just got to stay in Arizona.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Anything else about your teenage years that were kinda formative, or stand out?\r\n\r\n#99: Growing up in Arizona was great because I was forced to do a lot of outdoors stuff. So I grew up in the woods and mountains, which I think really helped here, just being really comfortable with being outside. Actually working with my hand. Like I was used to doing physical things outside. I think that was helpful.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re coming from directly, but if there were five years between highschool and coming into here, but if so, what were you doing those five years?\r\n\r\n#99: I went to the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK.\r\n\r\n#99: So four years of college there and then I took the last class available from my graduating year so it took me a full year after graduation to get out here to start.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, so in that time in particular, what was your Naval Academy experience, and what was your extra time as an Ensign, I\u2019m assuming you were a TAD Ensign, so what was that time like?\r\n\r\n#99: It was great, I liked the Academy. If I got to go back with the same outcome I would do it again in a heartbeat, but it was not my favorite place. I hated the Academy. I wanted to leave, I got talked into staying, which I\u2019m glad I did. I tried out for the water polo team, the triathlon team, the combat arms team, got cut from everything, so I had a hard time finding where I fit in until I joined the parachute team and then stuck with that that was really fun. I learned a lot there about high stress environments, and how to actually work when your life kinda depends on it. So that was great. I got involved with the leadership conference at the Naval Academy, so I learned how to delegate and do leadership type things there. Post graduation, doing TAD was helpful because that time to train before we came out here so we were physically ready, but nothing really formative as far as like, uh, my personality. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now, would you consider yourself, during that time frame, at the Academy, impulsive at all, or were any of your behaviors impulsive?\r\n\r\n#99: I wouldn\u2019t say I was very impulsive, maybe my freshman year, plebe year at the Naval Academy, I would make impulsive decisions, but nothing that I can think of after that was like impulsive which led me to anything negative.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And, uhm, do you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n#99: No tattoos.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Any speeding tickets?\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah, I have one speeding ticket.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. \r\n\r\n#99: ...That i still have to deal with. I just got it here.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So it\u2019s a recent thing?\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. Recent.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#99: Uhm, I\u2019d say my family. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, uhm, immediate family, or other family?\r\n\r\n#99: Uh, family, my wife, my siblings, my parents, my sister just had a baby right before we started hell week and I wrote her name, my new niece\u2019s name in my hat during hell week, and I, like, would look at that and remember there\u2019s more than just me. It\u2019s about something bigger than just myself. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What do you think was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Whether it was broader, or a single event, or day?\r\n\r\n#99: Uh, the daily grind, especially in third phase, it was like the same things, very monotonous, every day, for, whatever it was, 28 days, with no breaks. So you had to be 100% focused all the time otherwise you could kinda lose track and not perform as well. So just maintaining that same level of performance for an extended period of time without any time to decompress.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what motivated you to push through that daily grind?\r\n\r\n#99: I think that was just like experiences leading up from the rest of BUD/S. Like knowing that there\u2019s a purpose in the end.It kinda reminds you like oh there's a purpose why we have to be out here to learn all these different skills so we can move on to the next part. Kinda like the ending was the goal, so you knew what was coming. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: No what, was there anything, did you feel there waas group support while you were here or was it more individual?\r\n\r\n#99: Definitely group support. I came out here with four other ensigns from the Naval Academy. We lived together, we trained together for the full year before coming out here. We were all kinda each other's support group coming out here. Even though we didn't say it, we were all there for each other and knew we could count on one another and you wanted to support them as best as you could and support each other. Then the people here, obviously, once you get past hell week, after that, you really start developing bonds with people and you become a support group for each other. That\u2019s the best part about this place, is the people.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about, what practices, were there any specific practices, whether they were physical, mental, spiritual, that you performed as you progressed through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#99: Uh, for big things that were test gates, visualization was a big thing. Specifically like pool comp, OC8, in second phase, when there's all these procedures you have to go through to make sure that you finish the test, under stress, like visualization before and then during, like OK, and talking myself through the steps, I would know what to do. I think visualization was a huge help for me. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh, when you made a difficult decision during BUD/S here during the training, what went through your mind? If there was any kind of difficult decisions.\r\n\r\n#99: That's a good question. Uhm, making difficult decisions, I would try to always remember what the end state was, like the end goal, and I think basically, if the decision would help lead us to that desired end result, then that's what had to be done. There's really no easy way here, so if it was hard, it didn't really make a difference because everything was always hard here no matter what. It was almost easier to make the right decision in BUD/S, because everything was hard as it was. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So it wasn\u2019t like \u201cOh this is easy *indecipherable*\u201d\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now, what about, do you think you can give any specific examples of where you might have had some massive decision you had to make.\r\n\r\n#99: Not in BUD/S. Not really, uh, everything is pretty laid out for us, you don\u2019t have to make a lot of decisions, it\u2019s just show up, perform, and make sure you have everything you need.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Were there anything ethical or moral decisions you had to make?\r\n\r\n#99: Thankfully, I didn\u2019t really face a lot of things that...like, there\u2019s shortcuts that can be taken, that you know can be taken, and knowing the difference of when it was maybe OK to take shortcuts and when it was not OK to take shortcuts, that could be an ethical decision. If it would affect other people negatively, then no we didn't do those things, but if it\u2019s not gonna hurt anyone other than maybe myself, like sleeping in a boat when we\u2019re paddling around the world during hell week, like, yeah we did that, we slept in the boat. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Just to get the couple seconds of\u2026*indecipherable*\r\n\r\n#99: Yeah. Exactly. But major things that would affect the whole class or affect anyone else if you were found out, like no we didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t personally do that because we wanted to make sure the other guys were taken care of because that\u2019s our job.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What do you think made you successful?\r\n\r\n#99: I think I was successful because I never gave myself the option of leaving. Especially as an officer, if you leave you're done. You never get a  chance to come back. I experienced life on a ship, I never wanted to go back to that, just my opinion. My family... I didn't want to let my family down. If I quit here, I would never be able to forgive myself, now would I be able to forgive, I feel like I would have let my family down, my wife down, everyone that ever supported me. I was never here on my own, I never would have gotten here on my own in the first place. People had to throw their hat in the ring for me and I would have let those people down. And I would have taken a spot from someone else. That would have all weighed on me very heavily if I would have quit. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about, uhm, do you think there\u2019s any difference between what you saw of the people that made it and the people that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n#99: I mean you would look at kids the first day and be like \u201cOh, he looks like a stud, he\u2019s gonna make it\u201d and then they quit the first day. Nothing physically was indicative of who was gonna make it. I think once you get to know people, after hell week, you\u2019re like yeah, obviously you made it, you had a crazy life, you had all these great experiences, but at the same time, those guys obviously would make it, and those guys were just regular joes who show up and for whatever reason they just have that internal motivation or drive to make it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: ...one answer?\r\n\r\n#99: No. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well, those are all my questions. Thank you and congratulations.\r\n\r\n#99: Thank you very much ma'am, I appreciate it.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Dan McDonald \r\n\r\nDate: 17 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 347, 106\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 10:28\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and what\u2019s your participant IDs? \r\n\r\n347 and 106.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did you start BUDs and is this your first class? \r\n\r\nThis is my fourth class. I started December of 2018 with uh 335. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay a little about your background. How many siblings do you have and what\u2019s their birth order like younger sister, older brother?\r\n\r\nI have an older brother who is 30 and a younger brother who is 8. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you parents married, separated, divorced? \r\n\r\nUh, they were never married. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what is your relationship to them?\r\n\r\nUh, we have a very good relationship. With both of them and they are friendly with each other. Most of the time hahah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any life changing events that happened to you prior to BUDs and whatever you think life changing is that\u2019s what I\u2019m asking about? If you didn\u2019t have anything that\u2019s fine too. \r\n\r\nUm, when I was younger I almost died in a white water rafting trip. Ever since then, I felt like I needed to do something more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow old were you?\r\n\r\nI was 10. I think. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. But you still obviously like the water.\r\n\r\nYeah, it was a very cold, traumatic experience. Made me appreciate cold water hahah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did this experience factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm, it just showed there\u2019s worse things that can happen to you. Like thinking about my little brother going through stuff like that as well. I don\u2019t know I feel like I need to be like a protector I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your getting through BUD/S? Anything specific that\u2019d you say oh yeah this is \r\n\r\nYeah, I\u2019m just kind of like, uh, a little bit more careless I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did that help you?\r\n\r\nYes, certainly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nI was sort of able to push things away like what I thought about negative stuff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay that helps.\r\n\r\n(unintelligible) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your background that even led you to become a SEAL.  Like do you know anyone in the military? Do you know anyone that was a SEAL?\r\n\r\nYeah, my grandpa was in Vietnam. Uh, and my brother is Army Special Forces. He had a lot of influence on me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you didn\u2019t want to do the exact same thing he did?\r\n\r\nNo, he didn\u2019t like it. He just got out. He was never good in the water. I was a swimmer and I was pretty good in the water. So, I wanted to do that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo tell me about how your parents disciplined you as a child?  Did they spank you? Give you a timeout? Do they make you run? What was the most?\r\n\r\nI got spanked really early, but it was mostly like at this point in the game you know it would get to me. I never wanted to disappoint them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot as a kid?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your teenage years?   Did you have team sports there that you did or with a tight knit community?\r\n\r\nYeah, I was on the swim team and the golf team. I didn\u2019t really fit in with those groups because I wasn\u2019t really as smart as them I guess. Those were kind of the smarter sports like versus like football or wrestling. But uh I really enjoyed being around those people so.\r\n\r\nAnd that was in high school? College?\r\n\r\nHigh school. I didn\u2019t go to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou haven\u2019t yet\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat did you do in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S?  Like did you go straight from high school?\r\n\r\nNope, I was working a lot. My dad owns a contracting company. He builds houses and stores and stuff. I got a lot of experience from that. I knew if I joined at 18 I wasn\u2019t mature enough ya know. I don\u2019t think I would have made it then. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s mature. Would you consider yourself impulsive like do you have tattoos or do you make impulsive decisions? Do you think? \r\n\r\n Uh sometimes. I have my moments, yeah. I have a couple tattoos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you give me an example? \r\n\r\nI guess its mostly like buying stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Think about your hardest day, what motivated you to get through and do you think the team helped you get through? \r\n\r\nMy worst moment was Hell Week. Monday night and I just thought about my family and I didn\u2019t want to let them down or let myself down. That was really all I thought about. Being a good role model to my little brother. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any physical, mental, spiritual practices that helped you get through?\r\n\r\nNo, I mean I had ideas but once you really hit that point that you want to quit those don\u2019t really matter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat helped you get over an idea? I mean I would think everyone in this program wants to quit at sometime but then the question is what do you do to get through that\r\n\r\nJust talk to yourself. That's pretty much it. Just positive mental attitude. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any difficult decisions that you had to make during BUDS? Like, you, a classmate cheating or whatever and what went through your mind? If you had something. \r\n\r\nWe had a guy that was lying to the instructors about uh I guess he had drugs in his truck. Is what it turned out to be. We had a car search and he didn\u2019t like tell them that he had a vehicle. He was in my boat crew and he was a really good guy we thought and we had to turn him in and he got dropped. That was pretty tough to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat went through your mind when you were trying to decide if you were going to turn him in or not?\r\n\r\nI thought about like how hard he put out and um like what he did for me during hell week. Then I thought about working with him in the future and decisions like that and uh \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd jeopardizing others\r\n\r\nYup. It was pretty selfish of him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you had to think one thing that made you successful what do you think it was?\r\n\r\nLike in the pipeline or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, just here at BUDs. \r\n\r\nUm, uh, I dont know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a different way. What separates you from the people that quit. What did the people that quit, what did they not have?  \r\n\r\nI guess confidence maybe. Or overthinking. It's not that hard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. I don't know. I beg to differ. How do you think this experience changed you as a person? Are you the same guy who when you graduate? You are the same guy but what has changed since December 2018? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m more disciplined definitely. But I have uh a more careless attitude I guess. Its weird like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr maybe. Youre saying careless. Do you mean that you don't take it seriously? \r\n\r\nYes, I don't take things as seriously, but I am definitely more disciplined. It sounds contradictory but I don't know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I should have asked you that will help the Navy better pick people who will be successful in BUDS? \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think so. No. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. Awesome.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Quinn Greenheck\r\n\r\nDate: 07 FEB 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 109\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): LCDR Dietrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in

with the rest of my\r\n\r\nA:ok um until ten, ok if you think of your life experiences, childhood, teenage years, what might you describe as your crucible or life changing experiences \r\n\r\n109: lets see so I moved uh when I was ten we moved to Reno southern california and then uh I\u2019d say the biggest one was when I was fifteen it was about 2008 I believe both my parents lost their jobs and we had to move in with uh relatives back down in southern california \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n109: so that was probably the craziest thing that happened\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n109: ya I was pretty I was pretty fortunate until about then i was about 13 years old or 14 15, I was pretty privileged until I was fifteen years old\r\n\r\nA:ya, how did those experiences factor into your experiences at buds?\r\n\r\n109: well I learned a lot from my parents my parents kinda found work multiple jobs kinda found different ways for us to kinda be able to do the things that our friends were doing like playing baseball going on trips and stuff like that so they kinda sacrificed a lot so we could a have the things that we wanted\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n109: and then uh it was for my siblings it was a little harder them to see but for me i kinda saw what they were doing behind the scenes, stuff like that um, so ya I\u2019d definitely say a little I got most of kinda that everything that you do is bigger than you I got that from my parents\r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n109: and they never made an excuse they never complained they kinda just uhh they kinda just worked and worked multiple jobs and didn\u2019t sleep and didn\u2019t eat just for us and that was really inspiring and that kinda continued kinda still like today kinda the same way bt  \r\n\r\nA:ya, how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through buds\r\n\r\n109: I guess I\u2019m more kind of a quiet and I kinda just want to I\u2019m also competitive and definitely through buds it's kinda it\u2019s kinda the thing where uh you are always you don\u2019t you wanna do better than the guy next to you like especially with a lot of like the guys here like some of the guys i\u2019ve gone straight through with it\u2019s kinda like that you know I\u2019m not gonna let you make if I\u2019m not gonna make it we started kinda attitude and you kinda started developing that in boot camp, the same guys I hung out with in boot camp are the same guys I hang out with now and it\u2019s funny how that worked out   \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n109:cause theres a bunch of little clicks when you first get there and you kinda see um  you know those same people and clicks and I don\u2019t know how that\r\n\r\nA: so going back to being this on your personality  \r\n\r\n109: oh ya \r\n\r\nA: is it a loyalty to

impulsive\r\n\r\n109: yes\r\n\r\nA: can you give me any other examples of being impulsive\r\n\r\n109: uhhhhh lets see so uh I had been offered scholarships to go play basketball and uh I guess the day that I signed to go to the school that I went to I kinda just sick of waiting around and I just wanted to sign so I just signed, I wanted to stay in california it wasn\u2019t necessarily as good of a school it wasn\u2019t a division one school that I wanted but I just made the decision to sign and not wait to try and get something better so that was kinda an impulsive decision.\r\n\r\nA: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n109: um well something that definitely you now uh grad getting to a SEAL team and deploying is the ultimate goal you know BUD;s at first now it\u2019s not only getting to a SEAL team but being able to contribute something in a positive way once you get to a SEAL team\r\n\r\nA: so being able to contribute \r\n\r\n109: ya it\u2019s more than just getting there being an asset \r\n\r\nA: what was the most challenging component of BUD/s, this is a holistic question so think about your hardest day or event um what was the most challenging\r\n\r\n109: I guess the most the most challenging thing is probably when uh I guess it was kinda lose focus and looking at the big picture instead of focusing on individual tasks that you were doing, like during hell week if it was Sunday night of hell week you were like Jesus I have five more days of this I don\u2019t know if I can do that, that\u2019s when you have to recognize that negative small talk and sort of look at the small picture for me i guess during hell week i can kinda remember um focusing on uh you know one step at a time rather than looking at the big picture and even when you finish hell week and think about everything else you have to do it\u2019s still kinda overwhelming it's kinda just one step at a time getting through OC8, getting through your pistol qual, getting through your rifle qual   \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n109:so \r\n\r\nA: its all that compartmentalization\r\n\r\n109: ya\r\n\r\nA:was there anything that motivated you to push through hell week in particular \r\n\r\n109: ya my buddy, I didn\u2019t want him to get through and I didn\u2019t get through I didn\u2019t want to have to tell my family that I quit\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n109:um that was probably the main thing was embarrassing my family most of all and having to put my helmet on the grinder \r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n109: and having my name out there \r\n\r\nA: so when you your buddy is it competition with the buddy\r\n\r\n109:ya it\u2019s competition\r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n109: that\u2019s kinda more of a the that's part of it definitely \r\n\r\nA: do you feel supported by the group is there encouragement\r\n\r\n109: ya definitely definitely\r\n\r\nA: ok uhhh is there any other practices whether its physical mental or spiritual that you use to get you through challenging times, prayer, meditation, stretching \r\n\r\n109:yes I do pray\r\n\r\nA: you do pray \r\n\r\n109: um stretching not so much\r\n\r\nA:some athletes will do a pregame ritual \r\n\r\n109: so like ya I guess this was more of a second diving thing but visualization\r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n109:definitely is huge probably the most important thing\r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n109:ya um visualization\r\n\r\nA: when you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/s what went through your mind as you made that decision \r\n\r\n109: um let\u2019s see uh how is it going to affect people around me so is that is this more like a tactical decision \r\n\r\nA:uh did you can you recall can you give me an example of a tough decision throughout the entirety of BUD/s and kinda talk me through it \r\n\r\n109: ya so BUD/s you are mostly told what to do \r\n\r\nA: right \r\n\r\n109: and you kinda do what you are told it\u2019s kinda once you get out to the island you start making decisions like on your own like I mean decisions putting obviously but decisions the decisions to cut corners right or something like that take the easy way out instead of the decision to do something where you could cut a corner it\u2019s more of like is this gonna make somebody else's day harder I guess i mean that;s probably what most people will say here that they hold they hold their classmates in very high regard and they don\u2019t want to do something to uh kinda have these guys look down on you I mean they say you are constantly being evaluated even if the instructors aren\u2019t there\r\n\r\nA:right ya \r\n\r\n109: we\u2019re evaluating each other on something\r\n\r\nA: alright ummm why do you think in completing BUD/s and why do you think others were not\r\n\r\n109: maturity I think I I i uh lived on my own since I was 18 moved out went to college graduated got my own place paying bills stuff like that obviously there's some young guys here but they don\u2019t know what it's like to get out on their own they don\u2019t really know what the consequences of what happens if you don\u2019t if you don\u2019t I mean I knew I knew that making it through the program and having to go out to the fleet I knew that how bad that could be and    \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n109: and uh I don\u2019t think people realize what the consequences or what can happen if you don\u2019t work hard or you know apply yourself and finish what you start \r\n\r\nA: Did you notice anything about people that didn;t make it what did they have in common\r\n\r\n109:ummm selfish I think I think they cared more about themselves then the people around them\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n109: umm when things got bad things got scary they felt sorry for themselves they didn\u2019t really care how anyone else was feeling or ya \r\n\r\nA:ya \r\n\r\n109: I think they didn\u2019t know how to see the big picture\r\n\r\nA:ok (long pause) how did you change as a person\r\n\r\n109: umm confidence wise I am more confident now definitely um kinda learn that even though you are not good at everything you can develop that skill develop um ways to get over obstacles and stuff like that umm it you know is weird thinking about when you first came how like unsure you were of like like you know when going to boot camp like should I be here you have those thoughts obviously that go through your head but then every time you uh get over that next test or next obstacle you\u2019re like I\u2019ve done this before I can do it again easier said than done people say that to you before but until you actually experience it \r\n\r\nA:was there anything that I didn\u2019t cover uh that you would like to share \r\n\r\n109: no you pretty much hit everything\r\n\r\nA:ok ok great thank you so much\r\n\r\n109: awesome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n",

Guide\r\n\r\nA: This is interview subject one one zero one ten and then do I have your permission to record  \r\n\r\n110: yes you have my permission to record\r\n\r\nA: ok, how many siblings do you have \r\n\r\n110: uh two \r\n\r\nA: and what is the birth order\r\n\r\n110: um I\u2019m my brothers the oldest, hes 30, I\u2019m 29, I\u2019m the middle and my little sisters 25 \r\n\r\nA: ok if you think of your life experiences what might you describe as your crucible or life shaping experiences\r\n\r\n110: um besides BUDS\r\n\r\nA: yes\r\n\r\n110: um ya I think BUDS BUDS is by far the biggest one\r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n110: I have to imagine that will uh be everyone's answer on that question\r\n\r\nA: before s\r\n\r\n110: before that \r\n\r\nA: childhood teenage\r\n\r\n110: oh that\u2019s a good question\r\n\r\nA: college\r\n\r\n110: ya i mean college I\u2019m thinking if anything stood out as particularly difficult um overall kinda patterns carried out I wouldn\u2019t say there was any sort of \r\n\r\nA: hardship \r\n\r\n110: hardship growing up that I had to do um I did get my pilot\u2019s license um that was pretty difficult   \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: so that was probably one of them but there was no growing up family hardship \r\n\r\nA: ok how did getting your pilot's license or going through college factor into your experiences going through BUDS\r\n\r\n110: uh probably the same lessons you get um when you go to college or getting your license it\u2019s applicable to BUDS um you learn attention to detail um you know you learn to both those both college and pilots license are just not something you achieve overnight so it is probably you get out of surveys you are working for a goal for a long period of time and you can't really give up halfway through that goal similar to BUDS so you kinda make the decision to do something and you follow through it um so you know you probably learned a little bit of that um I learned a little bit of that um just gently from written type stuff from having to achieve those long term goals not just an overnight an overnight success   \r\n\r\nA: right and how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through buds\r\n\r\n110: I don't think my personality changed I think I was the same guy personality wise now\r\n\r\nA: ya so to clarify, not how your personality changed but how your personality contributed to your success at BUDS\r\n\r\n110: sure sure well I think a big is just my Im pretty light hearted like I I was laughing for 95% of BUDS even when it sucked and that's kinda the same way I've been in life but like keeping a sense of humor with everything your going through everyones in the same situation\r\n\r\nA: ya\r\n\r\n110: We\u2019re all miserable together so theres something funny about that umm I think ve always be just not I it wouldn't sit right with me if I quit um everything I've done I did in life I\u2019ve just whether it\u2019s my own I don\u2019t want to use the word ego cause that's a negative connotation but for myself you know I wanted to make sure I got through this and did it umm did never give up\r\n\r\nA: okay not to put words into your mouth but would you say pride?\r\n\r\n110: I would say pride \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: ya I more pride less less ego I would\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: cause ego is a bad connotation around here but umm but ya my own self pride and self sense of accomplishment \r\n\r\nA: okay describe your background that led you to become part of the seal community\r\n\r\n110: hmm mum \r\n\r\nA: um so you could tell me about your childhood \r\n\r\n110: mm ya sure so I I kinda bounced around growing up I lived in a bunch of places umm I born in arizona then moved to new jersey then salt lake city Utah umm\r\n\r\nA: were you from a military family\r\n\r\n110: I was not but my dads job moved around quite a bit\r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: so we moved around quite a bit and then umm one of our the one place that was consistent was coronado, we have a summer house here, still do \r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: So I\u2019ve been coming to Coronado since I was you know one years old two years old whatever it was so even though like this has always felt like home to me\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n110: I learned about the teams early when I was young umm it was something I always wanted to do but I never really pulled the trigger on it you know obviously I enlisted in the navy at 29, 28 \r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n110: so it took me awhile to get here \r\n\r\nA: yep \r\n\r\n110: umm but\r\n\r\nA: but that seed was planted young\r\n\r\n110: ya id say so and then I went to college got out of college and started working some desk jobs uhh and just felt overall unsatisfied with what I was doing and Id find everyday I'd be on youtube finding videos on seal teams learning everything I could about the teams so one day I said screw it why am I wasting all this time watching videos why dont why don't I uhh actually follow through with my dreams so kinda quit everything and ran off to join the circus\r\n\r\nA: great so if you could tell me going back to childhood uhh about your parents your families parenting style\r\n\r\n110: ya \r\n\r\nA: so specifically we are interested in discipline so spanking versus timeout versus withholding toys or video games\r\n\r\n110: ya that's a good question my parents were strict they weren't like beat me strict it wasn't like I was getting the belt or anything like that but\r\n\r\nA: ok was there any corporal punishment spanking or \r\n\r\n110: uhh no \r\n\r\nA: restraint or \r\n\r\n110: no maybe like no maybe like once in my life they were they were gentle gentler gentler punishers I guess but they were definitely more on the strict side\r\n\r\nA: so curfews\r\n\r\n110: curfews no obviously no drinking like that growing up \r\n\r\nA: okay \r\n\r\n110: they were very good parents you know I\u2019d had to have good grades in school get into a good college do all that\r\n\r\nA: ok and then in teenage years uhh you talked about your moving around did you participate in a team activity or a sport\r\n\r\n110: ya \r\n\r\nA: that would have a tight knit community\r\n\r\n110: ya I I think any sports team that is a team sport has a tight knit community\r\n\r\nA: so did you play any\r\n\r\n110: I played basketball uhh in high school \r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: I played volleyball as well which in California is kinda law I went to school in arizona \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: and I ended up playing college volleyball at USC in Los Angeles \r\n\r\nA: so High school and college\r\n\r\n110: yep for volleyball\r\n\r\nA: was that D1\r\n\r\n110: ya that was D1 we were number one in the nation for two years\r\n\r\nA: that's great,  congrats \r\n\r\n110: I never played I was a walkon \r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: so that probably helped a lot too actually looking at it now just cause I had to be the one first one in the gym last one to leave just to prove that I belonged on that team \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: cause there was much better talent that they had on the team so the one thing I could really offer was hard work and a good attitude about it \r\n\r\nA: ya ok great, what motivates you on a daily basis\r\n\r\n110: uhhh I I would say just trying to better than the person I was yesterday I think I think umm I think lifes in constant quest to get better and if I pay every single day I need to make sure I do something that makes me better than the human I was yesterday\r\n\r\nA: ok great what was the most challenging part of BUD/s \r\n\r\n110: um\r\n\r\nA: it's a holistic question think about your hardest day\r\n\r\n110: hardest day \r\n\r\nA: or the moment where you might have had that \r\n\r\n110: yaa \r\n\r\nA: unintelligible \r\n\r\n110: Monday of hell week\r\n\r\nA: monday \r\n\r\n110: about 24 hours into hell week I was having a pretty rough go I was tired cold and hungry I hadn\u2019t quite got into that lizard brain state yet and one of my best buddies who Id spent the last four months with I knew his family his girlfriend he quit uhh  that kinda rocked me a little bit uhh but then I remember we did a very specific evolution called uhh base tour it's this savage like long run with boats on head and it was one of the hardest things of BUDS. That actually kinda kick started me into feeling I was down in the dumps and we did that evolution and I was like hell yea like this is exactly I deserve to be here I belong here and for the rest of hell week I knew I was gonna get through it, it was just that one one crazy evolution that got me through that\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: that pain and that suffering pushed me into that primal state  \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: and I was pumped about it \r\n\r\nA: ya cool uhh okay so is that;s actually my next question is what motivated you to push through so you hit primal\r\n\r\n110: ya \r\n\r\nA: and then did you feel like you were supported by the group \r\n\r\n110: I felt like it was a journey that we were all in together but at the same time it\u2019s your own path, the hell week battle it's it\u2019s a big internal battle with yourself as well. You obviously have to rely on the support of the guys around you but there has to be something inside of you that gets through it, you control your fate. I could've chosen anytime to quit or I could've chosen anytime to push through it. You gotta chose it \r\n\r\nA: what practices physical mental or spiritual did you utilize to get through the challenge, do you pray meditate do you\r\n\r\n110: honestly I don\u2019t do much of that stuff \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n110: we learned a bunch of mental toughness techniques uhh for hell week but I think umm ya I mean there was a visualization and I used a lot of that for more technical skill type stuff for example we had this stuff in phase two called OC8. it's a very technical test. I did a lot of visualization at home to get the procedures down right. But as far as Mental toughness you just kinda its hard to put a finger on it I just didn\u2019t quit\r\n\r\nA: would you call this chair flying \u2026. Unit. \r\n\r\n110: yea its like chair flying you know the whole going to your happy place and stuff like that didn\u2019t work for me Id go to my happy place and get hit by a wave \r\n\r\nA: haha sure \r\n\r\n110: and get knocked out of it, it didn\u2019t do much\r\n\r\nA: when you made a difficult decision during training during at BUDs, what went through your mind as you made that decision and can you provide an example, so were you ever in a tough place where you had to make someone to do something for you and you had the autonomy to \r\n\r\n110: ya the thing about BUD/s is you don\u2019t have a lot of autonomy, every decision you make is pretty much made for you especially throughout you know first phase definitely, second phase third phase a little more autonomy. I would say like a difficult decision if you can go back to hell week that monday night it was the decision of do I stay doing this being in pain hurt and tired then you know for the first and only time in training that I had a second weighed options you know I was like shit if I quit what do I tell my family and those thoughts had never crossed my mind in this pipeline and it was only ten minutes and I was I was challenged and you know you make the decision then and there I\u2019m not gonna let this decision get in my way you know I'm gonna power through it, that was really the only decision you make at BUD/s. Ya I mean there is simple like you know do I go to safety on a pier but just basic day to day decision but not like big life changing decisions that was probably one of them\r\n\r\nA: ya great I mean obviously this decision could have been assisted by infinite moments but you didn\u2019t realize or didn\u2019t recognize it was a decision until then\r\n\r\n110: ya I mean you always know its in the back of your head but it was a full frontal head on collision that I needed to make this decision right now kinda thing\r\n\r\nA: okay so this is gonna sound like another general question but why did you think that you were successful in completing buds and did you notice anything different about those that didn\u2019t make it right so like why you \r\n\r\n110: ya we talked about this alot with the guys around here and our families so I think its gonna sound like a terrible answer but I think a massive part of it is self delusion like tricking yourself into thinking you can do anything\r\n\r\nA: those are people who fail\r\n\r\n110: why people no no no why people succeed \r\n\r\nA: ohh \r\n\r\n110: right so my theory is like you have to be so good at everything through this pipeline that you gotta be able to run boats for miles on end then you gotta be smart enough to do diving stuff and then safe enough to do gun stuff and no human should really be able to be that good at every single facet of training right your gonna kinda road block at some point during training but if you can trick yourself into training like screw it I can diving I can do gun stuff I can do first phase and hell week and you just telling yourself that absolutely like no doubt in my mind I'm getting through this even if somewhere else statistics are against you and it's gonna such and you\u2019re gonna get through it but if you can trick yourself into saying ya I can do this you can do it, it\u2019s that old quote of those who think they can and those who think they can\u2019t are in both right it\u2019s true, believing in yourself and making sure yourself of making that decision. Does that make sense I know its kinda a weird answer  \r\n\r\nA: no it does so we\u2019re talking about confidence about uhh \r\n\r\n110: ya its confidence in yourself but again the whole like its self confidence but a smart person should realize that that there's no way you can get through all this stuff and learn what you need to learn just if you can trick yourself into thinking you can it tends to work out i don\u2019t know that was my problem but probably not the most uhh political answer but you know\r\n\r\nA: no \r\n\r\n110: tricking myself into thinking this from the beginning into getting through it is probably how I did it  \r\n\r\nA: no its not the best but you did it personally and we\u2019re looking for those raw real answers. So was there what would people do that failed out\r\n\r\n110: ya I think bad attitudes I think they when there was pain and suffering and making jokes they were relying on other guys to pick them up I think they just let that consume them and got bad attitudes about I think um overall physical fitness has a big part in it you know I think there's dudes that just ya I its physical fitness does play a role in it but at the end of the day you still have to carry a boat a long way. So you\u2019re gonna have to some level of strength in order to do that\r\n\r\nA: so it starts at a low level \r\n\r\n110: ya they really weren\u2019t as physically strong as some guys\r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: it's tough training you gotta be able to be physically strong\r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n110: and the other one is attitude is not uhh physical mental and then I just it was uhh \u2026.unintelligible\u2026..ya I can\u2019t express what exactly what it is I think attitude is a big thing like you choose if you make it through the program or not like a lot of people who don\u2019t make it through or have excuses they their hurt or injured or the day it was cold that day so that's why I didn\u2019t run as fast they throw out bullshit in my opinion like you are the one that decides if you get through or not and you guys even hit on it in your surveys there's like 11 12 questions if I see a roadblock in my way who has control of that and the answer for most the guys here is I have control the example I use is it starts on that 20 percent that make it through training or whatever it is and people are like oh that's terrible how are you gonna make it through its 20 percent the odds aren't 20% it's not like I got a five sided coin and I get lucky you literally control whether you make it through this or not so in my mind you have a 100 percent chance of getting through cause you are the one who decides they don't decide for you. IF you perform and you do what they say and you just get through it you're gonna make it through and its as simple as that\r\n\r\nA: so umm \r\n\r\n110: bonus question, extra credit what is this \r\n\r\nA: um how did this experience change you as a person, are you changed is what I should so how\r\n\r\n110: ya I'm more proud of the guy I am now than when I started I would say I wouldn\u2019t say it made me tougher I wouldn\u2019t say anything like that I feel like it brought out qualities I had and gave me a chance to test those qualities sense of humor stayed the same you know and I\u2019m just happy, im generally a happy guy I don\u2019t get pissed off a lot I\u2019m just here to have a good time and make some friends uhh do some really cool job \r\n\r\nA: does this opportunity to test yourself improve your confidence, do you think your confidence has gone up?\r\n\r\n110: uhh it\u2019s good to confirm obvious like you know, it\u2019s good to confirm it would save time I just I don\u2019t know ya it helped with confidence I guess but I kinda I felt like I was trying to get through the training before I came in here \r\n\r\nA: okay\r\n\r\n110: I didn\u2019t come in saying oh I may or may not make I came in knowing I was going to get through whether that was self delusion or what it works\r\n\r\nA: anything else you'd like to add?\r\n\r\n110: no that's it \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Robert Finch\r\n\r\nDate: 12 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 112\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 29:06\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dietrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 112\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO):  When did you start your BUD/S class?

Grew up pretty much spending my entire life with my family.  I think before I joined the navy the longest we\u2019d been apart was maybe a week.  I joined out of high school so.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  And do you have a good relationship with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes!  I talk to them almost every day, maybe a couple times a week.  They live close, an hour, so I see them all the time too.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Anything else about your family dynamics that you think would be relevant to what we\u2019re talking about in terms of\u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm I grew up in a pretty stable house hold.  My parents make good money.  Self-employed.  Um.  Pretty much was able to, not do whatever I wanted, but if I really wanted to go do something my parents were usually able to make things happen so I\u2019m pretty fortunate in that way.  Never really struggled for anything.  Um.  So I think that\u2019s interesting because there\u2019s also people that have had polar opposite experiences in this community so\u2026 yeah.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So what life changing events have happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh okay!  So, the biggest thing that ever happened in my life is\u2026 I originally enlisted in the Navy, and then I got picked up for an officer commissioning program through Seaman to Admiral.  Um and in my last year of STA-21 I actually got arrested for running from the police and I lost my commissioning, I lost my rate, and I was sent to the fleet which sparked my ability to come here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhhh do you want to talk more about that incident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh yeah.  I joined the Navy.  I enlisted as a Nuke.  I went through Nuke school.  And I got picked up Seaman to Admiral as a nuke, umm\u2026 I was in ROTC at University of Arizona.  Uhh I did very well.  Umm.  I was slotted to be a nuclear officer.  And then I got into riding motorcycles.  Rode with some of my good buddies and stuff there.  And uh we just kinda spent day to day riding kinda oblivious to the law.  We kinda did whatever, we\u2019d speed wherever, and one day we were out riding and we made an illegal pass.  Umm we uhh, this police officer happened to see us.  He turned his lights on behind us and we just decided we weren\u2019t gonna pull over.  We were just gonna leave because we thought we\u2019d get away.  Umm long story short I end up getting away, but my buddy didn\u2019t.  They took his gopro and then I got arrested two weeks later.  And went to all the court hearings and all that kind of stuff.  And ended up getting dropped from STA-21.  Uhh, kicked out of the program, they took my commissioning, uhhh tried to send me back as a nuke and then uh I had some paperwork get messed up by PSD and I lost my security clearance.  So they sent me to the fleet as a DC man.  And then as soon as I got to the fleet I figured there was nothing else in the Navy I was gonna do besides come here so here I am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So how did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm I think the biggest thing I learned was\u2026  So I spent a long time why I made the decisions I made like why I did that.  Because literally I\u2019d never been in trouble my entire life.  And then like, I had so much to lose but when it came down to it I didn\u2019t think about the things I had to lose, I didn\u2019t think about the rest of my life, in that moment I just automatically made a decision.  I was like I had to figure out why I did that.  And what I figured out was that the decisions you make on a daily basis, like little tiny decisions kind of train you to make decisions in the moment.  So like the teams always talk about how you fall back on training, and I found that 100% in real life though.  So I realized that in that split second I was like, \u201cHey do I pull over or hey do I run?\u201d  Because I had already spent weeks making poor decisions against the law so I had already made that decision before it came up.  Um and I found that same principle applies here.  Because most people that quit, a lot of the times its not, the people don\u2019t think about the rest of their lives they don\u2019t think about like \u201cHey, how is me quitting right now going to affect me down the road?\u201d  A lot of times its an in the moment decision.  As much as they\u2019ve been thinking about it or whatever but I think that most of the time when people quit its an in the moment decision.  I think that comes down to like\u2026 how have you trained yourself in the years before?  How have you trained yourself your whole life?  Do you make those small decisions?  Do you give up on little things throughout?  Have you ever spent time completely dedicated to something and training yourself to have that dedication?  And I think those people that have, when they get here, when it comes down to those moments where you\u2019re like I don\u2019t want to do this anymore, you\u2019ve already trained yourself that it doesn\u2019t matter what you want.  You\u2019re going to stay dedicated to whatever you\u2019re doing.  I think that\u2019s like, what I\u2019ve noticed from\u2026 It\u2019s highlighted in that experience from my life and I then I saw it when I got here.  And I think that, is one of the biggest defining factors in my opinion of what allows people to move on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So what have you done consciously to then train yourself with those small decisions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so I think for me the biggest thing that got me through here was that I spent about 3 or 4 years doing bodybuilding and stuff.  And through that practice, you have to be 100 percent dedicated, so like every single day when you\u2019re like hey I want to eat this you have to like make that conscious effort not to.  And then it becomes kind of like second nature.  If you\u2019ve ever been on a diet you kind of notice that its hard at the beginning but then you like fall into the track and its easy to make those good decisions.  So I think having that ability to discipline myself is one of the biggest things for that.  Uhh and then when I was training to come here I did the same thing with my training.  I would be like oh its raining outside and its cold, I don\u2019t want to go outside and train.    But like no, these are those little decisions that make the difference later on.  So during my training I\u2019d be like if I didn\u2019t want to I would push myself and be like, \u201cHey I need to make this little decision if I want to be successful later.\u201d  So I make that decision and then ya know, it translates here.  Like to be honest I never even considered quitting.  It was just kinda like\u2026 When things got really bad my mind didn\u2019t even wander in that direction and I think that\u2019s because I knew that\u2026 I think I was able to make those decisions before they even became a thought process.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYeah um\u2026 honestly I don\u2019t know how much of an affect its had.  I\u2019m not a\u2026 honestly, I\u2019m not the most liked person in the class.  I\u2019m a little selfish at times.  Which I\u2019m working on because its been highlighted here.  Umm honestly, we have so many different personalities I don\u2019t know if I could say one type of personality could be any different, like could offer you anything else than another kind of personality.  So, I don\u2019t know if I really have a response to that.  Like I know people in this class who are disliked by the entire class, and people tried to tell them to quit because they didn\u2019t like them as a person and they\u2019re still here.  It may make it a little easier if you\u2019re more liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So yeah, that\u2019s like an external view of personality.  What other people consider to be traits of you that would predict behavior.  Uhh and then there\u2019s kind of the self-assessment.  Which you probably saw on some of the questions you completed on the tablet.  Uhh the personality factors in several different models.  Maybe you\u2019ve done Meyers-Briggs Test like MBTI.  Or there\u2019s some that have another, a sort of 5th dimension, uhh, one that we refer to is openness, how open you are to new ideas or experiences.  Conscientiousness, how organized you are.  Extraversion.  Introversion.  Are you a shy person?  Do you seek out parties and people?  Do you get your energy from others or having some alone time?  Agreeableness.  That\u2019s sort of how friendly you are.  And then neuroticism.  Which has a bad connotation when you say someone is neurotic but it\u2019s a spectrum, being sort of catatonic like a chill kinda surf bum to being a sort of nail biter and just really nervous about things.  So uhh are any of those traits, have any of them held you back maybe?  I heard maybe in your weight lifting maybe a degree of conscientiousness?  Sort of disciplined and organized?  Pursuit of a goal?  Do you feel like that might be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitely.  That\u2019s literally in my opinion what is going to allow you to make it through or not.  Whether or not you\u2019re able to make the tough decisions now and see down the road.  Umm but a lot of the other ones.  For me personally.  I don\u2019t think so.  Other than maybe agreeableness.  I\u2019m the sort of person that I like being the best at everything.  And I didn\u2019t like not being the most agreeable person in the class.  You know like, a lot of guys didn\u2019t like me, I was very polarizing.  So a lot of guys liked me and a lot didn\u2019t.  So maybe if I was more agreeable it would have helped me a little more but overall I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think personally it helped me at all and I don\u2019t see a consistent one of any of the traits across the board.  You know like I don\u2019t see one of those traits being something everybody has.  Like we have the full spectrum on pretty much all of those things in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming a part of the SEAL community.  Like do you have any SEAL family, friends, mentors, coaches, or friends from school? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the only thing that even guided me towards the teams was when I was in school I wrote a paper about Admiral McRaven\u2019s commencement speech.  So when I wrote a paper on that I found out about the teams and then I read his book and I found out more about the people that are in the teams.  And I thought hey maybe some day if I ever had the opportunity that would be cool. But being a nuke I had no way out of the community, like I had to be a nuke.  So I never even considered coming here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So how did you watch the speech originally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on YouTube.  So actually I think it popped up on Facebook, ya know.  And I watched it in high school and then I had to write a paper in college and I thought of that and I wrote it for that.  But umm I think one of the biggest reasons I\u2019m here is that I like to be the best at anything and I felt like being a SEAL would put me there for most things in life.  So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So I\u2019m going to put competitiveness under the personality question.  So tell me a little bit about your childhood.  Like how you were disciplined?  You talked about your family which sounds like a great cohesive group there.  How would you describe your parents parenting style?  Were you spanked, were you sent to timeout, was it free range parenting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was young we were disciplined when we needed to be, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been grounded in my life.  Umm my parents weren\u2019t overly demanding.  My dad would be like you can\u2019t have any C\u2019s.  So like my parents, my dad was just like you can\u2019t have any C\u2019s but I don\u2019t really care other than that.  Umm I think the biggest think was that they demonstrated by example.  So like I\u2019d want to be like my father so he would like show me what I would want to be like.  But I was never really heavily disciplined I don\u2019t think.  They weren\u2019t very strict.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Okay, did they take away your video games or what were the consequences if you brought a C home?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I think it was more like disappointment, and I didn\u2019t like disappointing them.  I don\u2019t think I\u2026 like I said I don\u2019t remember ever being heavily punished.  If me and my brother ever got in a fight or whatever we\u2019d get the belt but nothing like\u2026 when I was younger.  My mom would get the old wooden spoon out.  Yeah never\u2026 I don\u2019t think they were overly disciplining parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move around during your childhood or teenage years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not.  I mean I\u2019m from southern California and we\u2019d move around to different houses just because my mom gets bored but we never moved far, we were pretty much in the southern California area the entire time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did moving houses require you to change schools or social groups at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I went to a private school from Kindergarten, actually pre-school all the way up until 8th grade.  So I went to the same school with the same group of people.  Um and then I went to a public high school, the same high school for 4 years.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, tell me about your teenage years.  Did you participate in a team sport or activity with a tight knit community like theater or\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm no I played football for about a year and a half.  I wasn\u2019t really super into it uhh\u2026 I wasn\u2019t really super into the sports or anything like that.  I was very into, so we did like a lot of off-roading.  We\u2019d ride motorcycles or drive cars.  I was a mechanic so I worked on stuff all through high school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, was that a club?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, just friends at home.  My dad is a mechanicish, does mechanical things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Where did you get this competitiveness?  Did you compete on motocross or\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know actually.  I\u2019ve never thought about that, where it came from.  Literally my entire life I\u2019ve always strived to be, like I\u2019m never okay being like another person in the crowd.  I\u2019ve always strived to be different than everybody else.  I\u2019m usually different in the way of trying to be above everybody.  Um, I even do that here, um.  I don\u2019t know where that came from to be honest with you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So what have you done in the last 5 years of your life?  I think you\u2019ve covered it before.  You had ROTC\u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I joined the navy out of high school in 2014.  Umm and then I went through nuke school 2014 into the end of 2015.  And then I went Seaman to Admiral, so I did that until I left there at the beginning of 2018.  Went back to nuke school for about 6 months trying to get back in.  And then I got sent to San Diego to a ship at the end of 2018.  As soon as I got to the ship I applied to come here.  I got lucky.  The ship was in the ship yards, my CO was an old nuke so he had sympathy for me, and he helped me get here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  You must have done something though, to breakout, and have a successful package?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo well I mean I graduated like top of my class from nuke school, and then I was a very good\u2026 and had nearly a 4.0 in college so those\u2026 both of those helped me, especially with my CO.  But as soon as I got to my ship like I knew I wanted to come here, I knew I couldn\u2019t just you know, go to the ship and blow that off and try to come here.  I knew that would irk a lot of people.  So basically, when I got to the ship, again I was just trying to be the best person around.  I learned everything as fast as I could, got qualified as fast as I could.  Within 3 months I had made a mark and everyone kinda knew who I was already, and I said that I wanted to come do this.  So, they kinda knew what I wanted to do and the package submission time came and I threw it all together and luckily like I had some people in the chain of command that were willing to help me out that sympathized with where I had been and where I wanted to go.  I was able to submit and then I got selected, I had pretty good physical scores and then my prior success in the navy, even though I had one pretty big downfall.  The last thing, oh my year group.  The year I joined the Navy they really needed SEALs from that year.  So, those are the big 3 things that helped me get here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So sounds like some work and also some luck.  Would you consider yourself impulsive?  For example, do you have any tattoos that you got on a whim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019d be the polar opposite of impulsive.  I tend to think through everything.  I\u2019m the type of guy that if I want to go buy something on Amazon I look at 50 reviews before I even choose to buy it.  I\u2019m usually not influenced by commercials or you know marketing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So do you think that incident, getting arrested, I mean for me that\u2019s a red flag of like an impulsive decision too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s where I think\u2026 That\u2019s what I had to figure out when I looked back on it.  Do I have a character problem, is there something wrong with me that I impulsively made the wrong decision?  But that\u2019s how I figured out that I think it\u2019s because of the decisions beforehand that kind of guided me into making that decision.  Umm\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So you\u2019re more of an analytical thinker?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100 percent, yes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Okay, great.  We\u2019re getting there.  What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? So this is like a holistic question.  Uh it could be like your hardest day, it could be\u2026 it sounds like maybe you had some personality complex.   (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMhmm, well I didn\u2019t actually have any personality complex until we were all stuck on an island for 5 weeks.  People like saw me as a person at all times of the day.  Normally like when I was at work I\u2019d be at work, and then when I went home I\u2019d do my own thing.  The big thing for me was that I went to bed early a couple of times when I was on the island, and people didn\u2019t like that.  I\u2019m also the type of person that I don\u2019t operate unless I have a good amount of sleep.  Which is, uhh, different than some people.  The hardest thing I think for me was uhh just the water.  Umm I was never really a water person I was borderline like afraid of water.  Every time we had a big water evolution I\u2019d be very nervous about it.  It\u2019s what I got rolled out of 38 for.  So I think water, any time we did a water evolution it was difficult for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated to push through that, when you had that fear or lack of confidence?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, I just think the dedication.  The being able to see the bigger picture.  There was no way I was leaving here even if it was for water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Did you feel supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think, I don\u2019t know.  I think everyone kind of gets in their own head.  Especially because 2nd phase is all water and everyone is kind of on their own.  People aren\u2019t\u2026 like people kind of cheer each other on and are like, \u201cHey, good luck.  You got this.\u201d  But I never really got much out of that.  I think it\u2019s more of I put in the hours and I knew I was able to do it, ya now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  You felt like a \u201cGo get it, you got it, good job\u201d was\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust people being nice to each other. I was confident in my own abilities to do things.  That\u2019s the only comfort I had in my opinion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Are there any practices like physical, mental, or spiritual that you used to push through the challenges?  So here we\u2019re asking do you pray, do you have a mantra, do you do visualization exercises?  Often times athletes will have a warmup routine ya know\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you talking about in the moment or just???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Yeah so maybe before a water thing or before a tough evolution was there something that you did or a habit you had or a prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably not.  I would really try not to think about it and just think about something else.  Maybe visualization a little bit.  I never really had anything set in stone though.  Probably some times when things are really stressful it\u2019s just like animal brain and you just shut down and just let the things happen that are supposed to happen.  Like during pool comp I just trusted that I was able to do what I was supposed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So, you\u2019re good at kind of numbing yourself.  Or would you say\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think, yeah probably.  I feel like I\u2019m pretty good at not overthinking things when I\u2019m stressed out.  Just go step by step I guess.  I don\u2019t really have a great answer for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Do you have a name for that, kind of like \u201cBeing in the moment\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean we call it front sight focus.  It\u2019s like look at the closest goal and then focus on the next one.  Uh and that can be expanded or contracted based on the time frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Where did you get that term?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm, I think its just a term that\u2019s been thrown around this community.  Uh I don\u2019t exactly know where it came from.  I know Master Chief Magerati has a lot of stuff but I don\u2019t know if any of that helped me particularly, maybe it helped other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So you learned that here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.  Yeah I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Uh, for example: running classmates out or turning in a cheating class mate. Uh, how did you process that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to think of an example of where I made a difficult decision.  Because I never did anything\u2026 I mean specifically I don\u2019t remember specifically doing anything like that.  If I had to I would probably try to think of what\u2019s going to be best.  So, when I think of things like that\u2026 I guess peer evals, I had to make hard decisions on those.  And uh, my thing comes down to \u201cHey would I trust this person to\u2026 would I trust this person with my life down range.\u201d  Really that\u2019s what it comes down to.  Um there may be people I don\u2019t like, but if I can trust them to save my life then they\u2019re fine.  You know maybe there were people I liked that I gave negative reviews because I don\u2019t know if I could trust them to save my life.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think that you have been successful in BUD/S as compared to somebody else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, probably like discipline.  I have developed that ability to make the hard decisions, (pause as yelling in background to lock it up) uh to make those hard decisions before without having to think through it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Is there anything different you noticed about those that dropped?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm probably yeah they just didn\u2019t have that ability\u2026 The environment was stronger than their mind was able to think.  Um they were overcome by their current situation rather than the long term.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So you think their mind was weak and their body was?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a physical thing or an inherent thing.  I think its something that can be trained.  And maybe they just didn\u2019t have that.  And there was a couple of guys that I was surprised.  One of them who was a wrestler who quit.  Usually wrestlers are very good at that self-discipline because wrestling requires a lot of self-discipline.  But you know maybe he didn\u2019t use his time as a wrestler.  I don\u2019t know his story.  But I think statistically wrestlers tend to do pretty well.  Especially ones that can run.  Umm.  And I think it\u2019s because they have that developed self discipline.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience, again holistically, change you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing I\u2019ve noticed differently is that I\u2019m less okay sitting around relaxing.  I used to be okay just chilling sitting back with my family wasting time.  Now I constantly am wanting to be going.  And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just because I\u2019m used to an environment where I\u2019m constantly going but that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve noticed pretty clearly.  Like I\u2019m not good at sitting around and relaxing anymore.  I am always wanting to be doing something.  So that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve noticed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Is there anything else I should have asked you that helped or hurt you about BUD/S?  Anything else, any questions we didn\u2019t cover?  Especially when we\u2019re covering this topic of grit, hardiness, resilience, mindfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think what I\u2019ve talked about with self-discipline is the biggest thing that I\u2019ve learned from it.  The only other thing that I\u2019ve noticed that I thought was peculiar was that a lot\u2026 so like normally walking around American society most people have a sports team or they\u2019re really involved in sports.  I would say 70% of the people in this class don\u2019t really care about sports or don\u2019t really care about sports anymore.  They don\u2019t really have a team and like I was always that person but people always thought I was weird for not watching sports.  Like here, its completely normal to not be super involved in sports.  That\u2019s another thing I noticed that was kind of peculiar.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Yeah that is, thank you for bringing that up.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Quinn Greenheck\r\n\r\nDate: 23 APR 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 113\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): LCDR Dietrich \r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nA: Okay what is your participant ID number, this number right here\r\n\r\n113: 113\r\n\r\nA: ok and do I have your permission to record\r\n\r\n113: yes\r\n\r\nA: ok awesome.

Can you think of an example of one and what was going through your mind when you had to make a decision \r\n\r\n113: umm so ya there there\u2019s a tough one um one of my friends when i was in my original class he was in my boat and we were in hell week and he was super beat up basically more beat up then the rest like physically beat up and we weren\u2019t as fast as we could have been and we were kinda holding back for him and I basically told the boat crew we\u2019re not gonna run him out just cause a lot of that was on me and I didn\u2019t want to see this guy that I worked with for six years get sent home for something that you know at the end of the day doesn\u2019t really matter ya you can I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s physically capable of being an excellent operator but he just had a bad luck bad draw card  \r\n\r\nA: so your decision was to hold back the rest of the crew\r\n\r\n113: right so I basically made the executive decision that we were not gonna run this guy out of the crew \r\n\r\nA: held back to save um one member \r\n\r\n113:ya \r\n\r\nA: and what was going through your mind and then the big picture\r\n\r\n113: the big picture was i\u2019ll take the beatings just as long as he doesn\u2019t leave\r\n\r\nA: loyalty to this individual\r\n\r\n113: ya exactly and I know for a fact that he would have done the same for and the whole boat crew was on board and the whole boat crew thought he was a good guy and it was the end of hell week it was like Thursday morning or thursday afternoon so we knew he wasn\u2019t gonna quit so \r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n113: just gotta pull the reins back a little bit\r\n\r\nA: why do you think you were successful and then why do you think others weren\u2019t you know what i mean?\r\n\r\n113:ya ya \r\n\r\nA: like why did you make it through and what was there something like a trend or in those that failed out \r\n\r\n113: um I think a lot of it is luck um in hard work luck, hard work and just the will to like no matter what and just know that this is your last chance at anything here and you set your entire life you know devoted your entire life to make it through and their gonna have to kill you to get you off ya\r\n\r\nA: so for those that failed out DORd or dropped um \r\n\r\n113:they might of had straight up bad luck they could have worked harder, lost that fight, lost that fire like for example bad luck would be broken leg injury or something something that isn\u2019t your kinda out of your hands you know what I mean \r\n\r\nA: How has this experience changed you as a person\r\n\r\n113: yes I think so, how, I think I\u2019ve become more introverted than extroverted from when i started \r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n113: maybe the last six to eight months I don\u2019t know why maybe the whole quiet professional thing I\u2019m starting to figure that out \r\n\r\nA: umm so your like internalizing that \r\n\r\n113: yes yes trying to apply that \r\n\r\nA: anything else? \r\n\r\n113: No I think that\u2019s it you \r\n\r\nA: is there anything that I din\u2019t talk about that you'd like to share about this experience that you think would be helpful for grit resilience \r\n\r\n113: um the biggest thing I can think of is it sounds kinda cliche but it\u2019s always gonna end at the end of the day your gonna go home and your gonna take a shower and your gonna eat cause they have to feed you that's if you can just think of that, if i Had thought about that the first time I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t have quit I kinda go tin my head I would have just thought about that more, I\u2019d probably be in a different spot ya \r\n\r\nA: great ya I\u2019m gonna stop it\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 20 April 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 118\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Deirdre Dixon\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, so what\u2019s your number, and is it OK if I record?\r\n\r\n#118: Yes. 118.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, 118? OK. So thank you for agreeing to do this. I appreciate that, im gonna just hold these. Uh, first of all, can you tell me, like, how many siblings you have? And, what\u2019s the birth order? And, if they\u2019re brothers, sisters?\r\n\r\n#118: I have one younger brother.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Alright. And then, what, if you think about your life experiences, what might you describe as your crucible and life shaping experience you had? \r\n\r\n#118: I guess one is probably that I came through BUD/S a while ago with class 304 and quit, so that threw a wrench in the life plan for quite a while.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. \r\n\r\n#118: That\u2019s probably the biggest one. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And so, how did that impact your experience that you had with this one?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, it helped because I knew a little bit of what to expect in first phase, but beyond that it didn\u2019t really help much. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n#118: And I knew how much I knew I didn\u2019t want to go back to the fleet, so that helped motivate me. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, do you think your personality contributed to you getting through BUD/S? \r\n\r\n#118: Uh, I think so, I was, I mean, I had six years to grow up and mature within the navy which helped a lot. So, I think that helped, perspective wise.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what made you want to come back?\r\n\r\n#118: Immediately after I quit, I really wanted to come back for a while and then I lost interest, but towards the end of my, my re-enlistment was coming up, and it was something that I never really didn\u2019t want to do. I always really wanted to do it, and then I just got motivated again and decided it was now or never.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So you re-enlisted to do this?\r\n\r\n#118: I\u2019m on like an extension right now, but after SQT I will have to re-enlist. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Great. And then describe your background that led you to even wanting to be a SEAL. Like, for example, so tell me about your childhood, and how would you describe your parents\u2019 parenting style. For example, if they had to discipline you, what did they do? \r\n\r\n#118: Uhm, they would, uh, relatively little, like time outs, uhm then I got older and they made me write sentences so many times...\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK.\r\n\r\n#118: If I did something wrong. That\u2019s pretty much it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, how about your teenage years. Did you move around? Were you in sports?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, I swam from when I was little all the way through college. I lived in the same house, my parents still live in the same house. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Sometimes swimming can be very individual, sometimes it can be team oriented. What would you say your swimming experience was?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, once it got to college it was very team oriented, but prior to that it was far more individual.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. OK. So what have you done in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S? And then, so you sound like you were in the Navy. And would you consider yourself impulsive, like some people have lots of tattoos, or do you binge drink? Do you have an impulsive tendency, do you say?\r\n\r\n#118: Probably, yes. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Why do you say that? What makes you say that?\r\n\r\n#118: The tattoos, well, all of those were planned out. Uh, but, if I decide I want to go buy something or go do something, I\u2019ll usually just go buy it or do it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, what about, did you get an enlistment bonus? To sign up for BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#118: When I first came in, there was a bonus if I had made it through, and then the job I got after I quit, there was a bonus for that, and there will be a bonus when I re-enlist eventually, but I didn\u2019t get anything to come back. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So did the bonus come into play as far as when you decided you were going to re-enlist? \r\n\r\n#118: No.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No? OK. What do you think motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, I mean in BUD/S it was like the guys in the class. I wanted to like *undecipherable*.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And what particular way? Not wanting to let people down? Or like?\r\n\r\n#118: Yeah, like not wanting to let people down. Not wanting to fail in front of them. Sometimes within my control *undecipherable*.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What would you say is the most challenging component of BUD/S? So think about your hardest day. What helped you make...what was challenging for you?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, I don\u2019t think there was any one day, it was just the total grind of all of it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh, huh.\r\n\r\n#118: It kinda starts to wear on you, especially going to San Clemente. But, it was never anything like the first time through. Where, like the day I quit, I was like \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d I never felt that this time. There were definitely hard days, but nothing crazy.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, what motivated you on those hard days? What made you motivated to push through? Like what were you thinking about?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, how much it sucked to tell people I quit the first time and not wanting to do that again. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\n#118: Like the class?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yes.\r\n\r\n#118: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, what practices did you use to help you get through? Did you do meditation? Anything mental, spiritual, or physical to get through all your challenges?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, I like, on long runs or rucks where it hurts like bad, I would just count in my head, or like day dream during the swims, or stuff like that. But other than that, not really.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Any decision that you could have made. \r\n\r\n#118: Uh\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Can you think of anything? \r\n\r\n#118: Not really. There were times where I thought I was feeling pretty shitty and we had to do things that most guys don\u2019t wanna do, and it was, just, we have to do it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh huh.\r\n\r\n#118: Other than that, not really.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So why overall, do you think you were successful this time?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, better physically prepared for it, and mentally I think. For sure had a better *undecipherable*.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So before you had come straight from bootcamp?\r\n\r\n#118: Yes. I finished college, and then I came in right about seven months after graduation. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you know anything different about those that didn\u2019t make it? Like can you describe what made you make it and not somebody else? \r\n\r\n#118: Some of them were surprising, like some guys that you thought were gonna make it. And other ones that were just, especially in first phase weren't physically strong enough. Just some of the younger kids. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, how would you say this experience changed you as a person? \r\n\r\n#118: Uh, gives you like a perspective on how bad things can be. And, how easy almost everything we do is.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Anything else I should have asked you that you think would be important to know for people coming in?\r\n\r\n#118: Uh, not really, no. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK.\r\n\r\n#118: Make sure you\u2019re good at running in the sand, I guess. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what\u2019s interesting is you\u2019re only my second guy, and both of you had come back. I thought that there was no way you could even come back. \r\n\r\n#118: There\u2019s a lot more in this class than normal. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Really? That\u2019s awesome. OK. Thanks so much, I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jesse Hall\r\n\r\nDate: 23 AUG 20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 119\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview:  19:41\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay so I have a series of eight questions with some sub parts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseveral of them uh we got about 15 minutes to try and get through all of them. So ya know if you can uh try and be through, but also somewhat concise. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, but if we don\u2019t get through everything that\u2019s fine too. \r\n\r\nSo when did you start uh BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went to BUD/S a long time ago in 2008 with class 272, didn\u2019t make it through that time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you rolled or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I was dropped for disciplinary reasons and then I came back in March of 2019 with class 338 and I got performance rolled during that class and that\u2019s what brought me to 339.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOkay uhh 2008. How many siblings do you have? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two, an older brother and a younger sister. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you have a brother, you and sister. And uh what about your parental situation? Your parental situation growing up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re still together, still alive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMom and dad? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm what\u2019s your relationship with them like? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh its pretty good, I guess its like hasn\u2019t been great since I\u2019ve been in the military for awhile and I\u2019m not as close as I used to be with them and we have different political views so 2016 didn\u2019t help, but we are in good standing uh solid relationship right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh there were several. Not making it through BUD/S was pretty life changing in 2008. It was the first time I had ever been held responsible for my actions. Umm 2009, I got divorced which was emotionally stressful and that 2009 was a rough year, [laughs] I got robbed that year too. Um other challenges in my life, I went to college in 2013, first of my family to go to college so that was that was a whole adventure, ended up going really well. And also, I used to be a competitive endurance athlete and I\u2019ve ran some really hard ultramarathons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does that stuff all factor in to your experience at BUD/S in terms of maybe how you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely, so just dealing with the emotional stressful things, I knew BUD/S wouldn\u2019t be as emotionally stressful as getting divorced or getting robbed or, or something like that. But then as far as physical challenges and intellectual challenges I knew that they would be similar to ultra running and college so, so I picked those things to prepare for this training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind of worked out nicely, I\u2019m a workaholic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is participant ID 119\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt, it worked out nicely, cause I\u2019m a workaholic and this, BUD/S, is a, not a 9 to 5 job it's like a 16 hour day type of thing. Um. Can you repeat the question one more time please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust how do you think your personality contributed to your experience here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I, I don\u2019t like the, the, I\u2019m not one that like thinks about myself first, I\u2019m always trying to figure out, what is, what can help who the best, and it turns out that\u2019s incredibly applicable to this training. Cause it keeps you distracted from your own hardships, and it helps the class succeed more, so it, so my personality fit pretty well for this training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, describe your background that lead you to pursue becoming a SEAL. Like, do you have any SEALs as family members or friends, or any military friends family, or how did you, what motivated you to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had an uncle who retired from the Army, he\u2019s a lieutenant colonel. Then my brother, he\u2019s a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps. And so service was always like a, it wasn\u2019t unusual in the family, but ultimately I hate to say it but, at the time like, the SEALs were in the news a lot and there were movies and video games and it was, everybody knew what they were, and everybody knew that they were considered the best. So that\u2019s what originally drew me to it and, and now it's more like I, I see the effectiveness that the community has, and now it's more like a, a draw to service, and how I can do the most with my time here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me a little bit about your uh, we got a few questions about your childhood, growing up, events, um. How were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, get spanked. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanked? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I assume everything else, to, like grounding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, they really didn\u2019t ground me a lot but they would take electronics away, that, that was another thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move a lot in your teen years, childhood, teen years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZero. Zero to eighteen I was in the same house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you were in ah, junior high, high school, did you participate in, in any uh team sports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did ah-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr in any kind of team activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, so ah, football, wrestling, and track and field. I guess track and fields, running, I guess(unintelligible) but football, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, anything else, um?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam oriented, I, I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything academic, um, oriented, team-oriented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, in in high school I was in the orchestra, played the cello. I think that\u2019s it really. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. What have you done for the last, in the last five years of your life prior to BUD/S now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I, I finished up college two-thousand and sixteen. And, after that I worked for an engineering firm in New York City. I was a marine engineer diver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you worked for a marine engineering firm in New York City?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I was a marine engineer diver, so I picked that job specifically for, for this but, um.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what did, was that a civ-that was, in the Marines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was just a civilian job\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just a civilian job. So the marine engineering part we did waterfront engineering so docks, piers, seawalls, wharfs like the whole harbour area of new york we'd we would, I had a commercial diving certificate, uh license, uh yeah certification excuse me and so we would go dive the structures and swim back down uh then write a report on them and put repairs recommendations stuff like that  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was like in the Hudson or the East River?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, both, yup... and he's giving them the plan of the day, but um yeah it was... (unintelligible 10:38-10:41)... on that we were a four or five man dive team for those things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you  were in the navy before\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you went to BUD/S in 2008? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what happened after BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was an aircrewman. So I, BUD/S didn't work out I went to aircrew school in Pensacola Florida. Uh after that I got stationed in Oklahoma uh I flew on  E-6B Mercurys for three years, got out in 2012, went to college from... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah 2016 went to work for an engineering firm from 2016 to 2018 and then uh rejoined the Navy after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere in Oklahoma?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh right near Oklahoma state base called Tinker AFB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up in Tulsa so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh really? Really? I miss there. I love that town. I loved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI couldn't wait to leave \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up there uh from um fourth grade to highschool. Um would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently a measure of impulsivity I didn't know that. What was the most challenging component of BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh first phase, the physical grind of it all. I, I thought I trained well with all the ultra running but this was more of like a whole body wear down and maintaining joints and things like that was the the hardest part for me. Especially cuz I\u2019m older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHuh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEspecially because I\u2019m older.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh a couple things. Knowing that I kinda spent my whole life trying to get here was a big motivator like I didn't want to waste time. I didn't want to waste all that time. My my wife um she is totally bought into the idea and I didnt want to let her down and um the comradery, the comradery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of practices did you use physical, mental, spiritual whatever uh to get through challenges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor buds specifically one thing that really helped me was telling myself I had no other options. It was either progress and get through or eh there were no other options. I literally told myself either they\u2019re gonna haul out on an ambulance or I'm gonna get through. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you made difficult decisions during BUD/S um what went events or what went through your mind uh making the decision and what kind of decisions did you struggle with uh the examples that they have here are running classmate out or turning in someone for cheating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, I\u2019ve had a couple of, so I think of it as a couple of different contexts, the first one was like if we all made it through and we\u2019re working together can I trust this person? That was the major way that I made decisions or that another one was did this person uh compromise the class with their actions? Specific examples what we had a guy who stayed out too late drinking didn\u2019t make it back for curfew like I ended up turning him in and he got in trouble with the class because he was a liability to the class and like screwing us over and a few had gotten caught. So those were some examples of those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you think about not just how it hurts them but how keeping them in hurts everybody else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah like the long term picture, and even like on deployments like can I trust this person ethically because there\u2019s a magnifying glass on the community right now, so all those things factor in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S, I mean you\u2019ve already sort of given me some of that, but is there anything like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh preparation, then another big thing is um I don\u2019t know this might sound weird but like having people like you is is I mean it\u2019s important because they\u2019re less likely to wanna run you out of [unintelligible] So being cooperative and a team player were big [unintelligible] for that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different about the people that didn\u2019t make it than the people who are still here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019d I\u2019d say for the most part its like the seriousness from which they approach training, yeah there there are a few guys who are still jokesters who don\u2019t like take this too seriously but for the most part guys are much more focused than those who didn\u2019t make it through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas this experience and if so has it changed how has it changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh much more aware of strengths and weaknesses. This training is amazing at determining those things. Um and confidence like if you can make it through this you can make it through pretty much anything, anything\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I should of asked you, that um helped you or hurt you in getting through this process or did we cover everything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I guess I guess I found that that age did play like a big factor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt did?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, yes, it takes a lot of time for the older guys, like a lot of maintenance time versus a lot of the younger guys who are whose bodies are more resilient and I I think that\u2019s why there\u2019s so few guys that are 30 that make it through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean the cap is what 30, the cap might be like 30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt uh it is, you have to get an age waiver after 30, so there there are 3 of us who had to get that to be here so it\u2019s definitely a young man\u2019s game\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell believe me it just gets worse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah and the very last thing which kinda going back to I think the seriousness in how some people approach training is like reflective of their level of maturity, like I was I was pretty surprised by how mature most of my classmates are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that\u2019s it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, congratulations on making it through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate that\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: MCVICKERS\r\n\r\nDate: 12 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 120\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 15:04\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it OK if I record?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nAnd what is your participant ID?\r\n\r\n120. \r\n\r\nEasy questions first. When did you start BUD/S, is 339 your first?\r\n\r\nNo I originally started with class 335 uh got rolled in first phase in the pool, classed back up with 338 in BO and got all the way to third phase with 338 before going to 339. \r\n\r\nOk so you got all the way to third phase with 338 then to 339?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nSo that\u2019s some perseverance.\r\n\r\nA little bit. \r\n\r\nWhat happened in third phase during 338?\r\n\r\nI was uh doing land navigation and slipped off down the slide of a slope and chipped my tooth. \r\n\r\nOh gosh, so another medical rollback?\r\n\r\nYes another medical rollback. \r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have uh two sisters uh one is just turned 18 a senior in high school and the other is 10 years old. \r\n\r\nAnd you\u2019re the oldest then?\r\n\r\nI am. \r\n\r\nTell me about your parent situation, do you have a two parent household?\r\n\r\nI have two parents, my mom and my step dad uh my step dad has been around since I was two he\u2019s my dad\r\n\r\nDo you have any contact with your birth dad?\r\n\r\nUm no I haven\u2019t talked to him.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s their situation like at home? Loving household?\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re very supportive, they\u2019re loving, pushing us to strive for our best. \r\n\r\nDid you live in one place all of your life or move around a lot?\r\n\r\nUm just two houses.\r\n\r\nWhere did you grow up?\r\n\r\nUm Tucson Arizona.\r\n\r\nIts very different land out there!\r\n\r\nVery barren. \r\n\r\nAny life changing events that happened prior to coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh senior year football, I got a hernia the first game of the season and had to get surgery the next day and couldn\u2019t play football the rest of the senior year season. Very traumatic for me I thought I had worked all high school and senior year was kinda over right there. \r\n\r\nDo you think because you had two medical rollbacks that helped you get through?\r\n\r\nUh ya so I kinda correlated it a lot its just another one thing that happened its like might as well push on with it. \r\n\r\nDid you go to college or are you coming straight from high school?\r\n\r\nStraight from high school I looked into colleges but uh wasn\u2019t really focused on the school aspect of it and said you know might as well go for it. \r\n\r\nSo you went to boot camp then came here?\r\n\r\nYeah so I went to bootcamp in July of 2018 I was 17 at the time and had my mom sign a form. \r\n\r\nWhen did 335 start?\r\n\r\nWe got here December 3rd of 2018. \r\n\r\nAnd been in San Diego ever since?\r\n\r\nYep its been a little while now. \r\n\r\nHow did any of your experiences from childhood factor into your experiences here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI would mainly say that my mom was very strict so it correlates very easily with instructors being up your butt all the time just like my mom, she also never let me have an excuse and was like you know what you want to do so get it done. I came out here and they treat me just like my mother did.  \r\n\r\nWhat would be an example of her strictness?\r\n\r\nUm there was just no room for error, she knew from a young age that I wanted to come out here and do this so she always held me accountable and just never let me slack off. Sit on the couch too long and she would make you go find something to do. \r\n\r\nWhat about your personality and how that contributed to getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh I will definitely say a lot of these guys who are older and out of college are a lot more mature than me and they have taught me a lot. Um and I talk a lot jump around a lot but they would help me move down to uh more their level \u2026 I\u2019m just like young, smart, a lot of energy. \r\n\r\nAre you lighthearted or more serious?\r\n\r\nI would say I\u2019m more lighthearted I take some things seriously you know. \r\n\r\nDo you think that helped?\r\n\r\nI think that does help because there has to be someone in the class who keeps the morale up and then there has to be someone who gets them where they need to go. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve heard that lightheartedness helps a lot, so not a bad thing. What about your background led you to want to join the SEAL community? \r\n\r\nUm I was about eight years old at a family barbeque and uh I knew I wanted to be in the military from a young age and my uncle was like the Navy SEALs are the best of the best so if you want to be the uh best warrior be a Navy SEAL and I said OK and ever since that day. \r\n\r\nNow was anybody a SEAL in your family?\r\n\r\nNope uh nobody was uh except for my grandfather he was a Marine in World War II. \r\n\r\nNo other military?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nBut you from an early age wanted to be in the military? What made you want to be in the military?\r\n\r\nUh I was just I always liked structure like uh I had like an internal clock like at this time I wanted to get ready so I always wanted to be something structured and always thought being a solider was cool so I wanted to be a soldier as a kid.\r\n\r\nWhat about your childhood, what was parenting style and discipline?\r\n\r\nSo uh my mom was definitely always the ruler of the household uh she said something everyone goes by it, my dad was always more of the supportive dad. Supported what she said of course but also behind her back helps us out uh he could also be strict at times too especially for me too since I\u2019m the oldest boy. \r\n\r\nWhat was discipline like? Spanking?\r\n\r\nUh young age there was spanking and then when I got a little too old for that they would just make me sit in my room. \r\n\r\nWhat about your teenage years?\r\n\r\nUh teenage years I just uh did a lot of skip school and try to go get McDonalds uh \u2026 other than that just go mess around in the desert on the rocks you know. \r\n\r\nWould you say that in school, how focused were you?\r\n\r\nUh it depends on what the class was I liked history I liked of course PE but math I hated math but always understood it very well so I was always in the accelerated math classes but didn\u2019t want to sit in the class and do it so I would always be the joker in the class or just sit in the class and doodle. \r\n\r\nTell me more about your sports experience, football, what you liked about it and didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nUh I liked the teamwork, just like the competitiveness of it, of course the big stadium lights. \r\n\r\nHow do you think that might have played into it?\r\n\r\nUh definitely you have to work as a team here if you can\u2019t be a team player then you have like rips and tears. Everything works better as a team of course there\u2019s also like individual work here just like football if you\u2019re not going to go out on your own and workout its not going to correlate like skillswise \u2026 it just helps you with like you got to win the big game all the time.\r\n\r\nWhat about the last five years before BUD/S? Highschool straight to bootcamp then BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYes high school straight to bootcamp and then BUD/S. \r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nUhm no looking back at it it was like really short when I graduated and joined the Navy but uh I had been thinking about it for years prior it was just finally time to be serious.\r\n\r\nWhat about tattoos, impulsive behaviors like speeding tickets?\r\n\r\nNo I don\u2019t have any speeding tickets. I want to get a tattoo but you know, got to wait. \r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh just the every day you got to wake up and you know its not going to be fun but you got to get through it but everyone else has got to do it too. \r\n\r\nWhat helped you get through that? That\u2019s a long time to have to get through. \r\n\r\nYou find guys who you work with who are you know your same height and in the same boat crew with them and they\u2019re guys who want to be here too and you just push each other and just joke around when you can and it just makes the day go by a little bit faster. \r\n\r\nWhat about for you? Since you\u2019re younger than a lot of people, kind of the outlier, was it harder to get people to be a part of your support group?\r\n\r\nNo I would say that I was kind of like the younger brother who is easy to talk to, you know the older guys can be a little scary to talk to but I\u2019m just easy to talk to and you know I have a lot to learn too so they just come and coach and teach too.\r\n\r\nWhat about anything you did physical, mental, or spiritual that helped you get through this process?\r\n\r\nUm didn\u2019t do anything physically besides just trying to eat more calories just try to think about what I didn\u2019t do good at what I need to do better. \r\n\r\nAny spiritual component for you?\r\n\r\nUm sometimes I would pray a little bit here and there, but not on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nAnytime you had to make a difficult decision here? Ethical or moral or personal or watching someone else do something?\r\n\r\nUh it was hard, you think a lot about it and then you ask your friend what would they do. I can\u2019t really think of anything that comes to mind though. \r\n\r\nWhy do you think that you were successful in BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh I\u2019m stubborn. \r\n\r\nTalk to me a little bit about that. \r\n\r\nUh if I put my mind to something its going to stay there a while and \u2026 its just like \u2026 I don\u2019t want to get up and leave and then have to try this later its just like do it now and it sucks but whatever you\u2019ll live. \r\n\r\nAnything that you noticed about the people who made it verse those who quit? Specifically those who quit? \r\n\r\nUm I always felt like they had like something always like limiting them like mentally I\u2019m not sure if they were uncertain of their capabilities or uh they just didn\u2019t like being hurt or training but I could tell guys who made it could suck it up or they\u2019ll find something to laugh about.\r\n\r\nDoes laughter play a big role in getting through this?\r\n\r\nUh at times yeah, especially after you get through something hard it helps like just relieve just a little bit of stress and then get focused on the next task. \r\n\r\nHow has this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve definitely matured uh it\u2019s taught me a lot of like how hard work can get you anywhere you got to go I\u2019ve never really experienced that before in high school. Just shows like if you\u2019re willing you can do anything. \r\n\r\nAnything else you think I should have asked you that I didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nNope. \r\n\r\nWell you\u2019re all done then, congratulations and good luck. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: MCVICKERS\r\n\r\nDate: 13 AUG 20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 123\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 20:08\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it ok if I record this interview?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nAnd what is your particpant ID?\r\n\r\n123. \r\n\r\nOk easy questions first, when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think we got here June 10 of 2019. \r\n\r\nAnd you were in 338?\r\n\r\nYeah originally. \r\nWhen did you get rolled into 339?\r\n\r\nIt was after Lifesaving in First Phase. \r\n\r\nWhen that happens do you go back to the beginning of first phase?\r\n\r\nNo you jump in with the next class after Hell Week.\r\n\r\nWell that\u2019s good. \r\nYes yes. \r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nThree. \r\n\r\nAnd what\u2019s the birth order?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m the oldest and then I have a 25 soon to be 26 year old sister, a 16 year old brother, and an 8 year old brother. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your parent situation? Two parent household?\r\n\r\nUh yeah, divorced at I think I was like two so separate households from then on and then \u2026 kinda bounced school districts in the middle of high school like in 10th grade I went from living with my mom my whole life to living with my dad so dealt with that whole move and then switching of the schools and then unfortunately after college I was almost done with college I moved to Philadelphia to do so and then I lost my father \u2026 so then came after college moved in with my aunt and uncle while looking for a job. \r\n\r\nSo where did you grow up?\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania. \r\n\r\nAnd then you went to school in Philadelphia?\r\n\r\nYeah right outside of Philly it\u2019s called Eastern University. \r\n\r\nAh I know the area. \r\n\r\nAre you from there?\r\n\r\nNo I\u2019m actually from Maryland but I know the area\r\n\r\nSo you grew up with your father starting midway through highschool and then you don\u2019t have to share but can I ask why you moved in midway through high school?\r\n\r\nUm yeah that\u2019s fine my mom was going through another divorce and we had to move out of that house into a town house and was going through the typical teenage youth not really getting along at the moment so she kicked me out and then I moved in with him. \r\n\r\nOk and then your sisters are they full sisters or half?\r\n\r\nOne sister is full sister and then the 16 year old is on my mom\u2019s side and 8 year old is on my dad\u2019s side. \r\n\r\nAny life changing experiences prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm definitely my dad passing away. \r\n\r\nWas that a surprise?\r\n\r\nKind of but not really \u2026 so he ended up being diagnosed with cancer, fought it, won it. Healed and then took a huge blow and it just went downhill fast. So I actually was in college, quite college and came back to try to help out with that and then after went back to college. \r\n\r\nAnd how long did you take off college?\r\n\r\nA semester. \r\nAnd then how do you think that factored into your experience here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh I just \u2026 anytime that it got hard you just think back on those moments because that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever gone through. Because you think about your dad he\u2019s your mentor \u2026 your huge dad he\u2019s like 6\u20191\u201d 240 lbs just solid muscle, worked construction. Have him every weekend and every week during the summer. That man who can lift cinder blocks for days and then he can\u2019t even get out of the tub. Just helping him drive places and helping him get in and out of bed that just took more of a toll than anything so anytime it got tough out here just thinking that if I was in pain how was he doing what he went through. \r\n\r\nTell me about your personality and how you think it contributed to going through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI mean the hard working aspect \u2026 I think the stubborness is number one honestly that whole factor of when people tell you to quit or don\u2019t think you can do something the stubborn factor just outweighs everything because now I definitely will just because you don\u2019t think I can. \u2026 Uh definitely humor you know I would say that\u2019s a huge part of it \u2026 having a good laugh whenever shit hits the fan because they try to get you down all the time so just whenever you would find a way or find people to make one thing funny to aleviate that stress or pain that\u2019s happening so yeah I think that\u2019s huge that stubborness or finding humor in things. \r\n\r\nWhat about your family background made you want to become a SEAL?\r\n\r\nAlways just trying to be the best in any aspect whether its growing up I played a lot of sports so trying to be the best guy out there or the competitiveness so trying to win everything so going through that and growing up hearing different options of what you want to do and you hear that they\u2019re the best in the world it definitely peaks an interest because where better to go than to be the best of the best. \r\n\r\nWhat about any military in your family or friends that were SEALs?\r\n\r\nNo it was just my one buddy who would always talk about it with me in wrestling in high school but unfortunately he didn\u2019t end up going through with me. \r\n\r\nSo what was your parents discipline style, spanking, time out, toys taken away?\r\n\r\nUm I would say a little bit of everything so like the wooden spoon whenever something would happen \u2026 or getting sent to your room \u2026 I guess that isn\u2019t a punishment\u2026 but yeah it was the wooden spoon until one time they hit me with it and it broke and I laughed and I guess that was the end of that. \r\n\r\nSo we talked about your teenage years but tell me about activities you did, sports etc. \r\n\r\nSo growing up it was sports all year round. It went from baseball in the spring to wrestling in the winter and football in the fall so I didn\u2019t even have a break and sometimes I would miss the first couple practices because that other season was still going on so it was just like day in and day out \u2026 and that wasn\u2019t like a punishment I liked that. \r\n\r\nWas there a sport that you liked better than the other?\r\n\r\nUm when I was young no whatever sport I was doing was my favorite of all time but when I got older I had to give up football in high school because there wasn\u2019t enough time and then when I got to college I had to give up wrestling just because baseball took over everything. \r\n\r\nSo you played baseball in college?\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nSo talk to me a little bit about the last 5 years before coming here. So you leave college then what?\r\n\r\nSo in college in my senior year \u2026 I tore my shoulder apart, had surgery on my rotator labrum and bicep tendon so that was part of the recovery. I immediately came home and got a job working at a warehouse for Amazon and while I was doing that just from playing sports growing up I was big into weight lifting so that was a big part of my regiment then so I would say it was probably about a year into working at Amazon I decided that I just wasn\u2019t \u2026 this was not for me I was not enjoying it I didn\u2019t like working behind a desk and if I was going to pursue this thing with the Navy you know I was already twenty-six so time was already dwindling down. \r\n\r\nSo then did you go to boot camp?\r\n\r\nYep so then boot camp and I had to jump through all these hoops because of my shoulder but then yeah it was bootcamp for two months then Prep for a month and then out here to start this process. \r\n\r\nSo what year did you graduate college?\r\n\r\n2015. \r\n\r\nThen you worked at Amazon for how long?\r\n\r\nUp until I left so 2018 so about 3 years. \r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\n(laughing) I guess it depends on who you ask. \r\n\r\nSo for us I guess it would be any tattoos that you got on a whim. \r\n\r\nNo I mean I do have two tattoos but nothing too crazy. \r\n\r\nAny speeding tickets or crazy purchases. \r\n\r\nNo I don\u2019t think I have any speeding tickets. Purchases \u2026 no not really. So I guess not \u2026 not for this aspect anyways. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think the most challenging component of BUD/S was?\r\n\r\nOo... I would say just the grind. It didn\u2019t really matter what Phase you were in either. So like First Phase obviously you\u2019re getting beaten down just with the physical and metnal aspect of it but then even when that day is done you know that day will end you have to go back and clean all your gear for the next day and wake up super early and you know that even though you are sore and tired you have to willingly wake up and face these instructors that you know will destroy you again. So I think it\u2019s just that constant wake up, get destroyed, go to sleep, sore, tired, wake up, and then it\u2019s the same thing in Second Phase with disciplinary actions so you\u2019re still getting wet and sandy so even though you made it past all that stuff in First Phase you think it would start to get easier but it doesn\u2019t. And now you\u2019re diving so you still have all that stuff but now you\u2019re exhausted from diving. And then the island obviously you\u2019re out working every single day and even the weekends you\u2019re still waking up super early. So I guess its just the mental grind. \r\n\r\nSo how do you get through that?\r\n\r\nUh practice maybe I guess it depends on growing up or how you grew up so maybe people who weren\u2019t exposed to sports or weren\u2019t exposed to that grinding aspect \u2026 I don\u2019t know. \r\n\r\nIs there anything that you did growing up that you think prepared you?\r\n\r\nI mean I just worked my ass off every single day \u2026 and I mean I didn\u2019t have someone there so no one made me do it so I guess just the willing to do it myself and I guess just like the I can do it myself. You know with sports the coaches make you do it but it\u2019s that off time I think that\u2019s where you make your money. \r\n\r\nDid you feel like you were supported by the group here?\r\n\r\nI think everyone is pretty much on the same page I mean you definitely have your outcasts but I don\u2019t think those people are here anymore and I couldn\u2019t tell you why they\u2019re outcasts but pretty much everyone here is similar I mean we\u2019re all meatheads in the gym and we\u2019re all pretty stubborn when it comes to being told you\u2019re not doing something so at first I was a little nervous about that thinking there may be too many cooks in the kitchen but I think it was the complete opposite you know because I think everyone is so willing to help everyone out because we\u2019re all so similar minded and we all have the same goals and it\u2019s not like I want to be here and have to compete against you it\u2019s more like we\u2019re all here so let\u2019s help each other out and make each other better and see how great we can become as a team?\r\n\r\nWhat about any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that helped you push through here?\r\n\r\nUm\u2026 like religious factors?\r\n\r\nYeah if any at all. \r\n\r\nI would say my number one go to whenever it got tough was dad. That was number one every single time, no doubt that was on my mind. \r\n\r\nWas there anytime you had to make a difficult decision, moral or ethical whether it was personal or watching someone else?\r\n\r\nMyself no but one of my good buddies did DOR during Hell Week and we met in boot camp and they just kind of stole my best friend. But we had to have a tough conversation in the middle of Hell Week during chow you know me trying to convince him to not but then his reasons why and just watch him ring the bell after and just that image and he talked about those few months during boot camp and seeing that image that just wasn\u2019t very fun. But other than that no I don\u2019t think that any of my decisions were that tough. \r\n\r\nSo was that a conversation that you had to have with him and say that wasn\u2019t a good decision?\r\n\r\nYeah but other than that I don\u2019t think I really had any of those tough decisions \u2026 none that I remember. \r\n\r\nWhy do you think that you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm I guess what I said before just the stubbornness you know the grind from everything just being able to handle that and not get distressed because people are yelling or anything like that so yeah I think just the constant grind and being able to handle that. \r\n\r\nAnything different about the people that made it compared to those that quit?\r\n\r\nAntying different\u2026 I mean I guess all the people that DOR they all had a different personality than these guys a less humble factor. All of these guys when you talk to them \u2026 well I guess you are making them talk about themselves but when you don\u2019t when people aren\u2019t they usually don\u2019t and I think that that humbleness because all of those people that DOR they were all talking about how great they are and they were talking about how they can\u2019t wait to do this next evolution even though everyone knows that evolution sucks so I guess just a different attitude towards things. \r\nHow has this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\nUm I mean\u2026 I still think I\u2019m still the same person that I was \u2026 I mean any mental aspect or \u2026 I don\u2019t think that \u2026 no I don\u2019t think that it really has changed me much I think I\u2019m still the same person that I was in every aspect. \r\n\r\nAnything else that you think I should have asked to help our study?\r\n\r\nNo not that I can think of. \r\nOk well then thank you I\u2019m all done with you, congratulations. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jonathan Savage \r\n\r\nDate:10AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 124\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 15:50\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch \r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat time is it?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh 7:45\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk I am just going to ask you a series of questions and you can answer them, you know, as well as you can. Umm, When did you start BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, I reported to BUDS in March of 2019 and I finally got into a class in June.

So I had like a step mom with my father and my mother had several boyfriends as I grew up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you had a dad, and a stepmom, and a mom, and partners. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, were your parents divorced? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were never married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were never married. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep.Oh, and my little brother and little sister are half brother with my father and my step mom. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour little brother and your little sister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your relationship\u2026 What was your relationship with your parents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, so, they were, my whole life they were very amicable. So, umm, there were times that the relationship was stress, on uhh, stress on myself and my older sister. But, that was, more often it was not the case. I mean, we would like to Christmas and stuff together, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What is the gender of each sibling? (align with birth order)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, what life changing experiences have happened in your life prior to BUDS?\r\n\r\nUmm, working backwards from the most recent. I would say, after college I moved to New York, City, umm, I had to navigate that. That was huge confidence building exercise I would say. Umm, and also, I grew up in a farm town, very small, and when I moved to college, kinda seeing larger towns, like stop lights and stuff. That was, uhh, that was very interesting. Uhh, yeah, I guess, uhh, I wrestled my whole life, so that had a huge impact on my whole life, and how I do things, how I approach things. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere did you grow up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan. So, how do you think those experiences that you talk about, moving to New York, growing up in a farm town, eventually going to college in a larger city\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnn Arbor, yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Oh, you went to Michigan, ok. Umm, how do you think those events factored into your experience at BUDS? \r\n\r\nA lot of those are like confidence building, the ones that I chose to share with you, are confidence building umm  experiences. So you know I came here knowing that I was going to lead this, you know there was no question that whether, whether or not it was going to happen. I knew that it was going to happen, and I think it is because of those things in my path. Finding my own way here, you know that really helped. There was no uncertainty in my mind when I got here. It was impacted me was that I knew I was going to do the work that I had to get done. So you know...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUDS?\r\n\r\nI think well, you know, I consistently do well on like peer evals and they way that I can build relationships here. That just goes a lot farther than what people think. If you are kinda going at this alone, it is going to be much harder versus just like being able to build bonds with guys early on and umm, I think my personality, not just work ethic alone, personality definitely plays into that, just being uhh, able to communicate well with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that lead you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community. So, what is meant by that is, do you have any SEALs as family or friends? Uhh, or any military family or friends? \r\n\r\nUhh, so no family, but umm, I wrestled at Michigan and I was interested in going into the CIA. During Alumni weekend, there was a former Michigan wrestler who is a SEAL Team 6 officer, I think in town, I wanted to meet with him, talk about how to get into intelligence work or whatever. We ended up just kind of talking about his career and uhh, and you know what it was like in the teams. And umm, yeah from there, he has been my mentor, and I would, I would say that is the one person who has influenced my decision then. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So tell me a little bit about your childhood, umm, how were disciplined as a child? Spanking? Timeouts?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, my mom, I\u2019d get, I\u2019d get, my mom was pretty hard on me. But you know, I mean, you know, it was definitely not out of like, immaturity or whatever, or like her. I think she had a way that she wanted us to behave and when we didn\u2019t she would come down on us hard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFather? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, my dad was, I - I don\u2019t know, not that he didn\u2019t respect my mom, I just think that my dad, you know, would tell me to do something and I was like, ok, you know there is no need to bump up against him. Umm, you know, I mean he never really, hit me or my sister. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me it was always, just wait till your dad gets home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah, so I am lucky that he was a lot more calm then my mom. She would just fly off. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Yeah, huh, mine too. Did you move, uhh, around throughout your childhood or teenage years?\r\n\r\nI mean we, uhh, we always live in the same \u2026 We moved houses or whatever, but we always lived in the same small town or the surrounding farmlands of that town I\u2019d say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your teenage years. Did you participate in a team sport? Wrestling? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy whole life, since I was 6 years old. Uhh you know, through college, and then you know I also played football, but you know, I was not very uhh. I didn\u2019t find any success in football.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last 5 years of your life (prior to BUD/S training)?  Would you consider yourself impulsive?  For example, do you have any tattoos?  \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s check them time here. You know we are supposed to keep it to 15 minutes. You know I played football until everybody sprouted above me. What have you done in the last 5 years prior to BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, I was working in Manhattan. Finance job, and then I spent a year in Michigan as a financial advisor. Let\u2019s see, it's 2020, I guess I would have just been finishing up college five years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo then you joined the Navy after uhh \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou joined the Navy after then or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I - I was backtracking, I graduated college, worked as a financial advisor in Michigan, and then worked for three years in Manhattan, and then joined the Navy. Sorry, I did that kind of backwards. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm, no. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample that they ask is here is uhh, whether you have any tattoos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, but uhh, I mean I know a lot of people who have tattoos and they thought a long time about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you don\u2019t have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any tattoos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know, I have thought about getting one for 20 years. Almost got one when I finished basic training in the Army. Glad I didn\u2019t. What was the most challenging component of BUDS?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm, I don\u2019t know, maybe just like the stress of like if you mess something up, they\u2019ll you know, you can get sent away for making like a small mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\nUmm, I think it was just like I made my decision that I was going to finish it before I got here and there was like, there was nothing that was going to change my mind. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S?

Did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What practices (physical, mental, spiritual) did you utilize to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nUmm, well, physical, I like think its just grit and umm, yeah there is no like mantras or secrets or anything. You just deal with the pain and compartmentalize it uhh as best you can and uhh I think that\u2019s like, so the compartmentalizing of the like, the uhh, tasks ahead. I got pretty good from wrestling, just having to cut weight and kind of work through a whole season, so umm, I\u2019d say those were the biggest ones I used. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\nYeah, so, uhh, When I made difficult decisions, I would think about how it would affect the group of guys around me and not just like immediately but like moving forward. Umm, for instance, I guy made a mistake, does it really make sense to go tell the instructor staff and kind of lose the respect and trust of the class as a whole?  Just given that specific example they are talking about. Not many difficult decisions need to be made in BUDS though, it is all pretty much straight forward and easy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Can you provide an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm, I just didn\u2019t give myself any other option. Like, people would ask me what my plan B is and like there is no, this is the only plan I have right now. Its kinda like, so I got rolled, and then I almost failed another pool evolution and I remember thinking to myself, if I get dropped, it would be so much worse than dying. Because it would be like the end of, I don\u2019t even know where my life would go after that. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo I just think that like convincing yourself that like no matter what happens you\u2019re going to make it through, giving yourself no other option, umm, that's why I think I did well here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those that did not make it?  If so, can you describe those differences?\r\n\r\nNope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nIt Hasn\u2019t. Yeah, so umm, I do think that uhh, like, kind of touched on family life, and I grew up in a very unstable home. Umm, I mean, uhh, both parents were felons. There was drug abuse in all my family around too. So I think that that independence that I had at a very young age certainly helped me get through umm. And like the studies about grit and heariness, I have been practicing that since I was a very young child. So, uhh, those, I would say that more than anything. From like a young age, having to deal with, you know, being responsible for people around me making bad decisions and cutting my own path was the biggest factor of why I am here.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER

I\u2019ll be very frugal for a while and then whatever I\u2019l like treat myself kinda thing  but I see myself as of saving up for like certain things like for all those trips I would save up for awhile and kinda like oh stay away you know even the odds for a little while\r\n\r\nA: uh ok, do you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\n125: I do not\r\n\r\nA: how about speeding tickets\r\n\r\n125: uh not none

it could be a day or an event \r\n\r\n125: so I hate the cold so that was bad for me\r\n\r\nA: oik\r\n\r\n125: uh I think what was probably the worst was life saving for me uh I just had I like saving an instructor and I had to grab a big guy like and I kicked him in the groin accidentally and he was not not too comfortable with that um so usually you swim to the otherside of the pool and he meets you half-way and he chased me all the way across the pool and then some so I\u2019m seeing stars by the end of that about to pass out uh whole life saving and just like everyday grind\r\n\r\nA:ok everyday\r\n\r\n125: it started to add up \r\n\r\nA:ok so when it got hard what motivated you to push through\r\n\r\n125: um on a daily basis it was just like I can\u2019t wait to go to my bed \r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n125: and then I\u2019d just keep saying in my head the faster you go the faster you\u2019re done\r\n\r\nA:ok\r\n\r\n125: kinda deal so I\u2019d do that for runs um for swims and all those like like earned yourself a little break here and there\r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n125: and that just helped me a lot \r\n\r\nA: were there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used for the daily challenges \r\n\r\n125: um I would do I\u2019m catholic so I\u2019d like pray every night kinda deal \r\n\r\nA: ok you\u2019d pray \r\n\r\n125: nothing insane, just before  I go to bed \r\n\r\nA: do you do like rosary or like \r\n\r\n125: no I just like in my head kinda thing   \r\n\r\nA: do you do like meditation or stretching routine where you do something physical \r\n\r\n125: um I would stretch um I would start getting like kina hip pain a little bit so I would have to stretch out my hip spend a little more time at night doing that\r\n\r\nA: ok\r\n\r\n125: and then just hitting the verbal way harder whole friend group was just and like \r\n\r\nA: so like a team psych outs \r\n\r\n125: and then my roommate and I back in first and second phase um it was just communal complaining just lets you see a funny side of stuff kinda makes you less angry there\u2019s that so   \r\n\r\nA: ya ok ummm so like like a vent session \r\n\r\n125: essentially \r\n\r\nA: um come from the academy with a sense of \r\n\r\n125: definitely\r\n\r\nA: ah did you make any tough decision while you were training at buds and if you did what went through your mind when you making a decision \r\n\r\n125: tough in like \r\n\r\nA: like you were faced with something and you said uhh I gotta decide whether to do A or B and I\u2019m having a hard time with both of them \r\n\r\n125: nothing nothing monumental like or earth shattering stuff but there\u2019d be times when you're running on skill and jump in the ocean but since you\u2019re already wet you don\u2019t need to cause they won\u2019t notice kinda thing umm and and you would get back faster and it paid if you got back faste they\u2019d be like ok you guys go you\u2019re good and keep the slower guys so there was kinda that      \r\n\r\nA: so the temptation to cut corners\r\n\r\n125: right ya \r\n\r\nA: so what went through your head and what did you decide \r\n\r\n125: umm well the first time the round we were in BO um I like did did the whole I\u2019m already wet I can turn around \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n125: um and then kinda thought about it and then some of our friends were like hey man you you didn\u2019t even do it not the second time we\u2019re already wet just gotta do it \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n125: so I just thought about that and stopped and then um ya just the the knowing that as it comes as we used to say as an officer or whatever people are still looking at you so kinda keep it good professional \r\n\r\nA: ok uh why do you think that you were successful in completing buds and why do you think others didn\u2019t\r\n\r\n125: um I think coming from the academy we knew a little more what to expect you are around it more I had pretty good resources um Rick Joslin over in the leadership hall he\u2019s really good at kinda giving us insight \r\n\r\nA: ya \r\n\r\n125: and helping us out um and then I had my family that I reach out to as well\r\n\r\nA:ok \r\n\r\n125:just really good community personal face\r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n125: which was great \r\n\r\nA: ok \r\n\r\n125: uh and then just going back to the personal traits from whatever I said earlier, um I forgot what I was but I think that helped out \r\n\r\nA: ya so what about the people that didn\u2019t make it through  \r\n\r\n125: I think again they probably didn\u2019t have the good exposure like knowing what to expect like they show up these big meaty guys and thinking they're gonna throw logs and boats around and it\u2019s a lot of running and stuff and then the daily grind can be is more than just what they account for I think they catch people off guard and the younger guys I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a maturity stand point and they\u2019re more focused on the near and now which like I definitely couldn't do this at 18 so guys that do um just everyday I\u2019m impressed by that um I think the guys sometimes come for like the wrong reasons too like I wanna be cool or whatever or just watched to much movies umm ya I think it;s a big one and  a lot of people just sometimes they hurt themselves and that catches up pretty quick \r\n\r\nA: ok do you think this experience has changed you as a person\r\n\r\n125: I think so \r\n\r\nA: how \r\n\r\n125: Uh I think I can handle stress pretty well now like it doesn;t shock shock and awe as much\r\n\r\nA: so better coping skills \r\n\r\n125: better coping skilling and I think the word they were using was compartmentalize just kinda like break down problems as they rather then focus on the whole deal like um like cluster you\u2019re in at the moment um I think it\u2019s cool seeing like it was not fun at all or anything but it was cool seeing how much you can go through and still go um physically and um not sleeping for a while \r\n\r\nA: so like confidence\r\n\r\n125: confidence so like physical confidence whatever knowing that you can do it if you had too is a nice nice fall back \r\n\r\nA: ya anything else that I didn\u2019t cover that you wanted to share or that you think we should cover \r\n\r\n125: not really \r\n\r\nA: I\u2019m gonna hit stop \r\n\r\n125: ok \r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Connor

Uhh leaving, leaving home and then going to the academy so kinda just being on my own I guess. I didn\u2019t know anyone when I went there and didn\u2019t like...I had no military family so it was all very new to me.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: Um, I guess having to make that adjustment.Umm, yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So um, anything like that was like kind of super monumental in your childhood umm that just I don\u2019t know kinda changed the trajectory of your life at all\r\n\r\n#130: Umm, honestly I think I did this project in like the 6th grade um interviewed my grandparents about World War II and I kinda got hooked on the idea and-and I told myself that I would look I\u2018d never close any doors even like throughout highschool um so I'm not gonna close doors, I'm gonna figure out what I want to do and kinda run with it and um nothing really came to mind um like any other profession that I wanted to do even when I was a kid I wanted to be a baseball player but like every kid wants to be an astronaut or firefighter, or something-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: - so I didn\u2019t think that was really significant but I-I-I think kinda getting that sense of patriotism or learning a lot from my grandparents at that time kinda what it meant to get through hard times and stuff um yeah that kind of inspired me. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now had they both been in WWII?\r\n\r\n#130: So my grandfather served on Okinawa uh he went after the campaign like he was kind of an occupying force but umm I don\u2019t know that was just fascinating my grandmother was at home and just kind of gutting out the time. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, um how do you think those experiences maybe factored into your experiences here at BUD/s?\r\n\r\n#130: Umm, you have to be flexible you have to be like willing to adjust to things-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: -and if you can\u2019t then you\u2019re kind of gunna go crazy and I think throughout my life like whether it was-usually it was a new school but um I didn't know anybody there and I always had to figure things out on my own and kind of make things for myself I guess umm\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you move around a lot as a child?\r\n\r\n#130: No, it was just um I think like 3rd grade to 4th grade went to a new school didn't know anybody um restarting like making friends going into highschool didn\u2019t know anyone had to make friends going into the academy didn't know anybody um honestly like this was kind of the first place where like I knew people going into it which is weird that it would be here but um I knew a lot of people that were coming into this pipeline and um yeah I think being able to- to kind of be flexible and adjust like I said is kind of what helped me be successful. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, um how would you describe your personality and how do you think your personality contributed to you getting through BUD/s?\r\n\r\n#130: Umm, I think \u2026I\u2019m laid back um but when I need to get something done I can- I can be super focused and um I guess the laid back nature allows me to decompress after having these extensive um intense focus umm yeah um \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um do you consider yourself kind of a calm person?\r\n\r\n#130: Calm?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: A calm person.\r\n\r\n#130:Yeah, I would.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Have you always been that way?\r\n\r\n#130: Yes, yeah\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, describe kind of your background that  led you to want to join the seal community.\r\n\r\n#130: Uhh, so my uncle in 2005 came back from Afghanistan and he was shot 8 times and um just in a real weird spot medically and was done with the military and umm didn't really know him before because he was gone and then got to know that he was in Army SF and when  I was in highschool kinda got interested in the military more as far as making it a  profession and uh I went to him and-and-and he exposed me to the SOF community, he told me about the SEALs , his experience with them and um I kinda from there was just like yeah I\u2019m gonna go for this thing. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, what about your early childhood so kind of pre-highschool years what was that like?\r\n\r\n#130: Yeah, so I-I played baseball and basketball um my dad really...my uh I think my dad worked really hard growing up. He-he had a rough upbringing and um kind of instilled like some discipline in me and my cousin at the time my uh- he was playing baseball he ended up getting drafted into the MLB and tore his ACL and-and-and you know that fizzled out but like was on track to be something special and um when he was in highschool he was like doing these crazy workouts in my mind at the time they were like these crazy workouts to be stronger and everything and at a very young age I started training myself and I dont think its necessarily anything that developed me later on uh physically perse but the discipline that I started I guess at an early age I think made it easier to continue that kind of life um as I got older just became like a new normal um because I know like my teachers I was like kind of a weird kid I guess in that sense because I wanted to be good at baseball but I\u2019m also this like fourth grader and my teachers like asked my parents why I was doing pushups and situps at recess while the other kids are like playing and looking back on it yeah thats incredibly weird-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, yeah\r\n\r\n#130: -um but I guess it was just something I did because I wanted to be at that level he was at for whatever reason I just thought it was special.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What did uh your parents parenting style what was that like?\r\n\r\n#130: Umm fair. Umm very loving but um (long pause). They were very serious all the time because they were working, they were working all the time and they didn't really have time it felt like to for them to I guess do much with us. They didnt do a lot with us. \r\n\r\nInterviewer:Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: Um yeah I guess one-if-maybe-like my earliest memories are like if I\u2019m-if I was interacting with my parents like I was getting in trouble. Yeah-yeah um me and my brothers just like-. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. Um so, what about just how what was their discipline approach? Did they spank you, did you have timeouts? Um, did they take away toys?\r\n\r\n#130: Yeah it was-it was um physical discipline. It was- they would ground us I guess it was more physical than the uh, the than like the other stuff I guess-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: -but it wasn't anything that was like too aggressive or something that's like worth fighting\r\n\r\nInterviewer:Yeah. What about teenage years? Um well I may have asked this before but did you move around at all in your childhood?\r\n\r\n#130: Um we spent a couple years um at my grandparents house because our-we were getting our house worked on we decided to renovate it instead of move out to the suburbs and uh so we stayed out there at their house for a couple years um and that was interesting just being in a different neighborhood but that was the only moving I'd ever done. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Where-where are you-\r\n\r\n#130: Chicago.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Chicago, okay. The city?\r\n\r\n#130:Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer:Uh, what about sports? Did you participate in sports in your teenage years, if so what sports?\r\n\r\n#130:So I got to highschool I did uh basketball, swimming, and football. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Um any other like team activities, not necessarily sports, but something as a group?\r\n\r\n#130: Mm, no. Football dominated my life. That was-that was everything so I guess that, I didn't really have anything outside of it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Was anything else notable from your teenage years? I don't know was kinda formative in that time frame?\r\n\r\n#130: No really it was- it was honestly just um like I had this interest in the military from my uncle and then the football like thing my coaches saw something in me um they thought I had a lot of potential as- as far as uhh taking a role in leading the team and um they half of them had a military background the others were like college athle- or they played football in college um some at D1 schools and that immersion, kinda like the discipline and and being that super athlete I think kinda it was like really good timing both learning about the stuff with my uncle and then and then being on this-on this team. But it was more about like \u201care you a good teammate are you gonna be like a good man, are you gonna do all these things, and um it was more- it wasn't as much of like are you gonna perform on the field like that was very important but the most important stuff was you know how you are as a man, how are you developing as a person um yeah can you be a good teammate.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your last 5 years leading up to BUD/s, what were they like? You said academy but did you go somewhere after that or straight here?\r\n\r\n#130:Uh so I went to the prep school in rhode island for a year and then I went to the academy for the next four.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you (indiscernible) at the academy?\r\n\r\n#130: No so I didn't do anything. Um I spent a couple years skydiving um with the parachute team. I trained really hard to be on the triathlon team that was something that I guess is notable is I trained super hard um to be on the triathlon team and failed both times and kinda had this moment when um I was at the academy you know I was like you want to be a SEAL um and I- and I knew being on that team was going to push me in that direction as far as like being -being the athlete that I wanted to be and I was like \u201cman if you can\u2019t like make this team you know I kinda had this moment of doubt um and it crushed me because I had never trained for anything like that hard and I just kinda flipped a switch I was just like lets keep pushing and see this thing through. And then it brought me into skydiving and doing other stuff. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um would you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\n#130: Yes\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And could you describe something that involves impulsive behavior?\r\n\r\n#130: Sure, uh, so skydiving is kinda the first one. Uhhh, getting a motorcycle was another one. Umm, my first tattoo was on impulse. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: How many tattoos do you have?\r\n\r\n#130: Eight.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow, that\u2019s a lot.\r\n\r\n#130: Yeah\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So were they all impulsive like tattoos?\r\n\r\n#130: No no, it kind of developed from like wha-like an interest in it kinda like honestly with everything else, I kinda had an interest in it and then I got deeper into it whether it was jumping or building up to like my own bike or -\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: -kinda the artistic aspects to a tattoo\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: more so than kind of the tough guy kind of approach to it um. Ummm, yeah I guess probably just like small insignificant things I can do on impulse but nothing that's like gonna take me off a straight path like I'm going to do anything bad. I never feel like it's uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about um any like speeding tickets or-\r\n\r\n#130: No. Yeah, no I\u2019ve never gotten a ticket. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about what motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#130: I think it's a combination of purpose and excitement\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: Um like I want to feel something I wanna feel like uh yeah I'm getting something out of what I'm doing.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: But then also know I'm doing it for the right reason?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And now kind of talking specifically about BUD/s if you think about the most challenging component whether its a specific day or event at BUD/s what was that?\r\n\r\n#130: My-my hardest day was I got SIPE for the second time and it was way worse than I had had it before. And um I started throwing up blood on the beach and I finished the evolution and we were like laying on the surf and coughing up blood and then um we were about to go into a boat race and we were getting into the height line and guys were telling me \u201cdude you have to go to medical like you can't keep going and um it kinda felt like a tightrope quit I guess in a way-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130:-because I wanted to stay but at the same time like I didn't want to get guys hurt-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: -and it felt like a pretty big like moment of defeat for me and then of course like getting made fun of by instructors \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah yeah\r\n\r\n#130: I think I ended up having like 80-82 percent - my O2 levels at 82 percent at the time and I was able to come back from it after the weekend but um that was a moment where I was like wow like this is the worst thing I've ever felt um and then the uh yeah another one would\u2019ve been like getting rolled my-my first time getting like emotionally or not emotional - just getting invested in the class and then-and then getting rolled from it that was tough. But definitely the - the throwing up blood was like the shock factor of it like happening and then um the stuff that I explained. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what um what helped you push through that?\r\n\r\n#130: I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I don't know just maybe its like a full retard, I don\u2019t-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Is there a group dynamic that you think helps with (indiscernible)\r\n\r\n#130: Oh for sure yeah, no I mean uh even though like BUD/s has been the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done its been I think it's absolutely hilarious like it\u2019s the - I\u2019ve laughed so hard um going through every phase of training and I think that helps like with it a lot. Especially with the last class that I was in like going between the three classes it's just like every day was hilarious. Every day was hard but the-the camaraderie like just the boys made it, sweet. Made it a lot of fun. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: (Indiscernible) physical mental spiritual to get through BUD/s?\r\n\r\n#130: Uhh, spiritual Im catholic um so theres that. Mental umm yeah just gut it out. There wasn\u2019t like a specific thing I would think about. I wanted to do it for my family. Thought about my family a lot. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: When you say family is that like parents?\r\n\r\n#130: Yeah, yeah my parents, my brothers. Like I-I wanted to make them proud. \r\n\r\n Interviewer: When you had to make a difficult decision during training at BUD/s, uh what went through your mind when you had to make that decision? Can you give an example of -\r\n\r\n#130: Um, yeah we uh we had this guy in uh first phase who like cheated on the o-course and everyone really liked him and stuff and we had it was like right before our hell week party like everyones secured hell week we\u2019re gonna go have pizza and drink beers and we were about to tell this guy like \u201chey we're telling the instructors that you cheated you're gonna get kicked out right and like essentially um and it was gonna affect the class because everyone was gonna find out and stuff so tried to handle it super carefully. And there was like this part that was like guys are coming up to me and like \u201cthis thing happened\u201d like they saw it and they didn\u2019t really want something to happen.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#130: But like they had to address it and I was like thinking like do we do something do we not do something, and then I was like you know if everyon-if this bothers people then like how can you not address this thing. It's not an insignificant thing that happened y\u2019know especially in BUD/s y\u2019know for someone to cheat something is like a moral sin. Nowadays, I don't think it was before but now guys will just like dude thats not okay and um at this point in my career its like getting in a room with some guys and deciding what to do like hey we are going to turn this guy in if he doesn\u2019t um that was that was tough. For someone who\u2019d gone to BUD/s before, had to come back, and then he was in the spot like that sucked.\r\n\r\nInterviewer:Um, why do you think you were successful at BUD/s?\r\n\r\n#130: Uh, I think building relationships with guys. Yeah. its I mean yeah it's (indiscernible). Yeah I felt like I surrounded myself with really good people not to like carry me through but everyone would always work together and would work well and I tried to I tried my best to uh to kind of foster that environment whenever I ended up being in charge of and um I had a lot of fun doing it at the same time. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about, did you notice anything different about the people that you (indiscernible)\r\n\r\n#130: In-In-\r\n\r\nInterviewer:(indiscernible)\r\n\r\n#130:Um, no because I di-I didn\u2019t. Just kinda like people are there and then they\u2019re not. \r\n\r\nInterviewer:Yeah\r\n\r\n#130: No matter what the phase like I dont think people ju- at least I never put that much thought into it cus you kinda just live like a dog, you're just in the moment. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah \r\n\r\n#130: Um, no matter what level of training youre in. You\u2019re just like okay whos gone what's the next thing youre gonna worry about. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: (too quiet)\r\n\r\n#130: I thought that would go away in first phase but it was like second and third phase too. \r\n\r\nInterviewer:(too quiet)\r\n\r\n#130: Yeah, yeah\r\n\r\nInterviewer: A lot of people said that. How\u2019d this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n#130: Uh, definitely found out uh I\u2019m way tougher than I thought I was. Um, I thought also I was gonna be - I knew I wasn\u2019t as good as the other O\u2019s physically that I was coming out here with like competing with the enlisted guys at the evolutions, its incredibly humbling like wow these guys are studs. Uh and I didnt expect - I knew they were gonna be like really tough, and like really athletic but I got to a certain point like look to my left and right and Im like wow these dudes are crushing me right now and uh it was like super impressive and like I said humbling.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer:(too quiet)\r\n\r\n#130: Okay cool. \r\n\r\nInterviewer:Thank you. Congratulations. Thanks for sitting down with me.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 20 April 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 133\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Deirdre Dixon\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, can I get your number?\r\n\r\n#133: Yes. 133. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: 133. And is it OK if I record?\r\n\r\n#133: Yes. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Great, awesome. I\u2019m gonna start out with something really easy. How many siblings do you have and what\u2019s the birth order? \r\n\r\n#133: I\u2019m the oldest and my brother is a year and a half younger than I am. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then, tell me about your life experiences. Do you have something that you would describe as your crucible or something that was really life shaping?\r\n\r\n#133: Uh, for me, I would have to say, probably uh, I\u2019m Christian, so giving myself over to Christ has been a huge part of what has gotten me through. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, so how did that impact your life at BUD/S? Or your experiences?\r\n\r\n#133: Well, being that Jesus is my rock, I relied heavily on him as far as my confidence and my strength. And, I also have a phenomenal family that is back home supporting me, a wife that has been nothing but supportive and encouraging, so that all played into *undecipherable*. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And do you think your personality had anything to do with or contribute to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, I would say a little bit, yeah. I am definitely, uhm, somebody that, you know, I believe that, you know, when given the opportunity to rise to something that is bigger than you, and the opportunity has presented itself, then why short sell yourself on that? You know, there's, I think it's one of those things where the pain, and the discomfort, and the uh, the inconvenience of the situation, it will end, so uh, it\u2019s just seeing yourself until the end.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, I\u2019m gonna ask you more, don\u2019t worry.\r\n\r\n#133: That\u2019s absolutely fine. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, tell me about your background that led you even to wanting to become a SEAL?\r\n\r\n#133: It\u2019s funny, I actually did not want to be in the military when I was younger. Uh, I always liked to play with the GI Joes and play you know soldiers and stuff like that with my brother, with, you know, plastic guns and stuff like that, but I never really saw myself in the military. I actually liked art and drawing and all that stuff. I don't know, I guess I started realizing that I had an aggressive side, I tried out lacrosse when I was in middle school, then started developing a desire to be in a sport that was a team competitive kind of thing. I really enjoyed that. And uh, as time went along, I didn't do well in college. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life. And I didn't have purpose in life. And it was hard for me to get excited about something. You know, I didn't really see what it was. And then I just kinda started looking into the military through some family friends and stuff like that. I remember watching the guardian and I thought I wanted to be a rescue swimmer. I just wanted to help people. I just thought that was awesome, putting other people\u2019s needs before yourself. And, uhm, that was kinda what led me into the military to begin with.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So tell me a little about your childhood. Like if you did something bad, how did your parents discipline you. Like if you did something bad, did they spank you? Was it time-outs?\r\n\r\n#133: No, uh, no yeah we had a switch tree. We planted it there myself. And I would go pick a switch and go hand it to my mom and yeah, that\u2019s the way it went.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Uhm, and then what about your teenage years? Did you stay in lacrosse?\r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, so yeah, stayed in lacrosse, but we did move. I grew up in Kennesaw, Georgia and uh, stayed there until middle school. My dad got an awesome new job as a nuclear engineer and uh he got a new job inNorfolk, Virginia. And uh, that was actually the first time I ever really had any exposure to the military. I never had any exposure to the military when I was growing up in Georgia. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: But isn\u2019t there a, Kennesaw, Georgia, isn\u2019t there a military college?\r\n\r\n#133: But I mean, I had, that\u2019s a little bit further. In uh, Northeastern Georgia, so I had never really seen it or anything of it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So with lacrosse you were saying you got a lot out of the team and you liked the teamwork?\r\n\r\n#133: I did. I did. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then what have you done in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S that led you to this? So what was your sequence? So you went to high school, then you went to college?\r\n\r\n#133: Yes. Uhm, well it was when I, uhm, started realizing that what the demands of the job where you would have to put yourself in a situation that, uh, could threaten your life and is already threatening the lives of the people around you that I realized the kinda training that was required would demand a, uncomfortable training method and I started discipling myself really well. I actually, for a couple years, when I would work out, I wouldn\u2019t listen to music, uhm because I wanted to see if I could find the drive within myself instead of being cheerled by music so I wanted see if I could do the gut check and find out what the hardest workout I could do to myself and do it without any motivations. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: That's very...OK. Do you consider yourself impulsive? Do you have any tattoos? Do you binge drink? \r\n\r\n#133: No, uhm. I do have a tattoo, I wouldn't consider myself impulsive though. I\u2019m actually the kind of person now, that, you know, if there\u2019s something that I want I\u2019ll, if I find it online, i'll sit on that item for a week or more, and if i'm still thinking about it then i'll buy it, if not, then it wasn't worth the buy. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, what motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, my faith, uhm, my wife, and uhm, this opportunity in general. This is a community that should have pride in itself. It\u2019s a clearly, it\u2019s earned a name, and I bet that's how a lot of guys find out about it, because it had gotten some of an audience, but they, men coming together, realizing that everybody has strengths and weaknesses, but working together to accomplish objectives that other people in the world will not have the opportunity to do, and they see the dangers that are represented before them and still stay active. That\u2019s what really drives me as well. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Think about your hardest day of BUD/S, or your most challenging thing. What was that?\r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, one day that really sticks out in my mind.  I struggled with the O-course when I first got here. I was trying to muscle my way through, I wasn't trying to use any finesse, or use the way it\u2019s supposed to be done. Which is, you know, you just can\u2019t muscle through the O-course. You have to find ways to navigate the technique to get yourself through and become more efficient. And, uh, I was really slow on it and I remember I thought I had passed, and thought I had finally gotten my marker, and I remember being told that I failed by 3 seconds. My instructor gave me a hard time about it, and then went right to logs. Logs was one of my least favorite evolutions that we did in the first phase and uhm, we uh, it was a real kick in the gut, but it was one of those moments where, I prayed heavily in that moment and had to realize that there was still a job to be done. I still had to support my buddies on the log. And, that was definitely a hard moment.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you feel like the group supported you in that time?\r\n\r\n#133: I think it\u2019s not so much about whether they...I don\u2019t know if everybody knew whether or not I had failed or not. It was more just, we all needed each other. The log, the log sucks, and it isn\u2019t gonna move itself. I had a role to play and, uhm, I needed to do it to the best of my abilities. If I was slightly out of it, I would have been a detriment to them, and that would have been bad. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then what, what practices did you use to push you through things? Like spiritual, mental, physical?\r\n\r\n#133: Sometimes I would try to break up certain things that you know, use markers for my goal. Whatever I found, you know, if it was a distance we had to go, OK, kinda found a way to break it up a little bit. If not, if I wasn\u2019t using the markers, just realizing whether they were making us do 12 count body builders, I knew there was gonna be a next thing. Like they\u2019re not just gonna do that one thing for forever. So, you just kinda had to realize this is temporary.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then you said, about prayer?\r\n\r\n#133: Prayer, 100% yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, did you have, can you think of a difficult decision that you had to make during BUD/S? What went through your mind as you had to make that decision?\r\n\r\n#133: Being, uhm, I\u2019ve been LPO of four different classes, throughout my time at BUD/S, And, uhm, you know, sometimes as an LPO, I can\u2019t exactly remember like a particular moment, but sometimes you have to pass on news to guys that, they don\u2019t want to hear. And I think that\u2019s, I like, everybody wants to be loved.Right, and you don\u2019t want to be hated for stuff you do and say, and sometimes you have to be the bad guy and approach people in uncomfortable situations when they're not doing the right thing. So, yeah those are always difficult moments to have to have those heart to hearts, uhm. Especially when you think they\u2019re a good guy, but maybe they're just getting lax in a certain area, you have to be the bad guy sometimes. And it stinks, but it\u2019s required. You\u2019re not bettering them and you\u2019re not bettering yourself by taking that path, so. It\u2019s tough.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So overall, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S? \r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, I would say a lot of it is not necessarily on me. I would say I've had men around me that have inspired me, and again, you know, added the fact that I have a strong relationship with Jesus, but yeah, I think it\u2019s, like I remember moments when we\u2019re like, under the boat with the guys where they encouraged me when I was in a bad, you know, place. Like during hellweek, I lost 20 pounds and I was in a really bad place physically, and, uhm, my buddies really looked out for me when things were getting, you know, when the body was really taking a physical toll. So, uh, I would say definitely the guys have helped me but I would also just say that preparation to get here, you know making sure I practiced discipline and what not. Sometimes the easy thing is not the right thing, and if you can just give yourself a moment where you do something that makes you uncomfortable it\u2019s gonna feed into the other things that you do in life because you realize that you've done it before and you can get your brain to a place that you can accept this is something that I don\u2019t want to do and I don't\u2019 care to do at all, but it\u2019s what is required and I think that discipline definitely has helped. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you notice anything different in the people that quit? Or those who didn\u2019t make it? Can you describe the differences between you and them?\r\n\r\n#133: Uhm, I would say in some of the guys that I know that did quit, there was either a lack of confidence within themselves. Like, they would ask a lot of questions about evolutions coming up, and stuff like that. Like we all ask questions, and none of us are excited about certain evolutions that would come up, but there was a fear that you could sense, that would bring itself up. Then a lot of guys that, uh quit, would be guys that would go to, or take sick days or stuff like that. Like all the sudden, days when you would have boats, medical, guys would be going to medical and stuff like that and it was almost like it was escaping for them. Not to say that there weren\u2019t some guys that actually had stuff going on, it was just funny how on those days, all the sudden there were a lot more dudes going to medical for whatever reason, and also, uh, guys that were on the front of being the biggest and the baddest, and guys that would do a lot of talk. I remember at prep we had guys that you know, based upon the way they talked about the way they were gonna get after it, it was like \u201cOK, I guess you got this in the bag, man.\u201d And uh, you actually put them in the situation and it\u2019s, uhm, entirely different. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: You\u2019re not the first person to say that. \r\n\r\n#133: It\u2019s a mask.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, I have two more questions for you. How did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n#133: The resilience aspect of it has been incredible. You know your patience for, uhm, inconvenience, really boosts, uh, but I also treasure moments when there is downtime to a whole new extreme. I think that when you're not doing something where you\u2019re utilizing yourself to your full potential, the moments where you have downtime just aren\u2019t as satisfying. When I have a moment just to sit with my wife and talk and just watch TV, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to say I've earned the right to sit down on the couch, it\u2019s like, you don\u2019t feel guilty, like \u201cI worked hard today.\u201d It\u2019s good to kinda just sit and live in the moment. It\u2019s very satisfying.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then lastly, SOCOM is trying to figure out what makes people get through this, you know. What should I have asked you that might have given me a little bit of insight that I didn't ask you. What do you think i should have asked?\r\n\r\n#133: What are your priorities?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: To the student? To the student, to the\u2026\r\n\r\n#133: To, to the student. What are, like, what are the priorities? I think, I think we have a tendency in life to make things idols, and while this is a job that you should work the utmost for, and it should be something that, when, especially things that just don\u2019t hold as much weigh in life, this should be your focus. Like if you wanted to go out with your buddies and stuff like that, but you knew you needed to sit down and study for an upcoming test that you have, like you have to devote that time. But, I\u2019ll tell you my priority list is God, my wife, then everything else. It\u2019s just the way it is. This is definitely the priority as far as what I\u2019m working for, but I, I hold my faith and my God up the highest, and my relationship to my wife is, uhm, a lot of the instructors have said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re no longer in the teams, who do you have?\u201d And my wife is who I have. And we\u2019re hoping we live a long life together, so yeah, my family is going to be there. So that is, uhm, yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s a good thing to ask. \u201cWhat are their priorities?\u201d\r\n\r\n#133: Yeah, priorities, you know, something that\u2019s too...sometimes we have a tendency to place things as idols in our lives, it can end up becoming more of a hindrance than, than anything else. I think that\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Awesome, thank you so much, that was really helpful.\r\n\r\n#133: It was a pleasure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Quinn Barber\r\n\r\nDate: 16AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 555 and 139\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 12:41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Can you tell me, is it Okay if I record you?\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And can you tell me what your numbers are?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh 555 and 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay and then when did you start BUD/S and is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, yes it\u2019s my first BUD/S experience, uh but I started BUD/S in December 2018.

When I was 18, I uh I played football and I brOkaye my leg and I have a, got metal uhm, in my tibia my fibula and they said I would never run again and stuff and I had already planned on trying to do this so that was I guess that was pretty life changing. And then uh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, so how did that experience factor into this, your BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Not really at all, like that was like the first time I think that I really had to like overcome something and do rehab and be extremely disciplined and try an get to an end point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So that was, you were a senior then right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes, so I was trying to play baseball in the next, for the next season.

I don\u2019t know, uh, I would say like I\u2019m pretty type A but I\u2019ve learned to really compartmentalize things pretty well and care about what you need to care about and uh not let your mind wander and think about the, like the bullshit stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm. Okay, so what in your background even led you into becoming a SEAL?  Did you know somebody? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you have a family member?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: My family was in the military but uh my, my dad was, he was in the reserves.  My grandfather was in..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Army? Navy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Army.  And then my grandfather was in the 11th airborne and like they never pressured me or anything, but it was just kinda always there.  And my parents never pressured me to do anything and so when I told them I wanted to do this, they were like Okay. It wasn\u2019t like a huge shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, and then tell me a little bit about your childhood specifically how were you disciplined if you did something wrong you know did your parents spank you, did they give you time out did they take away\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, (Laughs) They weren\u2019t afraid, afraid to discipline me at all but that was my biggest fear disappointing them so it didn\u2019t happen very often but ya know? They did if they needed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And did you move around a lot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No been in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania my entire life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then tell me about your teenage years, were you in any team sports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, so I played football ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: And baseball all through highschool. Uhm, was recruited to play in college, didn\u2019t end up\u2026 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: To do what? Baseball? Football?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah both sports actually.  I ended up playing football like my junior senior year of college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So you skipped, oh cause your, your. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No, I, I uh ended up uh just walking on, I was tired of not playing a sport, and being athletic, being on a team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And what school did you go to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I went to Virginia Military Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Uhm, and then was your teams pretty tight knit.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Teams that you were on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes, the most successful ones always had the most fun on yes, like we were pretty close. Had some of my best friends on those teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And what did you do in the last five years of your life prior to BUD/S? So you went to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, I pretty much went to college and then I uh..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And that, you graduated from VMI?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Mhm, and then I enlisted that summer after and yeah I was uh, I was married, ended up getting divorced while I was through BUD/S, I know that\u2019s probably important in some respects so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, uhm, I would say, so, do you think BUD/S contributed to that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Maybe, yes, probably I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: (laughs) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: There\u2019s a lot of different things.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: But uh, yeah, no, that all happened just during BUD/S so it wasn\u2019t like (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That can\u2019t make it easy. Gosh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Its whatever at this point (laughs). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: But It was quite the ups, ups and downs through the last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, would you consider yourself impulsive like do you have any tattoos..do you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I have tattoos but they weren\u2019t, they were very thoughtful and planned out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: The only thing impulsive maybe I think I\u2019ve ever done was get married before I wanted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: That\u2019s about it (laughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay and then what do you think was the most challenging thing you did at BUD/S and feel like your hardest day and what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, one (unintelligible). Uhm, I would say the first week back in my second class with 37, the one I ended up spending hell week with, like just getting back to the grind of it was probably was just that was just miserable. Just not in a good mood. But just uh, what helped me get through I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know I just.. like I said just don\u2019t think about, honestly I know that\u2019s bad but you just don\u2019t think you just do it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s how? Did you have any practices like mental, physical, spiritual things that helped you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I pray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Talk to yourself? Pray?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, that\u2019s pretty broad stuff.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Just, just whatever\u2019s in the moment helps...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: really. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you have any difficult decisions that you faced, uhm, that you had to struggle with like, uhm, running out classmates or turning in someone who cheated or didn\u2019t do the right thing and what did you have to think about when you made those choices? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, will I be able to trust him. Uhm, running through our house with live ammunition. And do I trust him to make the right decision when no one else is around. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Can you give me an example? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, meaning a time that happened?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh yeah, fairly recently, uh a guy got flown home from the island because he was literally just saying like outlandish things like personal attacks on the instructors and he wouldn\u2019t let it go. And then he was prior enlisted in the marine corps, he uh, he was like (unintelligible) in 2015 and that\u2019s why I wanted to come here. And that\u2019s why you want to get a job?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Just weird. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I had no, no qualms about turning in someone like that.  Not turning in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: But speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for, stuff like that cause that\u2019s hard cause you know you\u2019re making an impact on them. Uhm, why do you think you were successful in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, when you fail as much as I have in the last thing, uhm, pretty used to rebounding and uh experienced a lot of setbacks in college years so it's just like I\u2019m going to get through this and I just, need to figure out how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That is a great attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: It's always like a puzzle, so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, so this is kind of asking the same question in a different way, did you notice anything different about all the people who didn\u2019t make it? Like what made them so they failed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I don\u2019t know, they make excuses a lot.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, they tried to rationalize certain things and decisions they\u2019ve made. And they claim things other like other factors that are not themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So, that\u2019s about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What do you think, how did this experience of BUD/S change you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Sure a lot of people say that it has humbled them and it definitely has humbled me but I also have learned that I can't do it without my family or my friends or I, can't do it without those guys and uh I also learned like through the ups and downs you really have to know who you are as a person. And you have to have things to fall back on, concrete things that you know about yourself and ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow, that\u2019s pretty deep. So can you give me an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, I know that I have to go to the gym at least three times a week or run 3 to 4 times a week to keep my mental sanity something like that. I have to read a book every three weeks. Three to four weeks. Or have to spend a certain amount of time outside. Solitude. Have to talk to my family, certain time, at least once every other day, stuff like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s good to know about yourself though. That\u2019s awesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Kinda, kinda forced into it. Why aren\u2019t you being successful, you gotta figure it out so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, so the Navy has asked us to do this to figure out before people come to BUD/S what makes them successful. So we\u2019re kinda throwing a wide net, is there anything else that you can think of I should\u2019ve asked you? That might be the key to what makes people successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, that\u2019s a good question and I definitely have an answer, but I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Uhm, ask, I would ask about hobbies. Because there\u2019s, uhm, a lot of people that read, there\u2019s a lot of people that don\u2019t, and there\u2019s probably nothing that is similar between anybody maybe some things that are similar between guys like what they do in their free time but I'm willing to bet that is just a plethora of different things that is just all over the place. Yes we are all the same in some aspects but not ... I don\u2019t know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, that\u2019s good. Nobody\u2019s said that yet so that is, that is a good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: People always say like it's common men with an uncommon desire to succeed, and I heard someone say no it's uncommon people working in a common space, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Hm, interesting, thank you so much.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 03 March 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 140\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Deirdre Dixon\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, I\u2019m gonna, is it OK if I record this? \r\n\r\n#140: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And, what's your number?\r\n\r\n#140: 140.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: 140. Thanks. So we\u2019re gonna start with something easy. Just tell me how many siblings you have and where you are in the birth order?\r\n\r\n#140: I\u2019m the oldest, uhm, I had an older brother, actually, he died when I was super young from cancer. I have a younger brother and younger sister.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, if you think about your life experiences, what might you describe as your crucible, or really life changing even that happened in your life before getting here? \r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019d probably have to think on that for a minute.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Uhm, how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S? You made it, a lot of people didn\u2019t. What about you has made you successful?\r\n\r\n#140: Actually I did have a, my wife and I separated, when, like right before I went back in the class. And that definitely played a huge part in me just getting after it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So when you say you separated, are you divorced?\r\n\r\n#140: I'm not divorced, we\u2019re just separated, trying to work things out.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So did that experience\u2026\r\n\r\n#140: I think that would probably be the crucible that helped a big\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So how did that help or impact your experience here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, because it went from having a family in the skull, to having nothing but the skull. So I had to make it. I had to make it through. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So what about, your personality? What made you successful as far as your personality goes? \r\n\r\n#140: Growing up, I always got in the ocean, no matter what. Uhm, did that restart?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No it\u2019s OK.\r\n\r\n#140: Yeah, I always got in the water everyday no matter what. No matter how cold it was. Even though this makes me very cold, I really didn\u2019t like getting in the water when it came to BUD/S. I still get in the water all the time, surfing, and diving, and all that stuff. Uh, I was really comfortable underwater. There were people who came here who were recreational divers, I was one, but I don\u2019t think that really made a difference. It depends individual to individual. Im just really comfortable underwater. I\u2019ve done a lot of long distance events, like ironmans and stuff, and I just think that like continuous physical output plays a big part because you go for like hours and hours and hours, very similar to this.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So\u2026\r\n\r\n#140: Obviously not on this level, but very similar.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, let me go back to what made you first want to be a SEAL.\r\n\r\n#140: Uh, my dad was a Green Beret. Uh, enlisted and then he put in a package to come to BUD/S as an officer. At the same time he submitted for the Army\u2019s warant officer program, got selected for that first, so he just chose that. Then he always told me he regretted it. But, growing up, I wanted to be a ranger, I don\u2019t know why, it was just what was always in my head. Then I started looking at SEALs and changed my mind in highschool, and here I am.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Tell me about growing up? How were you disciplined as a child, like what did your parents do if you did something wrong? Did they spank you, did they do timeouts?\r\n\r\n#140: Growing up, they spanked me and stuff like that. Toward like high school, I started to have really bad relationship with my father so we had altercations and stuff, but that\u2019s uh, I think that played a part, I guess... \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. \r\n\r\n#140: At making me resilient. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, tell me about your teenage years? Did you move around, did you play sports?\r\n\r\n#140: Yes, so I was all over the place. I wrestled, played football, track, soccer one year, uhm I did my last two years of high school in Italy. We played other..\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Where in Italy?\r\n\r\n#140: Uh, Vincenza.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, I was in Livorno.\r\n\r\n#140: Oh yeah?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, right, I loved it too, it was really team oriented. \r\n\r\n#140: Yeah, I loved it. Small schools, so you played against other American schools. It was great. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now what about the last five years of your life prior to BUD/S? Did you go straight from high school, then bootcamp?\r\n\r\n#140: No, so I tried to come into the Navy, I knew this was going to be an issue before coming into the Navy. My eyesight was way beyond what it needed to be. I think the minimum was 20/70, and I had 20/400. So, I came into the Navy as a corpsman. It\u2019s a very difficult pathway to get here when already being in the fleet. Super selective. It sucked. I came in, literally miracles lined up in timelines to where I could get here. Got eye surgery, and then submitted all my paperwork and get here. Pretty short story, I guess.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, that\u2019s helpful. Would you consider yourself impulsive? Like, do you have tattoos? Do you binge drink?\r\n\r\n#140: I drink. I like drinking. Uhm, I would consider myself a beer connoisseur, because I love beer *laughs*. Uhm, not to like professional level, obviously, but I like trying new beers. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about impulsiveness?\r\n\r\n#140: Uh, I don\u2019t have any tattoos, yet. Uh, I will maybe this weekend. Not impulsive considering making stupid decisions. No.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at.\r\n\r\n#140: Impulsive considering like, \u201chey lets go to the beach for no reason.\u201d Yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, what motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, at work? For coming to work and\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: You made it through and a lot of people didn\u2019t. What keeps you going?\r\n\r\n#140: I think a big part is people, people who used to tell me I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it through, and just coming here and proving them wrong.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK.\r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, other than that, I have my family, I can\u2019t let them down. And the biggest, I think, I\u2019m not gonna let myself down. I have to do it regardless.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And what was the most challenging component that you had? Think about your hardest day at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, so, honestly with all the situation with my wife back then, there wasn\u2019t, like hellweek did not affect me nearly as much as it did most people. I don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have a time in hellweek where I was like \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d It was just putting my body through the meat grinder. But uhm, something recently was the gas. The gas, they have a brutal CS gassing session on the island that is just, exponential levels and just like the little baby gas chamber *undecipherable*. It\u2019s just awful. Like guys run away, guys, it\u2019s crazy.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what motivated you to get through these things?\r\n\r\n#140: Through that? Oh, I just knew I just had to do it. It\u2019s short and it\u2019s extremely painful, but it's short. Uhm, it's definitely the most painful thing in my mind that I've done. Hellweek sucks yeah, and it takes a long time. But, I guess pain for time, it's just insane. I mean pain as in pain to a time as in how long it takes. It\u2019s like 60 seconds, but it\u2019s just excruciating. I can\u2019t even describe it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, did you feel like you were supported by the group during these tough times?\r\n\r\n#140: Yeah, you make friends and one of the big things that helped me I guess was my instructors told me once, \u201cHey if you focus more on helping your buddies out, you won't\u2019 focus on yourself, and you won\u2019t think about quitting.\u201d Or, something along those lines. So I tried to look after my buddies as much as I could, but uhm, and that definitely helped. It helped with team cohesion. Because you know youre all in this together, you all have this goal, and you all tell each other you\u2019re gonna make it through, and all of my close friends made it through hellweek. And some of them didn\u2019t make it through the test gates later on and got dropped. But if you find a really good tight knit group of guys then...it definitely helps.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what practices did you utilize to help you push through the challenges? Like did you do mental things, or spiritual things, or\u2026?\r\n\r\n#140: Uhm, just like before I\u2019d go out and, I never really had anything. I wouldn\u2019t pray, I didn\u2019t do any ritual or anything, I kinda just like sent it with the boys. That\u2019s pretty much it. We just fire each other up, I guess. Before, during, after, just thinking about it weeks ahead, weeks after, it still gets us fired up. I don't know, just being in it with my friends. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Did you have any difficult decisions while you were in BUD/S training? And what went through your mind when you had to make decisions?\r\n\r\n#140: Difficult decisions? Just concerning anything? \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yes. Some people said they didn\u2019t have any. But you know, if you had something that you had to do\u2026?\r\n\r\n#140: I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think so, honestly.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So why were you successful at completing BUD/S? What made you different from the people that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n#140: In the beginning?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: The whole thing.\r\n\r\n#140: Well, once I feel like once you get through OC8 and the gas and all the post first phase test gates, I feel like once you get past OC8 or something like that, there\u2019s no one thing that\u2019s gonna keep you from quitting, I guess. Or there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s gonna make you quit. Because hellweek is so long and just exhausting that\u2026Could you repeat that question again? I kinda veered off on that one.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. So what did you have that others did not have?\r\n\r\n#140: I think the whole situation with my wife in the beginning was like an absolute crazy motivator. I mean we\u2019re still together, figuring things out, but that was like, if I didn\u2019t make it through then I would have nothing. Especially since this is a goal that I\u2019ve had since I was so young, and it took me so long to get here.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, what about people who didn\u2019t make it? Do you think\u2026\r\n\r\n#140: I don\u2019t know. They might not have had that motivator back in their mind. Or, they just lost focus. They get too caught up in the moment. Because pain will always stop. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK, we\u2019re almost finished, two more questions. So how did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n#140: This experience definitely made me realize that things can get really, really awful, but your mental attitude towards it plays a huge part. BUD/S is absolutely physical. Whereas, a lot of people say these special operations programs are 80% mental and 20% physical. I would think, BUD/S is 100% physical and 100% mental. It\u2019s unlike anything else. It\u2019s, just your attitude to anything will affect your performance.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, my last question: what should I have asked you that I didn\u2019t ask you? What do you think is important for SOCOM to know about trying to select people for BUD/S? What will make them successful?\r\n\r\n#140: Not all the guys that are absolute physical studs are good guys. You need to find a guy who\u2019s a good performer and a good dude, I guess. Someone who\u2019s a teammate.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So a good performer and a good person?\r\n\r\n#140: Yes. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s great.\r\n\r\n#140: Not just a...\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Not just a physical stud.\r\n\r\n#140: And, I think they do a good job weeding those people out. For the most part, or identifying them in some manner.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s awesome, thank you so much.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Nico Sbrocco\r\n\r\nDate: 20 April 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 143\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Deirdre Dixon\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I\u2019m gonna need your number and your consent to record.\r\n\r\n#143: Yes. 143 is my number and you can record.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: 143. Great, awesome.I\u2019m just gonna start with some easy questions. How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n#143: Uh, two siblings, older sister and younger brother. We\u2019re all pretty much separated by two years.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, when you think of your life experience what one would think would you describe as your crucible of life shaping experience that you\u2019ve had?\r\n\r\n#143: Uhm, so I was actually in a previous class here, in 321, and I\u2019m now in 338. I didn\u2019t quit, but I had a liberty violation. I got in trouble on the last day of...If you're familiar with the pipeline at all, it\u2019s the very end before you come out here. And, yeah I got dropped with a couple of my buddies, and I had to go to the fleet for two and a half, three years. So that was pretty, especially with this career, life shaping I\u2019d say.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, I would say so too. So how did that factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#143: This time around?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n#143: Uhm, you can\u2019t really mimic or create in your own  mind, uh that whole, uh experience that I had being in the fleet. I didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. It\u2019s not anything I ever wanted to do, and it\u2019s really hard to get back at all. So, I think in the back of my mind that was always there. I think I would have made it the first time through to be honest with you. But, definitely this time around I had a respect for what the alternative is if you don\u2019t make it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. I would agree with that. So do you think your personality contributed to your successful progression through that?\r\n\r\n#143: I think so. I think so. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: In what way?\r\n\r\n#143: I think I'm  generally a pretty easy going guy. And, I think, like a lot of people here we find a lot of humor in the bad stuff, uhm the hard stuff, uh, when its time to you know buckle up and do it we all get it done, you know, buckle up and work hard but, I think we all have that kind of sick sense of humor, almost. I think it's pretty helpful making it through a long grueling pipeline, like this.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: There is. I would agree. OK, so then, describe your background that led you to becoming part of the seal community?\r\n\r\n#143: Sure, well hopefully, but yeah. So I'm 28 years old. I come from a good family. Upper middle class. Uh, we, I grew up in Richmond, VA, mainly, but I had moved all over before. My parents, uh, both, uh, they met at Princeton. I\u2019m sure it will come up. All five of the people in my immediate family went to Princeton. Uh, so they met there, had really successful New York jobs, quit, traveled the world and then kinda settled down after that. And then, growing up, we also traveled to Paris, and Abu Dhabi, and abroad when I was really young, those are my first memories. Uhm, but grew up in Richmond mainly, and now my family lives right outside DC. And, uh, basically what I\u2019m saying is none of that would have shaped me to be a SEAL, but maybe, 28, I\u2019m old enough to remember exactly where I was when 9/11 happened. I\u2019m probably one of the few guys in this class that even remembers that. My parents knew people that were there, and my mom would have been working in the World Trade Center if she stayed in New York. So little things like that, uhm, not little things like that. But, that was a huge, I guess catalyst, that had me thinking about it from a very young age. I played sports. I played sports in college. So being a part of a team was always a big thing.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What kind of sports?\r\n\r\n#143: I played lacrosse. But, I played every sport imaginable growing up. In high school, I played football and basketball, as well. Uhm, so I loved that. I really, really enjoyed that.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what did you enjoy about that?\r\n\r\n#143: Uhm, so growing up, I was always the best at the sports. Which was great. Then you get to college and Princeton lacrosse is routinely top 10, top 20 in the country. I got there and was not as good as I was relative to when I was in high school. And, so you really kind of learn how to be a very good teammate, I think. And I think I really didn\u2019t even learn it until my senior year. When you get to the point where you\u2019re more happy to see your teammates succeed than you succeed, which you know, everyone kinda says that. And, I said that when I was in high school, college eve, but I remember distinctly getting to that point where I was just so happy that this guy, who essentially was taking my spot, I was just really happy, that he was succeeding. And I think that brotherhood, if you will, is really only replicated in the military, especially kinda in the elite military but I think that that really steered me towards SEALs. Even over any other branch or unit. Uhm, I was looking for that and I think I definitely found it so I'm really happy.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your childhood, how were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\n#143: My parents were very strict, but not in a like I loved them the whole time. I was never fearful of my parents.They were the best parents I think you could have, I had an awesome childhood. Uh, a lot of you know, fun vacations and I mean they were great.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: If you did something wrong, what did they do? Did they spank you? Timeout?\r\n\r\n#143: Maybe a timeout? I don't know, and this sounds bad, because I definitely don\u2019t think I'm this way now, but it was the most well behaved kid you could imagine. The school I went to, you had a dress code, you had to wear a collared shirt, tuck your shirt in, \u201cyes ma\u2019am, yes sir\u201d kinda thing, cute little Southern Virginia boy. And I was that, so I mean I never wanted to make them get to that point, but if they did, you know, you could tell I just, maybe, we were never grounded or anything like that. There was never any incentive to, like, get A\u2019s or anything like that. Couldn't watch TV during the week. We had family sit down dinners during the week every night. And you know, I think my parents both *undecipherable* those were two really important things. We were really close in the family. Um, my mom would go like come home from school and like they let me play first and instead of doing homework right away. My mom would throw the football with me and my dad would come home late and we would play, um I had a great childhood. Which, yeah. I don't know if there is anything there that necessarily.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Not looking for anything in particular. \r\n\r\n#143: Exactly, yeah. But no, none of those like horror stories that I ...\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, no, I am not saying\u2026 What have the last five years of your life looked like prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#143: Um, so, right after college, I was actually a sixth grade history teacher, um which I loved. Uh, and it wasn't like I was a substitute teacher or an assistant, I was, this was \u2026 sorry I don\u2019t know if I am allowed to say that, but yeah, so I was a history buff and I taught 91 kids at private school in Atlanta, 5 classes about 20 kids in each class and uh I taught um uh I guess we start with pre-history all the way up to medieval times, Rome, Egypt, Greece, all that, very basic stuff, but I had a blast. Uh, I had the same kind of maturity level back then. I coached three sports three seasons. Um so, I loved it, but kind of like I said before this was always calling. Um, I had surgery my senior year of college on my hip, so I didn\u2019t really, I wasn't physically ready to enter right away and I didn't really want to go straight in, um so teaching for a year was awesome. I do wish I had probably done two or three retrospect after I ended up getting kicked out, you know, for\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. \r\n\r\n#143: Then going into the Navy. But uh, so that's what I, I did that, then spent probably 6 months getting in shape and preparing to come into the Navy and then I\u2019ve been in the Navy since March 2016, so coming up on almost 4 years. So, I was uh, a corpsman based out in Norfolk. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. What motivates you on a daily basis to keep going? \r\n\r\n#143: Um, I mean it\u2019s not like every day I wake up I\u2019m like \u201chooyah\u201d to get going, but when you talk about what motivates me each day, um, well I am married too, and my wife, she\u2019s in grad school, she\u2019s very disciplined in everything she does, much like better than I ever was, so you know, she\u2019ll come home and immediately start studying and we\u2019ve got a dog and she takes him and feeds him and all that stuff, um where as you know I come home from this and I just want to watch netflix and relax. But uh, she definitely, it\u2019s definitely an inspiration to keep going and my parents are both very successful, not, you know, workaholic type people, but they just, you know, are always wanting to kind of do something. So, I think maybe that good type of pressure from my family\u2026 \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What did your family say when you, you know, you graduated from Princeton, and you were a history\u2026\r\n\r\n#143: When I initially told my mom, she cried *laughs*. Her dad was actually in the Navy as well. And her grandfather was 4 star admiral in the Navy, um, and her dad was at Pearl harbor when it was bombed, so there is some history there. But, by no means was I raised in a military type family. They have always been very supportive of anything I wanted to do. There has never been, almost to a fault, almost, never pressuring one direction, like \u201chey I am doing this, what do you think,\u201d kind of like \u201cwhatever you want to do\u201d like, you know when I was choosing schools, I really didn't want to choose Princeton because it was expected and everyone did that. They never steered me in any way there, same with my sister and my brother. They all kind of do their own things, like \u201calright, that\u2019s kind of the route that works best for all of us.\u201d So, it has been pretty cool and I hope at least when I am a parent to be like that. I dont want to ever force anything on my kids. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Sure. \r\n\r\n#143: So, yeah. enlisted versus officer, yeah. I am enlisted too. So, kind of explaining that once again there was never a \u201cyou should be an officer\u201d or \u201cyou shouldn't be in the military.\u201d \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you think about that, being an officer versus being enlisted\r\n\r\n#143: I mean, maybe initially, a little bit. Once I kind of, learned more, you know, I know some people and once I learned more of what the job entails, I do want to be the guy, the one that is doing a little bit more, uh, that I think is more in line with the enlisted route than the officer route. I don't know how familiar you might be, you know, I might even be\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Twenty-two years in the army, but, I don\u2019t know much about Navy, so \r\n\r\n#143: It is probably fairly similar, but you know, the officer, you get a couple deployments, some action I guess, and then after that it is more administrative, but uh\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I agree with that. \r\n\r\n#143: So, that is the way it was kind of pitched to me. The other way appealed to me, especially because I figured if I really wanted to, I could always go to OCS hopefully. It\u2019s honestly not even something I have thought about to this point. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, going back to BUDS what was the most challenging thing to you, like think about your hardest day at BUDS and what, what was that most challenging thing you had to do? \r\n\r\n#143: Um, the hardest part was roll, I was in 337 initially, but I was rolled for OC8 which is our pool comp. Uh, so, the scuba test where they are tying your hose behind your back and you can\u2019t breathe all that craziness, and that was the first time where I was like, at least in um, the first phase, everything that is hard physically, is like \u201cokay this sucks, but I can do this.\u201d With that one, you can\u2019t really grind out, you really have to slow down and focus, um, so that was kind of the gut check for me saying, OK, it\u2019s not like, you know, plenty people are tough enough but you really have to focus when you are under stress I think. And in that respect, ithink that test is pretty awful and I was able to practice it, which I was really proud of, I practiced it for two months with all the other rollbacks, which was a bunch of\u2026 practiced for two months, we got really good at it. You know crushed it on the next time through, which was probably the proudest I have been through this whole process. You know, it feels good to feel like you crushed something that previously seemed insurmountable. Uh, so that was fun. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Good, and then, what motivated you to push through that event and did you feel like your classmates helped you, like were you supported by them? \r\n\r\n#143: Definitely, like\u2026 this, 338, I am glad you guys are doing the test on 338 because, previously being in 3-7 and then 3-8 and I love the guys in 338. In 3-7, I like them a lot, and thought that you know, OK, \u201cwe are tight, we got this,\u201d and then I got here and I realized what a better class 38 was. So, yeah, there was at the time, at the time I was retaking my last test, they had only known me for a couple weeks, uhm but the rollbacks, you know I\u2019d been with through hellweek and through the first part of uh 3-7\u2019s second phase, uh we all got really close, which was awesome. That was probably the most fun I\u2019ve had, going back into second phase with these guys. So, and then going back to the whole team and not just being a team but being a, literally a brotherhood, and the type of team where you want everyone to succeed so badly, uh, even more than you want yourself to succeed, that I think we all haduh, among that crew, and we all did, all the rollbacks passed, which I think is pretty rare. I don\u2019t know, but all of us, I think there were 16 of us and 16 of us passed the second time and\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Nice.\r\n\r\n#143: And I think that says a lot about our motivation, or yeah, our motivation.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about, what practices did you use to help push through the challenges, like spiritual, mental, physical?\r\n\r\n#143: Yeah, so, um, typically, I guess previously, challenges were like, \u201caw man I didn't make the starting line up, or I didn\u2019t do well on this test, whatever\u201d then coming to something like this where it\u2019s like, alright this is essentially life or death, you know, im either gonna get through this or i'm not gonna get through this. It was the first time I had turned to, you know, I was super, I had never been this stressed out in my life, so I actually, yeah I definitely probably read more, listen to, like, podcasts and actually did some meditation apps, which if you told me I was doing meditation apps before I would have been like \u201cno way,\u201d but I actually did some of those things. And we learned, and it was nothing new to me, but like visualization techniques, and things like that, that I previously never really employed, but I definitely employed this time around. Uhm, definitely employed this time around. Especially with OC8, by the time, my second time around, I was kinda really at peace with what was gonna happen. I was like \u201cI\u2019m as prepared as I was for any test in my life, and it\u2019s gonna happen or it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d And then, that moment when you hit the water and I was like \u201cOK, I got this.\u201d And I think that was the most zen I had been in my life and there have been times that I had that zen moment, but I think, probably all those factors contributed to it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, think of a decision that you had to make during BUD/S. What went through your mind as you made that decision and can you give me an example?\r\n\r\n#143: Uhm, give me a moment. First, I\u2019d say people talk about, \u201cOh did you ever think about quitting?\u201d And the honest answer is no, I never thought about quitting, uhm, as far as the decision, uhm.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Maybe there aren't a lot of decisions that you make in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#143: I think there is. I mean like, as far as like, a \u201ckeep going thing,\u201d or like uh, I mean there was definitely times where, uh. I don\u2019t know. Sorry. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s OK.\r\n\r\n#143: Maybe, can we swing back around?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\n#143: I\u2019ll see if I can think of a good one.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#143: I mean honestly, I think a lot, I think I\u2019d go back to, even though I said it probably didn\u2019t attribute anything, my upbringing. Uhm, uh, just the fact that i've put so much effort into this. Uhm, and I do, I don't think that I'm like a type-A crazy person. But, I am, I am very competitive, and I do definitely kind of put pressure on myself, I guess.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: But you're not a type-A?\r\n\r\n#143: I don\u2019t think I'm a type-A a guy. I usually say I\u2019m not a type-A guy, but I guess I probably don\u2019t\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok.\r\n\r\n#143: Don\u2019t have the right idea of what type-A is. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Nope that\u2019s fine.\r\n\r\n#143: But, no, uhm, you know I just want to, I want to be a SEAL for all the corny reasons. Uhm, but you know I do wanna also, uhm, be a part of this team and be able to have that sense of purpose, too. So I think that does drive you. And on a day to day, I just kinda look at it as any other thing, you know. It\u2019s not like you go to school, you go to school everyday, it\u2019s not like you, I don't know. It\u2019s\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well, let me ask you this, then. What about the people that didn\u2019t make it? What differences did you see with them?\r\n\r\n#143: Uhm, throughout my, both classes, or really all three classes I\u2019ve been in, there have been people that really surprise me. Uh, as far as the ones that really surprise you go, whether those are people that you know I got along with really well, uh, for whatever reason, friends that didn\u2019t make it. Honestly I would probably attribute it to some type of moment of weakness, or, I don\u2019t think that it was necessarily...I wouldn\u2019t label them as a quitter, I wouldn\u2019t say, I wouldn't, I wouldn\u2019t not trust that person with something later on in my life you know if we run into each other it\u2019s not like I think oh he's not gonna follow through on this. But maybe, I don't, know, I don't know, I just never thought that I wasn't gonna make it, and maybe that\u2019s part of it.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. Would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n#143: Uh, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself impulsive\u2026\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Like, do you have tattoos, do you binge drink? \r\n\r\n#143: I don't have tattoos, uh, I like to, I like to be spontaneous, but I dont think it's impulsive, I don't buy things, I don't do anything crazy like that, I'm pretty, you know, fiscally conservative. Uhm, yeah no tattoos, no, uh...\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No? OK.\r\n\r\n#143: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m impulsive, yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: We\u2019re getting down to the wire. We have two more questions. How did this experience change you as a person? Getting through this time?\r\n\r\n#143: Uh, this time\u2019s weird I\u2019d say that, you get pummelled, I think because there was not really, but I definitely, you know when you go home and people say oh that\u2019s incredible what you did, it makes you feel uncomfortable too, uh, say how cool it is. I mean I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good answer.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, yeah.\r\n\r\n#143: But, yeah, I guess maybe, a little, I like to think I was humble before, but hopefully better now. I think that\u2019s what it does to people. You know, you make it through, but you always think of those times when you definitely weren't at your best and youre like \u201coh, wow, I still got a long way to go.\u201d\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OK. And then, my last thing. We\u2019re doing this for SOCOM so they can help us, and really the Navy, figure out, how do we bring in people that are gonna be successful? How do help these people be more successful? What should I have asked you, that I didn\u2019t ask you that maybe would help the next group?\r\n\r\n#143: I guess you kinda asked, or maybe I just rambled on, I think I mentioned a lot, I guess the \u201cwhy?\u201d I guess I mentioned the catalyst and everything, you know, 9/11. And everyone\u2019s got a different one, but I think as long you like, but I think you mentioned that, so. But, yeah, that's always something that maybe, I think people can make one up, but you never really know. I don't know. You could piggyback off other people\u2019s \u201cwhy\u2019s?\u201d in a good way or a bad way, but as long as I think you know what your \u201cwhy\u2019s?\u201d are you\u2019re fine. But, I don't know, I think a big part is just, yeah not wanting to leave these guys, yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, no that\u2019s good. I have to ask something off script. So, when you were in Princeton going through that, did you think about these days?\r\n\r\n#143: Uh, yeah, so I always, I probably decided I wanted to be a SEAL, uh this would be when I read Lone Survivor, which was my senior year of highschool in 2010, oe 2009, and that was when I was like \u201chuh, I wonder..\u201d You know, cause everyones heard about it , but you don\u2019t really know. And then freshman year, there\u2019s kinda been a weird, not weird, it makes sense, I guess, but a pipeline of Princeton lacrosse players that have come through. So when I, my freshman year there, there was a guy who had just graduated and was just starting out, uhm and uh, who actually was the OIC of our next training block, but he just left, so I was bummed that I just missed him. But, there\u2019s been like this kinda pipeline through, uhm, through those guys. So yeah, I definitely thought about it and playing a division one sport where it\u2019s year round, you're getting up everyday, you're doing these workouts with all these guys, and it\u2019s New Jersey, it\u2019s cold mornings, you\u2019re getting up early in the morning and doing these tests. And, a lot of the tests are pretty similar to what we do here. Similar type of athlete, where you need to be fast, you have to run for endurance, you have to be strong. Uhm, so it all kind of, you know, lacrosse is one of those sports where you find a lot of these guys who played in this program. So, so yeah, I definitely thought about what these would be like, what the days would be like, I probably thought about it every day since 2010, and now I finally got to do it. And, it was pretty close to what I expected. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And another thing that I think is interesting is that you\u2019re my third guy, and everyone, this is your second time through. And I thought that you couldn\u2019t come through a second time.\r\n\r\n#143: Oh yeah? So there\u2019s not too many of us. There might be 7 of us, so it\u2019s good that you have a few of them. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n#143: But yeah, I\u2019ve gotten to know those guys a lot too. And you get to know them here and you\u2019re like \u201chow did you not make it through?\u201d So, uhm, yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: No thank you, that\u2019s perfect. \r\n\r\n#143: And, I always remind them I didn\u2019t quit. *laughs*\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Right, right, well, yeah. You learned something. \r\n\r\n#143: Exactly.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Thank you, this was very helpful.\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Connor Knowles\r\n\r\nDate: 26 May 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 145\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Dr. Celeste Raver Luning\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue)\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, so again, I\u2019m recording. Is that okay?\r\n\r\n#145: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: This is participant #145. Now I can ask the questions. So easy questions first, how many siblings do you have? \r\n\r\n#145: Three. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh, what\u2019s the birth order?\r\n\r\n#145: I\u2019m the oldest \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, and then what\u2019s the gender of your siblings?\r\n\r\n#145: Two younger sisters and then one little brother.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Are the sisters..?\r\n\r\n#145: They\u2019re in the middle, yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what do you think were your life experiences. If you think of your life experiences, what might you think of as the crucible or life shaping experiences? \r\n\r\n#145: BUD/S\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Other than BUD/S (spoken around the same time as #145)\r\n\r\n#145: Um, prior to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Prior to that, yeah.\r\n\r\n#145: Uh, so, um, I came from the, I came from the Naval Academy so there are a few things there. Um, there like, there\u2019s some events. Uh, screening (indiscernible) to come to BUD/S that are designed to do that so that was the screening to even get here was probably some of the hardest stuff I had to do in my life, but then growing up, um, playing sports, uh,  like I had a really tough high school soccer coach. Uh, and swimming, um and uh, that was probably my my introduction to physically challenging stuff.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Anything that happened in your childhood kind of formative? \r\n\r\n#145: Sure, uh, my parents divorced  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay \r\n\r\n#145: Um, that was, uh, that was like a different kind of challenge, um   \r\n\r\nInterviewer: And how old were you?\r\n\r\n#145: I was a freshman in high school.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay\r\n\r\n#145: and the three younger siblings sort of like challenged made that more challenging cause I felt like I had to hold it together for them.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, um, how do you think those experiences factored into your experience here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#145: um, being like I said through that through that divorce like I had to lead my siblings through it\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: Um, and then through through BUD/S I was I was a boat crew leader and in charge of a collateral duty and, um, so that that was sort of the just being an older brother was the first time I had to be like a mentor or a leader, I think. Um, so that that you can trace a line straight from that to what I do here and um the physical the physical hardship stuff like I said the sports um were uh how I learned to push through pain and work hard. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: How would you describe your personality and how do you think your personality contributes to getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n#145: Um, I think, I think I try to keep a good sense of humor alway, um, which was probably my best my best tool in terms of resilience. Uh, and it also got me in trouble a  couple of times. Uh \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Here?\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, uh here with instructors. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Just trying to make light of \r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, just pissed pissed instructors off\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: Um, so that\u2019s I think I think that's pretty central. Uh, I think that I\u2019m more comfortable, um, I\u2019m more comfortable when I\u2019m thinking about other people rather than thinking about myself so being being an officer really helped in in that regard because I didn\u2019t really get sucked into my own head ever, like I always had other guys that I could be worrying about, um, which was really good. Uh, and I think I\u2019m a good, I think I have good presence like in a public setting like I think I can speak well and um uh I\u2019m not afraid of having eyes on me.     \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Right, keep going, I\u2019m just jotting this down.\r\n\r\n#145: It\u2019s okay\r\n\r\nInterviewer: so I have a backup. Um, \r\n\r\n#145: So that again that again, it helped with it helped with instructors scrutiny cause everyone gets that and it didn\u2019t it didn\u2019t phase me as much as it phased other people and also like being in a in a leadership role that that felt pretty natural to me.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh, would you consider yourself a calm person?\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, I would. I think so.   \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Have you always been that way? \r\n\r\n#145: No\r\n\r\nInterviewer: When did you kind of switch from not being as calm to being more calm?\r\n\r\n#145: Um, probably pre pretty early like the beginning of middle school, like early high school. Um, yeah I\u2019m told that I was a terrible child.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah \r\n\r\n#145: Like a really like a really bad temper and, um, yeah I just didn\u2019t I had a lot of energy and emotion and didn\u2019t really know how to deal with it. Um, but probably once once I started getting involved in stuff outside of school and my house like I had outlets for that that energy so.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your background made you want to become a part of the Seal Community?\r\n\r\n#145: Uh, so I decided I decided on, the order was the Navy then being an officer then the Seal Community um\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So it was after you got the Academy? \r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, I was, so I was probably leaning towards this when I went in, um, but I was also really intentional about trying to explore every every option and talk to all different kinds of officers and um so I narrowed down what exactly being a leader, being an officer meant to me and then I tried to find the community that aligned best with that and uh it ended up it ended up being the Seals um and then like specifically the I wanted like the best, the really really really high quality people, officer, and enlisted to work with and I wanted like autonomy like I wanted a lot of responsibility as a as a junior officer, as a young guy. Um, and I thought after doing my research over four years in Annapolis this is this is where I found would be the best.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, did you come from a military family? \r\n\r\n#145: No.\r\n\r\nInterviewer:  Now, talk to me a little about your early childhood, so pre-high school. What was that like? \r\n\r\n#145: So, like I like I said I was a uh like really bad as a  young child like a terrible temper, um, destructive. Like my uh, I guess I have bipolar disorder in my family \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: so my my parents took me to a child psychologist\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah \r\n\r\n#145: thinking I had that um and then the story goes that once I got to school, uh, once I had outlets for all that all that energy and had like tests to engage me, uh, I mellowed out a lot and uh I was like I was pretty good at school all the way through like I picked it like I learned quickly and um so I just needed something and um something to direct all that all that energy at.   \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What  about your parents parenting style? What was that like?  \r\n\r\n#145: Um, neither neither of them were really yellers.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: My (pause) probably like my mom was the main disciplinarian like my dad is a pretty gentle guy uh and uh but there was never really like they weren\u2019t stern or uh strict really um \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What was their discipline style: timeouts, taking toys?\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, when I was really little it was spanking. Um, as I as I got older it was enough for them just to like have a serious talk.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: Like let me know if I screwed up like let me know they\u2019re disappointed and that was good enough to, um, get the message across.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about your teenage years? Um, well I guess the other question, did you move around at all during your childhood? \r\n\r\n#145: Yeah (indiscernible)\r\n\r\nInterviewer: (indiscernible) \r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, pretty much\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now what, now tell me a little bit about your teenage years. Did you play team sports? What sports did you play?\r\n\r\n#145: Uh, so I played I played sports like all all year round up until high school. Um, so I played soccer and basketball and baseball and swim team and then\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So that was in high school too?\r\n\r\n#145: So that was up until high school and then high school I dropped I did soccer and swimming in high school. Uh, and then I did theater too. I sung in a choir and did did drama, uh, and musicals. Um, but the thing the dynamic that changed my teenage years was like the divorce, uh, and figuring out how to just figuring out the new normal. That took most of high school for me. There\u2019s a lotta, I really resented my mom and (indiscernible) between her and I when I was in high school and um figuring out how to switch houses like dealing with my siblings and all that so. That would be the defining.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So during that, I mean, did you move houses or were you just splitting your time?\r\n\r\n#145: Yes, yeah, splitting time, yup. And my dad moved like really close to my mom, uh, in the in the same neighborhood. But we were we were all trying to figure out. My  mom was a night shift nurse so at first we were just like moving every couple days\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: um, and then regularly like every week, but that was that was a constant a constant battle.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145:  Yeah, at the beginning of high school. Just trying to figure out what that looked like. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about the last 5 years? I know you said you went to the Naval Academy to here. \r\n\r\n#145: Yes, yup. Um, just uh I found I I I love the Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: I just, uh, feel like I was surrounded by like-minded people all the time like smart, motivated, physically fit. Uh, like most of my best friends are are were my Naval Academy classmates. My fiance is my Naval Academy classmate. Just, uh, I thought that group of people I was with I just synched with really, really well. Um, and it was always, I knew that this was probably the this was going to be really challenging to get picked for even, much less to get through. Um, so the whole time I was going around, talking to all these different members of different communities, uh, but I had it in the back of my head that if if I chose to do something else other than this I would want it to be by choice. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. \r\n\r\n#145:  and and I didn\u2019t want I didn\u2019t want to be like prohibited by my fitness or my grades or whatever. I wanted this to be an option at the end of the day, um, so I trained really hard and and was working with this in mind even when I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent sure that this was where I was going to end up.  \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Do you consider yourself impulsive at all?  \r\n\r\n#145: Yeah.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So can you describe some of the these impulsive behaviors?  \r\n\r\n#145: Yes, um, uh I\u2019m impulsive with money sometimes. I\u2019m not, uh, I\u2019m a bad spender sometimes. Uh, sometimes like, um, once in a while I get like an idea in my head that that like sticks and I work really hard to make it happen even if it wasn\u2019t like a super well thought out move. Um, for example, so uh I\u2019m engaged and my I knew I was going to propose to my fiance, but um I was going to get to see her um like earlier in the night and I had a plan of when I was going to propose to her when she came out here to see me after Hell Week and that was when I was going to do it, but I knew I was going to get to see her before then and I thought so why don\u2019t I just propose then. So it was like three weeks uh and I sorta decided to do that in like five minutes and then I worked I worked for three weeks to to make it all come together. Um, so that sorta impulsiveness. Definitely.          \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about any, um, tattoos or...?\r\n\r\n#145: No \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, any driving violations like speeding tickets that sorta thing?\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, a couple speeding tickets, um, yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Nothing crazy?\r\n\r\n#145: Nothing crazy, no.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n#145: Um, on, during during BUD/S or or just in general?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Just in general.\r\n\r\n#145: So um, the peop the people around me. Both physically around me, like the guys  that I spend my day to day life with and then also my family that I know is thinking about me. I know on a daily basis. They just like I\u2019m motivated by by other people.   \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. \r\n\r\n#145: Um, and then my, uh. I don\u2019t know, my reputation, my own reputation, but then also the reputation of like like the reputation, um, like in in BUD/S Naval Academy guys do well. Um, that\u2019s the reputation that the Naval Academy has established and so I wasn\u2019t going to be the Naval Academy guy that ruined that. Um, that kind of thing.    \r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about, what do you think was the most challenging (indiscernible) BUD/S, whether overall or single day or event?\r\n\r\n#145: Um, I I did I was the, when I felt like I was disliked was really hard for me, uh, by by other students, by instructors, um, whatever. When when I felt like, yeah, going back to the reputation piece. When when I felt like  my reputation, uh, was declining. That was really, really hard for me to deal with and like it came in two: some sometimes I felt like it was deserved, like I underperformed or like I did something wrong or whatever and then I was ashamed or sometimes I felt like it was undeserved and I was being targeted and and that pissed me off. So like even in this scenario, I wasn\u2019t good uh with letting what other people thought about me kind of bounce off.       \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.  \r\n\r\n#145: Like it really got to me. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, um, how were you able to get through that? What motivated you to push through that\u2026?\r\n\r\n#145: Through that?\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Through that kind of experience. \r\n\r\n#145: Um, people around me, uh, who know that. You know, would reassure me. People people who know me well would would you know would talk to me. Um and then the-the sense of humor bit I think like being able to make fun of it -\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: -really helped and laugh with other guys.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Now did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\n#145: Yes\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Your class?\r\n\r\n#145: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Were there any specific practices whether they were physical mental spiritual that you utilized to progress through BUD/s?\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah. Uh, I would - I tried to journal every day at the end of the day uh that was a really good release uh and I tried to be reading something  even if I couldn't get to it every night I would try to like have something that I was working through like a book\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What types of things were you reading? Like were they fun things or were they like-\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah, I read I can tell you the books, I read Man\u2019s Search for Meaning in first phase, by Victor Frankl. Um I read-I was working through a Bill Bryson book about 1927 and that was just likea fun read. Uh I read starship troopers in third phase and then at the end I was working through Legacy. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay\r\n\r\n#145: So non-fiction mostly\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah\r\n\r\n#145: Um just yeah just something to wind down with\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah, interesting. So um, wha-when you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/s , what went through your mind? That could be like an ethical decision, a moral decision...\r\n\r\n#145: Yeah um uh so we uh as officers we found out that a guy this was in first phase after hell week, a class favorite a guy who was like universally well regarded um we found out he cheated on an obstacle course ran around the obstacles. Um and we had this meeting with just the officers um a lot of people had seen him uh other people had failed that obstacle course and were looking to maybe get rolled um in order to- because of it. And guys had come up to officers like what are you going to do about this? This is-this is not right. Um so we ended up and-and we knew this guy had been to BUD/s before like I said he was a leader in the class, he was a class favorite. We knew that if he was turned in he\u2019d be kicked out for his career uh and we uh we came to the decision collectively that he had to turn himself in and that he had to get kicked out of training. Uh and that was - that was really hard for all of us because we thought like theres this reputation at BUD/s where you take care of the guys around you and especially after hell week like thats your crew you're in it as a team at that point and um you know no matter what you've got your guys back um but we had to there was-there was like only one right decision, we couldn\u2019t - because if he had swept it under the rug there were so many guys that saw it, someone would\u2019ve mentioned it, they would\u2019ve found out we all would've been in trouble anyway uh and then we would\u2019ve got kicked out. Uh but then also the it just wouldn't there would've been no way to spin that as the right the right decision to let him cheat his way through an event that other people failed and were facing the repercussions uh you know with honor um so yeah that was that was really tough and it was right at the beginning like we had jus- we were on such a high after finishing hell week um so that was yeah that was tough.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uh, why do you think you were successful at BUD/s? \r\n\r\n#145: Um, the two- the two reasons - I keep going back to this but the two reasons that I came to BUD/s in the first place like the awesome awesome guys and the low level of autonomy like I had no idea what level of autonomy Im gonna have um if I make it the SEAL teams um but the awesome awesome guys just spot on um spot on and the guys around me we were successful as a-as a class because of each other and then also when I took a step back and observed like what was going on around like I realized how lucky I am and how awesome this this community is you know versus others that I could be in um just based on the other guys that were out there trying out with me so\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Um, did you notice anything different about people who made it versus those who didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n#145: Some. I think that the people that are still around just want to be like I really think that the only thing that determines whether you'll make it to the end or not is whether you want to. Um yeah if I could be it into a sentence that\u2019d be it. But then it seems like the guys who- seemed like the guys who took themselves less seriously did better um the guys that talked a big game usually weren\u2019t around after hell week um the guys that were lifting other people up rather than uh y\u2019know pushing others down, that was big one too; being a team player even when it seemed like we were competing the whole time. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: How\u2019d this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n#145: Um, I mean I want to- I want to say that it didn't. Um maybe if -if you revealed a few weakness to me that I didn\u2019t know before I\u2019d be really sensitive to others opinions of me like I think I knew that before but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in a situation before this where there were so many obvious negative opinions um so that so (indiscernible). Again the ability to keep a good sense of humor and not take things too seriously but I like to think I had that before too um yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Great, I\u2019m finished with you. Congratulations. \r\n\r\n#145: Thank you. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Good luck on the next step \r\n\r\n#145: Thanks a lot. Good luck on this uh study. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: It\u2019s great. We appreciate you guys taking (indiscernible).

So first off, some easy ones uh...\r\n\r\nSiblings do you have any siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: I\u2019ve got two older sisters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: two older sisters [4 second pause] and how much older are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: uh one is 13 months and the other is 4 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: and 4 years...older.

Both parents raised you guys? \r\n\r\n147: uh huh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: So what about your um life experiences overall that shaped you like were there any major experiences kind of growing up in your life that really kind of made you who you are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: like big ones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yeah um so I think doing a lot of traveling like church groups um I was able to go to Mexico um on like 9 or 10 different mission trips um just being able to see kind of people at their worst and best all at the same time. Um kind of the worst of conditions uh but still kind of the best of people um was really formative to me and just uh giving -giving people a lot of value as far as that goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: So you did this uh with your family?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Uh a little bit yeah.

Like what are the things that are particular to your personality that you think probably helped you get through buds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um well i'm probably more of like a thinker not really uh a talker as much so just a lot of listening and doing um and I think kind of keeping a cool objective thinking head um rather than um rather than getting emotional I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Good. Now going to your- back to your childhood a little bit more um growing up  how would you say your parents disciplined you like would there be timeouts, they use spankings, they withhold toys. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Yeah so definitely um spankings. My dad had a wooden spoon he would carry around in his back pocket on like the bad days uh so most days you-you just uh kept your head down but uh. There was one-One wooden spoon was worse than the other like it had a chip out of the front of it, so it\u2019d really sting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: One of the wooden spoons? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: mm-hm, you knew-you knew you were in trouble um when he broke that one out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: So would you kind of your parenting style would you say they were pretty strict\u2026.or just average?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Uhh yes and no I would say probably average yeah they still gave us a lot of kind of leeway and uh you know pretty understanding with us. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Um, what about your teenage years, like did you guys move around a lot, were you from a small town, big town. What does that look like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: So, small town uh I was actually homeschooled for like 4th grade and I went to a private school through like 8th grade um and then 8th grade on went to public school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Um so homeschooled up to 4th grade \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: mm-hm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: and then-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Did private school for middle school, yep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: up to like 9th or 8th grade. And then public school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: still a small public school  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Um and what about sports and activities like what'd you do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Yeah so I played baseball and basketball  in highschool um which was a lot of fun. Learned a lot of mental toughness from my highschool basketball coach um he was really big on teaching mindset and um how to go about things uh professionally which was good. Did a lot of bow hunting as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What would you uh, what would you hunt for mostly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Mostly white tail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Okay. [5 second pause] So in your last 5 experiences or last 5 years where would you say what were your experiences in the last 5 years. Did you go highschool boot camp here? Or did you-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n147: So I went to college um got my degree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: So highschool to college. What kind of college was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: So I went to a little school called college of the ozarks actually\r\nThat actually had a big impact \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What was it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147:  College of the ozarks. Actually [unintelligible name]  that you were just talking to, we both went to the same school at the same time. Um, so that had a big part in my development. Just like the work ethic and um you know staying out late and um just working in a kitchen because you have to do pay for school so that was really big\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCDR: So you worked at the kitchen while you were going to school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Yes yeah so its a work college you work for your tuition so you work 15 hours a week on campus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: oh wow okay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: and then two 40 hour work weeks a semesters um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: so what is that, you work how many 15 hours per week?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: per week to pay for tuition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: uh huh so you go to school for free and you just pay for room and board. Its a really good school um it also got a patriotic travel program where um I got to go travel to vietnam with 12 vietnam veters and 12 students yeah so we toured vietnam and heard their stories and its a really cool program We got really close with a man who um was a LRRP - a long range reconnaissance patrol. Um \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Yeah. That is cool and he was on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: He was on the trip so we got to stand in the jungle where he stood and hear his stories just incredibly healing for them and incredibly educational for us. Um so just really moving we stood in the hanoi hilton with two different POWS who were there for six years [dan quinn] idk if you've heard that name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147:  really powerful trip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR:how long was that trip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: 12 days. That was my junior year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Wow that is amazing. How would you consider yourself with impulsiveness like uh do you have tattoos? Um do you um would you consider yourself an impulsive person or not really\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: probably not. More of a saver. Um- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What would you say motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um, I don't know some days it's different um a lot of times it's just the the desire to perform well kind of that desire to be good at whatever it is that I'm doing um also feel strongly that um the Lord has called me to this he's been really good to me and brought me to this point Um a lot of my motivation is the um kind of bring him into this environment with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah. So you'd say your faith is a big part of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147:  Yea for sure.  Big part of that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: what would say was the most challenging component of BUDS like overall areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um so the water I kind of struggled in, being a good ol missouri boy um but um so that's been tough to I guess the water has brought me to a place where I've had to deal with failure um in like a really like you\u2019ve failed kind of way. Um which is which is good it's been good for me um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: so its brought you to a place to deal with failure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: for sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: how so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: well I failed so I failed my first attempt at the CSO tread first phase um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: explain the CSO \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: so its uh its supposed to simulate like the uh rotor wash on the uh like on a helicopter basically you're just in the water full cammies and a charged mask with your entire class so the class is being looped around by a boat crew. It's designed to be chaotic and you just have to stay cool and keep water in your mask and keep your head above water um and think about what you're doing.  [The bee hive]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: oh wait is this um this isn't the beehive is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: It is the beehive yeah its been called the beehive the CSO combat swimmer orientation \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: and so you got rolled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: I got rolled for that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: and you got rolled from what class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: from 336 into 337. [pause] And then I got rolled again for OC8 from 337 to 338\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR:  rolled from 337 to 338 \u2026 for what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: OC8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: OC8 what is that? [open circuit 8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: thats in second phase its open circuit 8 its the one where you go in with twin eighties and they take your air \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah, sharking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: I-I was actually given, during my like boards for being rolled for OC8 I was given a really rare opportunity where I was brought in for my CO board and sat down with commander [interpreted as CMDR Meringues] he said um I'm gonna have to drop you cus its your second water failure, however you know [the CMDR said] I\u2019d like you to come back, okay? So I was dropped from the program, went downstairs, was talking to um the other guys that had boards and they called me back up called me back in and CO said I changed my mind on you based on my gut feeling, I can't really explain it but I think you should stay, so here I am in 338 instead of the fleet. So thats been a huge motivating factor since then to just be um doing the absolute best that I can everyday its like a huge blessing just to just to even be here so I\u2019m super thankful uh that probably should have gone in my [unknown] motivation but um it's definitely motivating to to have seen the other side and be back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah cus they had they dropped you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yeah I was dropped, for about 45 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: oh gosh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnknown: mind if I borrow these paper towels right quick?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah. [pause] Got it. So what...so all the water stuff going ya know, what kind of pushed you through what helped you get through all the water stuff get through all the rolling \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yeah i'm just a lot of prayer um just staying centered on that um-um family being connected with them um kinda their encouragement \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: so you talked to them often?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yeah, for sure \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: how often do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: uh probably like once a week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Were there practices any kind of practice that you would do on a daily basis like almost daily that helped you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: yeah for sure um so once I got rolled for the CSO ya know I went every day to the pool and just charged my mask and went to the bottom charged my mask and swam laps um jst kinda practiced some of  those as best I can [unintelligible] as far as I could. Same thing for OC8 just get as many reps as you can all day every day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: Was there a certain point in BUD/s where you had to make a really difficult decision um that you really struggled with um but you were able to get through? Like is there one thing that stands out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um so there was one instance where like I-I kind of like watched someone skip an obstacle on the o-course and had to like confront that person and say hey like I dont know if like you skipped this obstacle or but thats not cool so that was something that I like really struggled with for a couple days um between me and a couple other students that hadn't seen it I just bounced ideas off of them and had a go about it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: so you struggled with it for a couple days so you didn't confront them right away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: No, no\u2026 um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: So, what made you confront them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um I think just the just the idea that it's a small thing but it's a big thing if you know fail an obstacle and don\u2019t say hey I failed like that it kinda came down to that of like its a small thing it's just an obstacle on the o-course but it's a big thing in that you're not willing to like if you're not willing to say hey I messed this up um ya know what else are you not willing to do?     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah. So why did you struggle with that do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Um, well the main reason was because he um it was kind of-it was a class that I\u2019d just been rolled into. So it was 337, I'd just been rolled into that class. I didn't have a lot of rapport with like other students um and this particular student was also like a kind of a leader in the class he was a fleet returnee he'd been through BUD/s before um so it wasn't as cut and dry as -as just one of my peers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: It didn't feel like it to me at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What were some of the things that you think made you successful- above like all these other guys that quit? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Umm I think early on [first phase] just staying relaxed taking small opportunities to just relax and um kinda take a deep breath and clear the mind and just be like alright I\u2019m here, just relax for example, anytime we were doing something at colors and standing at attention or like running boats, I would just look at the city of San Diego and say, I am here\u2026 alright let's go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What about the guys that didn\u2019t make it?  The ones that are no longer here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147: Well, humm lets see.  A lot of them were really finicky about being cold, or being wet, they would complain a lot- a lot of them were big complainers.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDR: What do you think about this whole experience that you feel like has changed you, like what part of you is different from when you were in BO? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147:  Definitely more humble.  This place has humbled me for sure.  I don\u2019t know anything umm and that has been really really good. um I would say look left, look right at the guys around you, your teammates- to be more focused on what is going on with them- like how they are doing, where they are at, makes it easier on you.  Because you are not focused on what is hurting you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jesse Hall\r\n\r\nDate: 10Feb\r\n\r\nParticipant #220:\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 24:34\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): CDR Ledford\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 220\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo uhh the time is 7:52, it\u2019s 10 February, this is CDR Ledford.

So it\u2019s just the two of you, what about your parents, were your parents married, divorced growing up, what..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mom\u2019s from southern california, she uhh grew up out here in Los Angeles area and then moved to New York for work. She moved to New York for work after completing graduate school in Thunderbird in Arizona, moved to New York was working in banking and then in her early thirties uh she met my father uh my father is from uh all over the place he grew up in Lebanon he grew up in Iraq he grew up in Switzerland, England, um he was attending French boarding schools growing up, but I\u2019d say swiss because that\u2019s where he did his primary school education, middle school education, his sort of coming of coming of age was in Switzerland so I say he\u2019s swiss..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd were they married [unintelligible] growing up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then they\u2019re yeah married my whole life, still are married\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and how was your relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my parents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say it\u2019s the best relationship anyone could have. I tell them everything, tell them my deepest fears my biggest triumphs, I share everything with them umm\u2026 we have a very open relationship, my parents always spoke to me as an adult my whole life no matter what my age was, they never spoke down to me, my dad\u2026 [interruption from instructor] um my dad never picked on me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m giving you too much information,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo no this is perfect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just trying to give you the info down because I know it\u2019s uh do you mind if I pull it just a little closer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the relationship was very open with your parents, that\u2019s perfect. What um life-changing events happened to you prior BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a failed entrepreneur before I came in. I spent about 2 or 3 years starting a proprietary technology company with a few business partners of mine with ranging ages from 55 years old ya know from lawyer to my main business partner where we were 20 years old. Uh we lost over half a million dollars in investment funds, uh well not lost but spent and uh and then as that project was going down and I had to admit that to myself, the SEAL path serendipitously entered my life via friends, conversation with a friend who I was living with at the time in college who went to Norwhich, which was a military academy in Vermont, and he told me about the SEAL path and that day I wanted to do this and I had go through the process of telling our investors that we were closing down shop. At that same time, I was starting to train for this and it was two years before I showed up. So after college I moved home with those very open parents of mine where I trained for about a year and a half just living in New Jersey training with them, like training literally at the end of every training day my dad would ask me how fast did you run how far did you run and how much weight did you lift, how far did you swim? He was like my accountability guy and I would have conversations with them not just about what I did physically to prepare, but then mentally why I wanted to do this, why I was gonna make it and all that. I had conversations with them literally on a nightly basis for about a year and half and I think that\u2019s what prepared me. But yeah, experiencing failure but at the same time experiencing what amazing things can happen if you do stick with the project for multiple years at a time, how far the evolution can take you, it gave me faith that oh man if you stick this thing out it was good to [unintelligible]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what what things about your personality that contributed to this, about your particular personality?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say first, none of those things are things that I did, these these things are god given gifts that I was born with that I went through. Literally during christmas break I went through a old photo album that my mom made of me with critiques from my summer camp days when I was 8 years old I\u2019d been the same person my whole life, um always one of the most competitive but always willing to help others. This is just what it said this is ya know this is literally what the critique said when I was in summer camp as uh 8, 9, 10 year old. Was one of the most competitive, wanted to win the most but at the same time was willing to help out the kids that weren\u2019t as good, so I think there was a human empathy piece there, um and uh uh I don\u2019t I\u2019m a diligent planner so uh I would I would literally keep notebooks of how I was gonna win capture the flag the next summer umm and then um what other things uhh oh here\u2019s a big one um and I know it\u2019s in your evaluation over there on the survey monkey, but I would say the ability to be vulnerable is huge, so I remember during hell week here, and I\u2019ve been like this my whole life, so even if you\u2019re one of the better competitors or more athletic people, I think it was that ability to be like hey guys I\u2019m like scared right now I\u2019m like jacked up right now, there were some negative thoughts coming into my head and I remember during hell week out here on Monday night I literally turned to my buddies and I was like \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, I think it\u2019s a physiological thing, but my minds racing right now and like I don\u2019t feel like I normally do I feel terrible right now. I\u2019m in a dark place\u201d and just by saying it my buddy turns to me and goes \u201cI\u2019m in the exact same place, I\u2019m in such a dark place\u201d and I just go \u201calright, no problem\u201d and then admitting it getting it out there and then saying screw it I\u2019m gonna attack this next surf hit or this next surf torture evolution, I literally got a surge of energy that took me through the next four days of hell week or whatever, so it was that moment when you look at your buddies and just admit, and be honest with yourself, and I think honesty with oneself is huge. Like I I remember when I first started training I was like I cannot do pullups for some reason my dads a marathon runner I don\u2019t have a very large build or whatever I was like I suck at pullups so I was out there doing pull ups every day for two years or whatever, I had to just do it and I still on a PST there, can still only get like 14 15 pull-ups which is sort of its still auto-qualification number but its on the lower end where as there are other guys where especially [unitelligible] if they did that they woulda been do 25 pullups right so honesty with oneself physically like for example I use to I was in boot camp I was like \u201chey man how fast are your 4 mile timed runs\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? We\u2019re going to BUD/S there\u2019s a test gate every week thats your 4 mile timed run time\u201d I was out on the sand in boots in Bates boots that were a size too big I was getting myself for the worst case scenarios and still hitting the times and having\u2026 I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m super diligent like I don\u2019t log but I was knowing you just ran 28 minutes you just ran 27 minutes like I can tell you what my fastest 4 mile timed run was before I got in the Navy like I still remember the exact time. So and then the the 2 mile ocean swim what\u2019s the fastest you can swim 2 miles I know it\u2019s in the pool it\u2019s not the same as the ocean but how fast can you do it? \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know, you have to know that, like um I don\u2019t know I went out here I did Kokoro camp, the SEALFit, so it was a 50 hour hell week simulation so I knew that I could do it right, they say no one quits after first phase, well I go and do the program out here and I\u2019ll do it for the first two days and 50 hours of it and was 30 people that signed up and 9 people made it and I was just like well okay thats gotta be like some sort of indication of something like I\u2019m not lying to myself I just went and worked out for 2 hours with guys that are literally instructors here still, two of the guys that were, I can\u2019t say their names but, so I was like that\u2019s gotta be some sort of indication, so I think honesty with oneself at every step of the way, going out to laguna I\u2019m like \u201coh wow I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do shooting, got a lot of tactical stuff I need to work on, I can barely use a multi-tool, I don\u2019t know how to change a tire, my dad is a consultant like he never taught me any of these hard hands on skills, so its just being honest with yourself like I suck at things I have to do this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo talking about your dad, did you have any other people in the SEAL community, like SEALs as friends or family, military family members or friends?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was the last person that anyone every thought would be in the military.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo a little bit about your childhood umm with your parents, how would you describe their parenting uhh style, like did they do timeouts, withholding toys, did they spank, did they were they disciplined, pretty relaxed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh so I had two characters, my dad was the hands off guy, and then my mom would hit me, spank me, that was the only way I would listen, and I\u2019m still the same way now, I just get spanked by SEAL instructors. I\u2019m always the one finding myself getting the extra remedial beating at the end of the day because I need something to be beat in or else I don\u2019t remember, so spanking there was no other withholding toys or uh if my mom went like this oh I\u2019m really upset with you, I\u2019m like is that it, ya know I don\u2019t care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh what about your teenage uh childhood teenage years did you guys move around a lot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I lived in the same house in New Jersey my whole life, small home town, played lacrosse, had a bunch of friends, rode bikes to their house, thank you god I had like the best childhood of all time, we traveled the world all over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about your teenage years uh did you play any team sports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo uh I played football, lacrosse, uh football and lacrosse were always my favorite. I was one of those guys where I mean come on once you get into high school at a certain point you say am I about to put on 30 pounds to play linebacker or am I gonna stay at 165 and play lacrosse and play midfield, so I quit football at a certain point and just did lacrosse. Um and then I golfed my whole life a golfer, so I\u2019ve golfed since I was a kid. And uh I\u2019ve skied since I was a little kid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm so walk me through the 5 years leading up to BUD/S, what was life like in those 5 years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the 5 years leading up to BUD/S so I joined the Navy when I was 24, so we\u2019ll start when I was 19 I was at school in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh School?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo no like college, I was in college at the time at the University of South Carolina uhh I joined a fraternity, I was partying, I was drinking, going to football tailgates, just a lot I don\u2019t want to incriminate myself I don\u2019t think you guys care about that type of stuff should I chill out with that stuff or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo it\u2019s fine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so I was partying, I was partying and then I realized what how vacuous of an activity that was, I was like why do I feel like crap about myself, why do I look like a weenie body, um turn the page on that got a job as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long were you at the University of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was there uh so I originally went to Kenyon College in Ohio when I was 18 right after high school and then I was playing lacrosse there and it was a really good liberal arts school so it was where my parents wanted me to go and I was like I can\u2019t do this this is super lame um too small of an environment, too avanguard, a lot of theatre kids I was like\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long were you at Kenyon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne semester at Kenyon college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you went to University of South Carolina?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, umm and I mostly went there because I wanted to play golf down there, I wanted to play club golf so joined the club golf team, was in a fraternity, got a job as a door to door salesmen where I think I experienced my first like failure no a lot of no\u2019s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou were still in school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was still in school, still in school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut how long were you in the University of South Carolina?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire the four years following, I graduated from there yeah. Umm and got a job as a oh sorry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you did one semester at Kenyon College then 4 years, graduated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, in 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2017 and then what happened?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then so my uh so I guess during those 5 years I was a door to door salesmen and then I started working with this company where I uh met my business partner business parter Owen he uhh it was a wild story I could go on for hours about it but I was working I was I was working through my phone and my laptop I was working remotely umm and I was on business development, sales end of things we were raising money, we were creating pitch decks uh business plans, working with our lawyers making sure all of our documentation was squared away and um yep we were fundraising, and um so we did that for my last few years of college to include a semester where I studied in Europe, so I studied in uh Czech Republic my senior year fall and then uh for that last semester because I had to do an extra semester because none of the credits from Kenyon carried over to the state school because um Kenyon classes were [unintelligible] a thing and so so that last before that last semester that summer was when I was living down there by myself and I was like this company\u2019s going nowhere what am I doing and I meet I meet this guy who was like he was like this is what I wanna do and I was like what even is that and he showed me and literally the next day I called my family and I was like alright I had a life change I\u2019m doing this I know you guys don\u2019t believe me but just give it some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this is the summer after you graduated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the summer before my last semester because I had that extra fall because of the fall at Kenyen so it was that summer and that\u2019s when I started training uh I had been running for awhile before that but that was the summer that I started training and then and then after I graduated in December, moved home, really closed up shop with the with the business and then was training full time and then joined the Navy when I was 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how many how many years were there between the University of South Carolina and when you graduated minus and what did you do for the last two years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was all this full time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh so you were training?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI yeah like December I graduated December 2017 which is basically 2018 because it\u2019s December of 2017 and then uhh so from 2018 so basically I trained at home from December to the next December, and then it was April, and that\u2019s when I joined the Navy, so like a year and some change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo basically a semester at Kennedy College and 4 years and University of South Carolina, then you were basically training for BUD/S and then you came here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. And uh its Kenyon K-e-n-y-o-n K-e-n-y-o-n yeah Kenyon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, perfect. Don\u2019t know where this question came from here, so would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh what does what does that word mean? Like to make decisions on a whim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, to make rash decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I would say when I was a kid probably but now uh I would say no I tend to think things through and understand time horizons of what I\u2019m doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI already asked that. I\u2019m very curious to see if it comes up but those are things that we definitely notice in our class. We are really interested to see this question impulsiveness and tattoos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to think of other things that would be impulsive decisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what would you say is the most challenging event at BUD/S, like what was your hardest day or event at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say the hardest thing about BUD/S was the stress of the test gates. So at the beginning of BUD/S it was like man I gotta get up and do these really physical evolutions. Looking back at that, that was really straight forward, and that was like\u2026.[mic moving] so I would say at the beginning of BUD/S I was like I know I\u2019m not gonna quit so I\u2019m gonna get up at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning and I\u2019m gonna do whatever they tell me to do and this is gonna be hard and I\u2019m gonna be ya know putting out but I\u2019d say over the long haul the hardest part was the stress of the test gates, oh I have the SCUBA Diving test gate, I have this next week test gate, I have this shooting test gate. I can\u2019t fail, I can\u2019t fail, and at times at BUD/S like especially when you get to the island, the difference between passing and failing is this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like inches, centimeters, like a trigger pull and your breath control, so I mean I would say it was the stress of the test gates over the long haul that makes BUD/S the hardest thing, it\u2019s like holding your contract in front of your phase the entire time, can\u2019t fail the obstacle course, can\u2019t fail that test, can\u2019t fail that test, you get two shots at it if you don\u2019t hit it you\u2019re.. It\u2019s like that was the hardest part of BUD/S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you to kinda push through that, were you supported by the group, was it..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had no option. I was not ever gonna go to the fleet and that was never an option for me. Uh during boot camp I got a little taste of what the fleet was like and there was no option for me. I mean, my personality and who I am, if you were to coop me up on a ship for months on end, I literally think I\u2019d be a liability so Iuhh that that scared me more than anything I never had an option here so this was it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat challenges do you feel like did you do something on a daily basis, physical mental spiritual, that helped you uh getting through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say that your whatever is stored in your subconscious is gonna show in BUD/S and I would say it\u2019s those days when you\u2019re training at home and you say \u201cDo I dog this right now, or do I go hard? Do I quit the run? Or do I finish the run?\u201d and I will tell you unequivocally that in my entire time training I never quit one time. I never said I was gonna do 100 pull ups and didn\u2019t do 100 pull ups, I never said I was gonna run 5 miles and then said oh ya know what 4\u2019s good enough. I did what I said what I was gonna do, every time and I would say even some of the days I went out there saying and guys do this in the program all the time we say hey man last 4 mile timed run of BUD/S, we\u2019re just gonna take it easy, and then I find myself in dead sprint trying to get a personal record. We just don\u2019t have that in us, we don\u2019t quit, we don\u2019t take the easy way out, and I would say it\u2019s dudes preparation before they get in, are you lying to yourself? Did you actually do the 4 mile timed runs or are you lying to yourself? And what was your 4 mile timed run time? What was it? Tell me right now. And if you don\u2019t have those hard answers and you weren\u2019t honest with yourself, I think that\u2019s what shows when you get here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about difficult decisions that you experienced here at BUD/S um did you have a decision that you particularly struggled with at a certain point, like for example running classmates out or turning them in for cheating\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say that I had any of those problems. We did run people out and I did tell people to quit but they were people that I truly believe didn\u2019t have the gifts to do the job, and again a lot of this stuff is god given, like my buddy back here ENS Rodriguez has more god given ability than probably anyone in the class, and I always ran boat with him over people who I was like they can\u2019t be doing this.. I mean we did run people out but I didn\u2019t find it to be too hard of a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat why do you think, I think I already asked you this already why do you think you\u2019re a successful BUD/S student, but more importantly do you notice anything different about those who made it and didn\u2019t, when you describe the people that didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI never spent too much time focusing on the guys that I didn\u2019t think were going to make it. I think some of them didn\u2019t have the they didn\u2019t have the gifts mentally or physically they just I didn\u2019t think they just probably never had it their whole lives, kinda going out on a limb coming out here, um so I think some guys didn\u2019t have the gifts, and then I think some guys um they just realized that the pipeline itself wasn\u2019t right for them, especially for like officers that quit, I think they just realized that I don\u2019t want to do this type of high stakes work. Honestly I didn\u2019t spend too much time focusing on the guys who were I always looked at the guys who I knew were gonna make it and I hung out with them all the time and I think classes get very cliquey so those who didn\u2019t make it hung out with other dudes that didn\u2019t make it, and the dudes that made it, my buddies like my swim buddy I don\u2019t know if that answers that question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfect. Um, how does this experience change you as a person, ya know like are you different?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say most guys would agree that the biggest change is in your level of humility. I would say this program will humble you. If you think you\u2019re the man comin in, you\u2019re in trouble. Oh and it\u2019s not just like physical abilities and stuff, but it\u2019ll humble you in a sense that we all remember a time when guys said hey I need 3 guys to help me out right now with this very difficult task and my boy goes yeah, we\u2019ve all done it, we\u2019ve all seen ourselves be selfish, we\u2019ve all seen it. You have to stare at it in the face every day so it\u2019s humility not just in the physical stuff but it;s humility just all around, you just gotta get [unintelligible] perfect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, awesome, alright, I think that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got um I really appreciate that was super super helpful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI really hope so, and I can\u2019t wait to see my results back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, thanks a lot\r\n", "Jack Sylvester:\r\n\r\nDate: 16AUG\r\n\r\nParticipant #228: \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 19:59\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I'll ask again. Is it okay if I record? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it is okay to record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you state your participant ID number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nID number 228\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did you start your BUD/S class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh 339, I was here originally yeah. The OG crew. Only 18 of us or something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, can I ask about your family? Are you an only child do you have siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm the youngest of four. I have one older brother and two older sisters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo who...can you tell me birth order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes uh....older sister, six years older, and a brother, four years older, then a sister two years older. So...very organized family. Then me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour parents married, separated, divorced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParents are married, never divorced. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long have they been married?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh...30 years I think this year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow and how is your relationship with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat. yeah ...yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd relationship with your siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah. I mean other than like bickering is we have really...really close family I'd say, immediate family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave there been any life changing events that have happened in your life prior to BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean I ...I guess just going to college and everything like that. [inaudible]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems like you got a 4 year degree?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes...yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was challenging or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhm...yeah. Yeah. I was at the Naval Academy. So \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh you went to the academy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...I mean it was...yeah that was challenging I mean first few years obviously are...weren\u2019t super fun. But you know, that's why I wanted to go there and that's why I enjoyed being there and because it was a little bit of a different challenge than I think I would have had a civilian school. So uh yeah, I'm not sure that I'd be here without it probably wouldn't be here without going there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you thought it was like a crucible experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah I\u2019d say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd any other sort of singular events? Like anyone close to you or an accident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, no, there wasn't, I can't really think of any singular..\r\n\r\nNo major trauma?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, nothing like...too traumatic or anything. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do you  think that the experience at the Academy factored into your experience or success at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Like I said, I'm not even sure if I would have decided to come here...without having gone to the academy first. Just, you know, all I knew about the SEAL teams before college was what you get from pop culture, movies and books and stuff. Which I\u2019ve come to learn doesn't necessarily tell you what the actual careers like, but um, I was able to learn more about that the Academy. I think...I don\u2019t know...that's...it kinda gave me a more indepth for being, or for wanting to be, than for just wanting to have a cool job. So yes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo beyond the Hollywood mystique. Okay, how do you think your personality attributed to your progression through BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, I've just always been\u2026like very competitive obviously and uh...I guess I'm just always...slept better at night knowing I've like just gave my maximum effort on whatever I was doing. Like, uh, I've run long distance my whole life. Uh, I was never good at sports, but I was always just good at...putting out I guess. Like just like working hard to get better at something important. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo work ethic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So yeah...I guess that obviously contributed\u2026.Um yeah...BUD/S just definitely I think it fit my personality very well\u2026. Like I said about the academy, I enjoy like having new challenges every day and BUD/S definitely gives you that so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what led you into SEAL community for service selection. Did you have friends or family or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. I mean I always thought it'd be cool. Like I said to be a SEAL but um...I\u2019d say I had uh older teammates. I was on the Triathlon team at school. Um a lot of them came here what are SEALs now and uh...they kind of taught me more about the...pipeline I guess as they were going through after graduating um keep in touch with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you think they were role models and mentors also?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHelped you prepare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I mean just the team in general definitely helped me prepare cause uh...team has a very competitive like...hard-working culture too. Uh...I guess that's why this ends up being such a common choice for us. But yeah...yeah role models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me about your childhood? So you had this great relationship uh uh four...four kids. How were...describe your parent\u2019s parenting style? So were you spanked as a kid?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, that's\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree range parenting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo...I guess one important factor is I grew up on a dairy farm. It's pretty rural. Uh...but so my dad is a dairy farmer and my mom was a teacher. Um...neither of them...believed in like spanking or anything like that. The only time I think I was spanked was if I did something that was...that was if they thought was like very dangerous. So if I would cross the road without looking both ways, she said they would spank me because they wanted to emphasize something like that. But...no yeah my mom's never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how did they discipline? Did they...like restrict privileges, take away video games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...I really don't remember them doing that very often. Honestly, the one, the one thing that we always have to do as kids is uh like if we were arguing with each other we have to sit on the steps and hold hands until like whatever you were in at it with but um...yeah, I...I don\u2019t like remember getting like grounded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that left an impact. So that's, you remember that. What did that instill in you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...I guess...I don't know, I guess maybe it taught me uh that most arguments you have with other people are pretty, pretty fickle...and uh... It's usually not worth the energy to just let your ego take over to get mad at someone else, and you know cause problems because in the end, you're all just going to be you're all just going to be holding hands on the same playing field, anyway. maybe...maybe that's what it is instilled in me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, uh, did you move around through your childhood or teenage years? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I grew up in the same house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame same dairy farm? Um same school system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah same town and everything. Parents still live there today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me about your teenage years? Did you do team sports or an activity close to the Community like band or theater. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. I did a lot of stuff growing up throughout high school and everything. It's another thing especially about my mom. Cause she knew...being on a dairy farm. We were kind of...like she wanted to make sure we experience more than just...being on a farm and going to school I guess. So we did a lot of clubs growing up. I did um Boy Scouts. 4-H, lots of different sports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of sports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I did...you know...everything growing up and then I really got into cross country and track uh throughout High School. I wrestled for a little.I guess it's probably important um I wrestled but I stopped after my freshman year because I just wasn't enjoying it. Um...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was one year that you did it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did it for three years. Uh so Junior High and first-year high school...and then I got injured so I just made the decision to stop that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you stayed with cross-country and track through graduation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah through graduation.I also, uh, did club cycling. [inaudible] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so in the last five years before starting buds. What did you do? Straight out of the academy? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, so...finished high school in 2015, went straight to the academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo no gap year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive? So do you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, no, I'm not impulsive with life-changing decisions like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeeding tickets, uh purchases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I don't have any speeding tickets...no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n So you said yes originally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause like I don't stop myself from like getting candy at the checkout of a grocery store. Not impulsive in that sense, but no not with life changing decisions like that. It's a uh...I definitely think I think about the long-term quite a lot. Uh\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019re thoughtful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalytical in your decision-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsually, yeah. But then like I said, I also just, I like to do spontaneous things too. But...I feel like I'm pretty good at discerning things that will affect my future and things that yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is a holistic questions so you can think about the hardest day, hardest event. Is there a theme throughout that really\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...well\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome guys are like the water. Some guys are like logs. Some guys are like the runs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...well...I\u2019m trying to think. Well, I'll give like...I'll say diving. I really just didn't like that was that was as the pretty a pretty challenging\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about it that made it so hard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...just the not...There's so many variables like things that could go wrong. I thought... Plus I just like the first dive that I did with uh or first night dive,I guess. I screwed up really bad. So it kind of made me fear for the rest of them that I would you know make the same mistakes. So I think maybe that, maybe that contributed to it. I would just get really nervous. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through that fear?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean just, just like anything here. Like just gotta get over it. Uh...you know get comfortable. It's cliche, but get comfortable being uncomfortable. Yeah, and I, I also knew that the more I...just force myself to like get through the dive and the better more comfortable and confident I would be. Which is true, you know because I was fine with diving by the end. I was just kind of tired of being cold and wet but...but in terms of actually knowing how to dive, I think I got much better by the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that sounds like self talk like an internal\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...position you found. Did you also feel supported by the team with external factors? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah. I mean...I mean, I guess that's another common theme, I think. When everyone else is doing the same thing. It's like well if all my friends can do it, I can do too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolidarity? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, solidarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do you have any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that you use to push through the challenges? So some guys say they have prayer, or meditation, or mantra, or visualization exercise? Some athletes will have a warm up routine that they...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...No, I can't really think of any routine things I do like that. Um...I guess I...I guess I kind of have a mantra that...uh I\u2019m trying to think. I dont know how I word it but... basically like everything like this will end. I guess I say this will end. Because...I've learned I learned pretty quickly I guess in first phase. No matter how bad something sucks. If you're in Surf torture or doing logs or whatever like it's not going to go on forever. You're going to get out of the water and you\u2019ll warm up pretty quick because you'll run, you\u2019ll run around somewhere or you're going to be done with logs and be fine. You\u2019ll go to lunch or whatever [inaudible]. Just got to get through it, everything ends. Like now BUD/S will end. It's all finite, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo think about when you made the decision during training at BUD/S, but what went through your mind as you made that decision and it could be example of a decision that you really struggled with. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA decision during BUD/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah like, running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr deciding to go to medical?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never been to medical. I'll go with running classmates out. It was a long time ago i guess. Trying to freshen that in my mind. Yeah. I mean you kind of under the, under the boats, it gets pretty intense. Kind of let your animal brain take over again. So I think uh that's something you have to think about before an evolution like that starts. Using uh...your human brain. Uh, I knew going into it that the...whole point of BUD/S is like...to be able to support your team like being able to sacrifice your for teammates something to prove that you want to be here. So I wasn't afraid like if I knew there was a guy who...wasn't willing to like...feel a little pain, or sacrifice a little to help the rest of the boat crew that I wasn't didn't really have any problem running him out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you feel like you had this awareness of your animal brain having that take over and you were able to then..sort of suppress it and tap back into that cognitive reasoning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I think so. I mean, I wouldn't say I'm an expert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a super power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, maybe I don't yeah. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. I mean,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just it's called mindfulness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I think about that stuff a lot. Okay, so I'm not yeah, I'm no expert at it. But yeah, I'd say aware of it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. Then why do you think that you were successful completing BUD/S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, I just think...I mean for me there wasn't really any question of whether I'd make it from the very beginning. Uh, to think it's just like...not that I knew it would be challenging but I knew like all my friends have gone through this before and I know they're not superhuman know lots of guys have done [inaudible] superhuman and I knew it like it's not like I had any other back-up plan. So this is just what I was going to do. I don't...I never really I still to this day don't understand why guys make the conscious decision to quit. But... I don't know. For me that was never really like what I was worried about so...I guess, is that a good answer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy next question is then what about those guys that dropped? What is it that they didn't have that they\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I said, I really don't honestly don't understand it because to me like going back to, so that Mantra like I don't like one of my friends quit during surf torture of hell week shaking because it was cold or whatever. But to me, it's like why don't you just put up with ten minutes of shivering like literally for a career that will change...that will be your life for the next 10 years or more. So I guess maybe that\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey don't have that perspective...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, having a broad perspective I guess. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas this experience changed you as a person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, probably. I mean...I mean just the just going through it. You learn about a lot about different weaknesses you have whether like they're specific skills uh...or competencies that, that they try to test here. Like for me I realized I wasn\u2019t great with like the diving at first, like I said...in first phase I went to the third try of life-saving which I wouldn't...wouldn\u2019t have thought to mess something like that up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it exposed your weaknesses to you. Do you feel any more confident? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah, but then it also shows like even though I was anxious about those things at first now I could do them without batting an eye. Like uh...yeah just shows. You're capable of a lot more than you think I think you are. Like I think I was pretty confident before coming here like that kind of stuff. I always like to challenge myself. But...yeah this really solidifies that point that...just you or anyone else can do, stay awake for five days or put up with a lot more pressure than you thought you could so...makes me a lot more confident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think would be any questions we should be asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...no. Seems like a pretty thorough interview. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, great. So I'm going to stop.\r\n", "Jack Sylvester:\r\n\r\nDate: 16AUG\r\n\r\nParticipant #233: \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:23\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it okay if I record?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n okay great. And if you could tell me your participant ID number?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n233\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n awesome. When did you start your BUD/S class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh 339 originally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo youre the OG?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I ask you about your family? Are you an only child? Do you have siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a younger sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're the oldest and then you have \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m the oldest and then a younger sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how much younger is she?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's 20, so she's 3 years younger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd your parents are married, divorced, separated.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re married. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long have they been married? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey've been dating since they were in sixth grade. And I think they have been married 30-something years\u2026.married at 21, both around 58 now. Whatever that is.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then how\u2019s your relationship with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then with your sister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's good, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTalk to them often?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I mean not all the time but milestones from Nicole text my sister every now and then. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then are they\u2019re any life-changing events that happened to you prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing that like really stands out. No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you go to college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did go to college. I went to NC State University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four years you graduated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll four years graduated.Um...yeah really enjoyed it. And then came out here right after. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny, any....we\u2019re just looking for, it could be a positive experience like graduated college and could be, did you do a gap year? A mission year? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t do a gap year or anything, I packed Europe twice by myself. That was a something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo different\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo different times. Yeah. First time was in...high school. After my junior year. I had a neighbor that worked for United, who got me on their fit list. Just went over there by myself. Worked on a farm in Scotland. Found em on Craigs List. Worked in Scotland, made enough money to buy a plane ticket to Germany. And like traveled all over there. And then went again. Um in college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo thats an impeccable experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I guess thats impeccable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, how did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I think mainly, uh, just like independence probably. Um. No, expectations and figuring stuff out on my own. Uh. Never planned out anything when I was traveling on the show up to a country, find a place to sleep, figure out how to get to the bathroom. Yeah. Yeah get out of the train station. Um\u2026.yeah, just...Never really like had like long plans just kind of day to day. And day to day is pretty important to BUID/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere there any disasters? Did you have any traumatic events?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't really get that worked up about stuff maybe would have been traumatic for other people. I mean like that stranded like in Germany one time...missed a train and I had to sleep on like the platform. Yeah stuff like that. Nothing crazy traumatic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression throughout BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m pretty relaxed? Uh uh I don't get too riled up too easily. I think um...Just staying level headed through BUD/S is pretty important for me. Um instructors can get to some people and nothing really ever bothered me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL Community. Did you have any SEALs as family or friends?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo um...growing up I don't know SEALs...I don\u2019t really remember how I like discovered them. But when I was in High School I pretty much knew thats what I wanted to do. Um I wanted to enlist out of High School, but my dad was like no you need to go to college. Cause he was enlisted. Um...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you can\u2019t remember what sparked your original interest but you just always had this High School goal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy parents always said like when I was younger like they like what let me have like toy guns or anything. So I would just make my own and they're eventually just like all right, we'll give in. I was...I always wanted to be an army man. And that just kind of evolved to be discovered this and being like that\u2019s what I want to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n And your dad said why don't you hold off? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I actually came and went to like a commissioning Source. He was enlisted and just he didn't like I was like the first male my family or college. He wanted me to be that guy that that went to college and did that. I guess he wasn't treated very well on the enlisted side so he wanted me to go O. I wanted to enlist and so he made a bet with he was like alright if...you apply for this scholarship, and if you get it you gotta go, if you don\u2019t you can enlist. I got the damn thing. Yeah, I got...did ROTC which in hindsight, I'm very glad that where I'm at now. But\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me a little bit more about your childhood and their parents parenting style. So were you spanked as a kid?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree range parenting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah yeah, I got spanked for sure. My dad was pretty\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there a belt or a paddle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Yeah. Yeah, every time my dad would spank me and then he\u2019d like give me a hug after. It was interesting. Be all scary do the spanking and then after give me a hug and be like its settled, you paid your dues or whatever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you feel like there was a why behind it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah anytime I got spanked it was, definitely a why behind it. Definitely deserved it. I guess...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then as you got older was there  restriction of privileges. Did they take away your video games, your phone, your car?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo well actually grew up with no TV or anything.... So we're um...forced to be outdoors for entertainment. Um. Got like a flip phone in High School. And uh\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo minimal tech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...um...yeah there's really nothing like this taking stuff or whatever. Um they wanted me to be pretty independent once I got into high school. Um. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, and did you move around a lot during childhood or teenagers years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I was born in Anchorage, Alaska and then we when I was five we moved to Virginia and I stayed there until I was out of school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Alaska til 5 and then\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStayed in Virginia, and I went on Texas State. My whole family is from North Carolina and in college my parents moved back to North Carolina. But\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they were close while you were in college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell four, four hours away in Nashville but yeah. It ended up, it ended up being like the same distance. Driving to Virginia compared to where they lived in North Carolina. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I guess we're trying to get at here is did you feel like you were uprooted and moved around in schools and social groups? You felt like there's a pretty consistent pretty consistent\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me about your teenagers years, did you participate in a team sport or an activity with the tight-knit community? So like band or theater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I, I wrestled my whole life...and played football...wrestling is definitely my favorite sport. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in band in Middle School just cause it was required. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what did you do with the last five years prior to BUD/S? So you commissioned right out of ROTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCame straight here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, you didn\u2019t take a gap year or anything after high school? It was high school into college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh school right into college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd would you consider yourself impulse? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh yeah, I guess so. I mean\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean like do you have any tattoos? I don't know\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I've got a tattoo on my ass that I got. Um\u2026it's just like a wolf holding a beer...um not. I told somebody that I would do it when I was drinking and then man of my word so woke up and had to go do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. Like speeding tickets or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNever gotten a speeding ticket. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBig purchases or anything? How do you make your decisions? Do you typically think about them and plan them out now or do research or you just more like go with my gut?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I just, day to day. Um... I was like, yes, I think you guys will like this. I wrote about this for my SOAS application...like as a turning point in my life. Um...I think I was in like 8th grade or ninth grade. And I'd like...I was like pretty like straight arrow in school. I didn't do anything...like crazy, I don't know crazy, but like just walk the line. My dad like brought me one day and was like you need to get in trouble this week at school. Like you need to go to the principal's office and do something. Yeah, I did, and so I did and it was really weird and from then on I just kind of live my life as like not scared to get in trouble kind of thing. And...and its definitely changed the way I do stuff. And he wasn\u2019t like go and do something so bad that like you know...But I knew what he was saying. It...It was cool. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wanted you to push your comfort zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went and like played a prank on a teacher...and I got sent to the principal's office. It was completely harmless and funny but...yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is kind of a holistic question. So it could a particular event, or a certain day, it could be something as broad as water or logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the most difficult part about BUD/S is the first 15 minutes waking up everyday. Other than that nothing is too challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause BUD/S is just such a grind of day to day. Getting up and\u2026having another day of BUD/S I think...that...once you get out of bed, and those first 15 minutes are over...You\u2019re with the boys and...nothing is that bad.  Everything is doable. And then getting up in the morning is the hardest part. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk so what motivated you to get up and...actually get dressed and\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean for me this is what I want to do. And I had to get up and get dressed and do that. And um...just I dont really know. But I know those first 15 minutes in the morning when that alarm is going off is the hardest part. You know its like...here we go. Another day.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo is it like a self talk that you have with yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. yeah definitely. Just like come on we gotta do this. And as like an officer, you gotta be an example. I\u2019d be in the room with a bunch of other guys and they like see that you\u2019re getting up um first one out of bed\u2026.But I think that..that getting up is the hardest part. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do you have any practices physical, mental, or spiritual that you use to push through those challenges? So some guys say they have prayer, or meditation, or mantra, or visualization exercise? Some athletes will have a warm up routine that they do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm... I pray but I don\u2019t pray like every, everyday...but for like big events I\u2019ll send up a prayer. Um I do more like meditation. Just like really...like mental reps. Tons of test gates at BUD/S. And I\u2019ll somehow I\u2019ll just dream about  doing like OC-8 or pool comp or something just over and over.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou call it mental reps?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah just like mental reps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a visualization?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you, were you taught that here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve just always. Anytime its something like that, like a big event coming up...I\u2019d always just do mental reps of whatever it was just over and over in my head just to make sure it was good to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you ever make a difficult decision during training at BUD/S? And what went through your mind with that decision? And can you give me an example of a difficult decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficult decision in BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for example running a classmate out or turning in a cheating classmate or maybe a decision to go to medical. You know and risk getting rolled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately I\u2019ve never ever stepped into medical here. Um, but running guys out of boats...I never really thought that was a [inaudible] decision. Um...that almost comes down to these guys are hurting my boat crew these guys are hurting my boys...you need to leave.  Um...Its always about what\u2019s best for the group. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...I think I just wanted to do it. Every, everyone that I\u2019ve seen...not make it, they didn\u2019t...they didn\u2019t really...you have to just want to be here. No...not get stuck with...the little day to day tasks can eat away at you and just have a sight of the big picture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next question is did you notice anything about those who dropped, who didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. I have, I actually had a workout group at NC State and uh 7 of us have gotten through and pretty good success rate and this last class we had a guy DOR for the first time out of our whole group. And he\u2019s like oh yeah I\u2019ll just got EOD. And like the second you have any other option besides completing this training, you are not going to complete it. So I think that\u2019s\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they allowed themselves to entertain a plan B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight. Whereas for me it's like, yeah theyre are theoretically i guess plan Bs but... they were never really an option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person? Has it changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI dont think that it really has changed me a person. I think that I have like new experiences that maybe provide me different perspective on...other people, I\u2019ve learned a lot about other people just by observing people go through BUD/S but...I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any tougher or any different after going to through BUD/S...I might even be a little bit softer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are the second person to say that. Interesting. Is there anything that we haven\u2019t talked about that you think would be helpful in our search to understand this idea of grit and resilience and hardiness and mindfulness in what would make a successful candidate in the future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...um...I don\u2019t know I think its just...its all mindset. I have seen some guys that are animals like just physically...studs that quit. And then I\u2019ve seen guys that are not, and they make it through with no problem. I think it just literally comes down to your mental attitude and desire to want to be here\u2026.I was never an amazing athlete, um, and then they\u2019re are guys in here that are D1 athletes and they\u2019re guys in here that have never played a sport before. And they all have a similar desire to want to be here. And I think that's what it is.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: SCHATZ\r\n\r\nDate: 19 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 237\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 13:22\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nIt is 0825 on 10 Feb, CDR Ledford and I am uhh with Participant number 237 and uhh are you good with us recording this?  Yes. Okay, so we are just going to talk about some uhh background questions uh some warm up ones Cool for you to get started with.\r\n\r\nUh when did you start with BUD/S?\r\nUhh Class 339. 339.\r\nAnd was this the first time you\u2019ve been to BUD/S?\r\nYes.\r\nfirst time that's good. Uhh siblings, how many siblings do you have?\r\nI have three siblings.\r\nSo whats, how are you in the stack?\r\nI\u2019m the youngest. Of four.\r\nAnd what are their what are their ages? So my and sexes.\r\nSo my sister is the oldest she is 28, uhh my brother Dave 27, umm and my brother Paul 25.\r\nAnd you are?\r\nI\u2019m 23. My sister actually just turned I think 29 while I was gone.\r\n29.\r\nYea no sorry about that.\r\nIts good. Gotcha. Uhh Parents, are your parents married, divorced?\r\nThey\u2019re married.\r\nAlways married?\r\nYup, 25 years.\r\nAnd whats your uh relationship with your parents? Pretty close?\r\nVery close, yes. They live overseas, but we are very close.\r\nWhere do they live?\r\nThey live uh in Qatar in Doha for my dad\u2019s work.\r\nSIO: So uhh looking back at your life, would you say there were any life changing events that occurred that kinda shaped you in some way or somehow, really significant?\r\nMhm, uhh I\u2019d say  probably as a military kid, moving around living in Hawaii and Peru at a young age kinda opened my eyes a little bit and umm I moved to Coronado as a 12 year old and that kinda exposed me to what the SEAL Teams were at a young age. Umm sorry I didn\u2019t give multiple.\r\nSorry what?\r\nSorry I hope thats what you mean.\r\nYea no thats perfect. Yup thats good. What do you think about your personality that contributed to your progression at BUD/S?\r\nUmm I\u2019m super out going. Umm I like to connect with the guys so I think that helped a lot. Umm In first phase, umm you know in physical evolutions I was able to motivate the guys. Umm, also I have a side a competitive side I uh played sports in college and was a captain and stuff so I think that helped me as being O in BUD/S, that translated really well having that experience to lean on you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What about your background that lead you to  becoming a SEAL? Did you have any SEAL friends or family? I did. So my dad was dad in the Marine Corps, dad was military. What\u2019d your dad do in the Corps? So he was a Wizzo or an NFO, uh he was a backseater excuse me for F-18s and then my brother is a PJ and then some of my really good friends growing up dads\u2019 were in the Teams so I think all of those contributed to it. So your friend\u2019s dads were in the Teams. Yea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhh so what about your childhood like how were you disciplined as a child. A, did your parents spank you? Strict. Pulled toys? Yup. Yea my parents were really strict growing up. Christian household spankings all of that. And you moved around a lot as a childhood? Yes. How often? About every three years until uh I was 12. Every 3 threes until 12 and then after 12? After 12, my dad got out and we stayed in San Diego.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Umm your teenage years, did you do uhh team sports or any activity? I played lacrosse, football, soccer with lacrosse being my main sport. Lacrosse, soccer, football.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:What about the last 5 years prior to coming to BUD/S if you could trace out what did you do for those 5 years leading up to BUD/S? Umm so I went to the Merchant Marine Academy in New York. Oh really, how long were you there for? I was there for four years. Oh so you graduated from Kings Point. Yea umm yea within that timeframe I spent a year at sea that was definitely a big growth period, working on ships and then I came almost straight here.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself an impulsive person? I guess depends on the circumstances, but umm yea I\u2019d say yea but it depends on what it is. Do you uh have any tattoos? I do, I have three. Big ones, small ones? Yea uhh pretty small one is maybe a medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What do you think was the most challenging component of BUD/S like what was the hardest day or hardest event? What would you say the hardest piece was? Umm probably hell week, I would say the surf torture on day 1 of Hell Week that was the darkest moment I had besides getting gassed.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you to push through it?\r\nUmm I had a couple buddies Chris Dunn being one of them and we were talking to each other while we were getting surf torture and we we all admitting and relating that we were in a dark place and in that head space and that we were all in it together.\r\n\r\nWhat about umm practices?\r\nDid you have any daily practices uh like physical, mental, spiritual that helped you deal with the challenges.\r\nThe one daily practice that was consistent for me was my morning cup of coffee. I bought a Keurig and I would lock it in my closet everyday and that was my thing I would look forward to every morning was my cup of coffee. Laughs, would you do anything while you were drinking  coffee or? Umm yea I\u2019d put my headphones and I\u2019d listen to music, umm depending on the day sometimes it\u2019d either be hard rock or some mellow reggae. And then umm on the island, I read my bible every night that was my little thing at the end of the day that kinda kept me grounded and that I could look forward to.\r\n\r\nDo you think about any kind of decision you had to make was there a difficult decision that you really struggled with getting through BUD/S?\r\nMhmm so sorta like running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmates, anything you really had to grapple with. Umm no, I haven\u2019t been faced with anything like that yet. I guess one is when we do top five bottom five and being honest if someone is your pal and they are not a good performer do you really think they are bottom five. That was tough for me a couple times. Being honest about that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think made you successful at BUD/S?\r\nMan that\u2019s something I would attribute to a lot of different things I had a really good training buddy at Merchant Marine that went EOD. I had a mentor growing up in Coronado that was a SEAL chief and he was both a spiritual and a physical mentor if you will. Umm college lacrosse and surfing and spear fishing helped me in the water\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about those who didn\u2019t make it? What did you notice about them, what would you say the difference is between guys who are not here?\r\nUhh I think that they had an excuse for things, they came up with an excuse for why things weren\u2019t up to par.\r\n\r\nHow do you think this experience changed you as a person?\r\nUmm I think it shows you the things you are capable of. Anything else. I also think it humbles you if you don\u2019t humble yourself and it will show you what you are not good at and it will expose you whether its your classmates calling you out, an instructor or an evolution you fail. Anything else you think that helped or hurt you that you think we should be asking about? Umm not that I can think of. Awesome, alright thank you that was really helpful. Letme see the (Unintelligible) that we are going to write. Alright, thank you.\r\n", "Jack Sylvester:\r\n\r\nDate: 16AUG\r\n\r\nParticipant #240: \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 18:17\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo I have your permission to record? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. And if you would say your participant ID number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n240.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI started BUD/S...in lets see, I shipped out to boot camp April 1st. I believe BUD/S would have started somewhere early September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was your class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n339. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now you\u2019re in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n339. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you started in 339, and you are in. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah gold original. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OG?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OG. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this your first BUD/S experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, so can we talk about your family, do you have brothers and sisters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. One sister, she is about eighteen months younger than me\u2026.Mother, father. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo just the two of you and your sister. So you are the oldest, are your parents married, separated\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, whole time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah married whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk so so how many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm\u2026.let's see like it's got to be going on 37, 38 now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, a long time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what's your relationship with them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwesome. Yeah. Awesome role models talk to them almost every day. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. And good relationship with your sister? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny life changing events that happened in your life prior BUD/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to BUD/S\u2026.um...aside from just having kind of like the one off relative pass away, which was a grandparent, no, I haven't had anything that, that has been kind of life changing. I would say. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo losing a grandparent was hard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah, it was hard. Yeah, I grew up with them, um...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandfather?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandfather, yeah...uh but no, nothing really was that life changing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's was that traumatic or natural causes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Natural causes yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind of expected, sad but expected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah exactly yup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk...Do you think that those experiences, any experiences that factor in your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm....as far as the life events, no, I don't think so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh school? Junior college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep. I went to high school and then played football in college,um...played local here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say that was probably more just kind of being a lifelong athlete was more, I think, kind of the hinge point for, for coming to BUD/S and, and doing well here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what college did you play football for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the University of San Diego. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that it would be D....?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be D1AA..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefensive end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how do you think your personality contributed to your progression at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you know what I mean when we say personality? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as character traits and\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. so exactly what traits, like introversion, extroversion, consciousness, uh openness, agreeableness, neuroticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...I would say I'm probably a little more introverted. As far as like being outspoken and being kind of like a leader. I\u2019m sort of just like hitting the follow button for BUD/S and...and being coachable.  Just kinda...do what I\u2019m told...you know pass test gates. Um...yeah. Really not trying to do anything like really out of line or anything like that. Sort of...follow the natural progression. Phase to phase. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...sense of humor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think so. Yeah. Yeah, I think yeah I think, I think my friends would say so too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut are you like the jokester in the group or you just\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitely not the jokester. But, but the sense of humor is huge here. Yeah. You definitely need that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community. So do you have any SEAL family, friends? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure, yeah, yeah. Um...so I was first introduced to the SEAL teams in high school. I have a buddy who's currently on a SEAL Team. Um... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend from high school? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend from high school yes. And then uh...went to college...uh played with a SEAL who had walked on our football team after his SEAL career was done. He was around 31, 32. Uh, yeah, it's pretty cool actually. Like ESPN did a whole story on him, so kind of got reintroduced back into the teams that way. And then just being in San Diego, you hear one off instances of like the SEAL teams and what they do and um...graduated from college, worked in accounting for a number of years before eventually deciding to, to join the teams. I sort of just missed that like team environment and the whole brotherhood aspect and meeting like a great group of guys. Like...it's definitely true that like you do this reason for the guys. I would say so. So they kind...overall that\u2019s what led me back to BUD/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk so it does sound like...like some close contact, and then role models and mentors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah...definitely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, so tell me about your childhood. We're looking here for discussion of your parents\u2019 parenting style. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo like were you spanked? Was it free range parenting? Was it like would they take away your video games, car privileges or phone? Yeah, like how to discipline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Uh...so my family, my parents were pretty strict. Um...always went to school, came back, did my homework, check, would check my homework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you remember being spanked?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh yeah. I was yup, i was yup, spanked. I would get the belt sometimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpoon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, no spoon...but um yeah definitely that and I would say was probably equal on both sides, both mom and dad. But yeah strict yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then as you got older\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey've chilled out a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's kind of cool um...but yeah they're definitely way more relaxed and yeah. Just kind of hanging out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you move around throughout your childhood or teenage years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope. Born and raised in same town. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame town?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...Stockton, California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd same house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame school, like you didn\u2019t have to move around schools or anything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your teenage years. You mentioned sports, so that was football through high school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, teenage years I...are mostly characterized, I would say, by sports. Just I would... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny sports besides football?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, football, basketball, track...baseball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these are team sports teams?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam sports yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...so you enjoy not just the actual sport on the field, but the group cohesion? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah. Yeah, all my best friends are...all played sports with me at some point, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you...for the last five years before BUD/S how many years were you in the accounting career?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...last five years. So...I graduated in 15 and then I worked in accounting from 16 to...uh...towards I think like the end of 2017. And then I moved back in with my parents and um trained until shipping out in twenty nineteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then you train for two years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what did that training consist of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...it was mostly running, swimming. So I would wake up, I would go swim in the morning, um... run sort of around midday, and then the late day would have some sort of like stretching or weightlifting session. And I did that for the extent of about the time that I was home. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny...because it sounds so physical, any mental, spiritual exercises that you were doing during that time? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...no...I've never really been one for religion. Uh... mental exercises, no, I never...never really did any like meditation or anything. I think just the only sort of like constant pressure, I guess I would feel is like, you know, hey, you're still living with your parents or like you're living with your parents. You got to, like, start making moves and get out. And so I think that was always kind of like, OK, when am I going to enlist and ship out and do all that? I had always known that I was going to come here, but you just kind of like getting the ball rolling as, as, as far as life progression probably the only really mental thing that I was dealing with. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when you were playing football in college, did you ever work with sports psychologist or anybody who had that mental training, overlayed with your physical training. Did they do visualization exercises? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, they had none of that. Yeah, I think as far as that stuff, it was it was more honed on, like actually just being in sports. I think like personally for me, I know I, I try to do a lot of that stuff subconsciously, but it's like I'm not really thinking about it. But I think we all kind of do that. But as far as training, specific training, no, I've never had that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive? For example do you have any tattoos you got on a whim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. The tattoo question. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't consider myself impulsive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeeding tickets?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny big purchases?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMmm...aside from, like a laptop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr something like that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee a car and buy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. No, no, no. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou tend to be more analytical in your decision making?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah, sure. Definitely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging part of BUD/S? So it could be a particular day, it could be water or logs?.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I think for me it uh would have been second phase, OC-8 test. Because I went\u2026 uh to my third attempt on that. So that was probably the hardest part of BUD/S. Um...and then\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was it that made it so challenging?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it was just I hadn't had the procedures down uh flat and so my first test was kind of rough. The second test went a lot better. Still failed that one. So then the third test, I finally got it. But um...yeah, more procedural based on that one. Um...on the island, just working all day, every day. That was a grind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through that grind and to go back to that OC-8 test the third attempt? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep going?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh...I think I had just like...didn't want to leave my friends. I had come so far. Like, I've invested just a lot of time into this whole this, this whole pipeline. And I think the more I get into it, the more, you know, obviously the more skin that I'm putting in. And so at this point, it's like I'm sort of all in and it just kind of snowballs. You don't...you know, it's just like, why would I quit now? You know? Why would I leave to leave and...leave my buddies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when you say you, leave your friends, you were talking about friends that were here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there any thought of people that weren\u2019t here? Friends or family outside of the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah, I thought about my family a lot. Um...you know, feeling the shame of, like, telling my dad or my mom that like hey I quit or I got rolled or something happened. Um...yeah, that, that definitely weighed on me a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any practices, physical, mental, spiritual, that you used to push through the challenges? So, again, like a prayer or a mantra or a visualization exercise. Some athletes will have a warm up routine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have anything that was\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, nothing like that. I remember, though, for, like specifically the OC-8 test, I would go back to my room and like write down, try to like recollect and rethink like, OK, what did I do that day? What did I do wrong? What do I need to do right? And just sort of like I could see something on paper and go, OK, just try to do that next time and um think about that like during the evolution. And like before OC-8 I was, I was on the pool that just going through kind of like, OK, remember the key points that you wrote down last night? Try to do those. If you do those, you're going to be successful, so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that is like a reflection and visulaization as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? And was there a decision that you really struggled with at BUD/S? fights, for example, running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Um...mmm...I think like at least in like first phase, like the difficult decisions, I would say, are were more of like I don't, I don't want to quit and look like inferior to my buddies. But, like, I don't know...Yes, that's a, that\u2019s a tough question. A difficult decision that I just try I just always try to think of myself like, don't quit. Um...this sucks right now, like you'll push through. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, so that's that's definitely like the decision to quit or not. I think we\u2019re looking for a like a difficult decision relates to a situation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo did you ever consider running a class out or did you ever encounter a classmate cheating or cutting corners that you felt that you confronted, um, like in the evals? Any sort of difficult conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I mean uh....No, I don't think so. I've never had to like...never ran a classmate out. But I mean, as far as, like, the evals, things like I don't think that they were too difficult to me just because, like, they're true. I always try to just be truthful in them. But um, as far as difficult decisions, no I can't really think of anything specifically that, that I had to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think that you were successful at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, I would say that I had a great friend group who were all very motivated that were here for the same reasons. Um...And just trying to impress them and, and make it through the program with them helped me kind of find my inner strength like, oh, if my buddies can do it, I can do it. And um...I just had sort of like this, like, if I'm going to, you know, I put a lot of time into it. And so if I'm going to give this my everything, like there's no way that I'm going to ring the bell or if I get injured, I get injured. But there's no way that I'm going to leave the program voluntarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re all in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, so what was different about those that didn't make it? Those guys that dropped? What did they lack?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...I don't know, it's tough because I don't know if they're like lacked. I mean, I met some really good guys, ended up quitting. I don't know if they, they lacked anything per se. I just think they maybe had thoughts of doing something else. They maybe if they had something, something else going on in their lives, that, they might have just thought this wasn't for them. It's, it's, it\u2019s weird because I like, a lot of the. I think that there a lot better guys than me that quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter in what way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical, mentally stronger. I think in the, in the end, it's just kind of like a decision like do you want to keep going or do you want to do something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA decision? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think so. Definitely \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery humbling pipeline. Uh, it teaches you a lot about yourself in a way that, that I don't think that I would ever figure out. Like...there's always going to be somebody better than you. You can never, you can never not find work. You will always have something to do and you should always be improving. And I learned more in these six months at BUD/S than I did in my entire sports career. It\u2019s like...you're always going to be humbled. There's always something to do. You know, it's just kind of like a microcosm of life itself. It's really interesting talking to my buddies all the time of, like, learn more in these six months I feel like I have almost the entirety of my entire life playing sports for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything that we didn't ask or cover that you think would be relevant to this investigation and?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm...No, I think that comes about, about everything. Yeah can\u2019t really think of anything else.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Dan McDonald\r\n\r\nDate: 16 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 241\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 14:41\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 241\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName and do you mind if I record?\r\n\r\nSure uh \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean not your name uh sorry, your number hahah\r\n\r\n241 haha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMind if I record? \r\n\r\nMhm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay great. So when did you start your BUDS class and is this your first BUDS experience?\r\n\r\nUh, it is yes. I am an original 331 member. Classed up I think August. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and then how many siblings do you.. I am just going to ask random questions about your background and it might seem random but there is a method to it. So how many siblings do you have and what is your birth order?\r\n\r\nI am an only child. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly? \r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay and then were your parents married, separated, divorced? \r\n\r\nThey\u2019re divorced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what was your relationship to them? \r\n\r\nMe and my mom were close. Me and my dad have always had a poor relation (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and what would you say were life changing events that happened to you prior to BUDS and whatever you think is life changing that\u2019s what I want to hear about?  If any. \r\n\r\nUmm, I\u2019d say the first one was like when my dad went to jail in high school. He was like 20 years in when he came out of jail and went back in so he was pretty much been in and out of jail since high school. Uhh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did that affect you coming to BUDS or your experience here? \r\n\r\nUh I don\u2019t know. I guess it destabilized um like my uh I guess like my uh expectation on the future. Expectation of what (unintelligible). Family and all that and it kind of like took meaning away from my life. (unintelligible) I guess like finding my own. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother life changing that I would say is probably like pursuit in soccer career. I really wanted to be a soccer player since I was young. And um and when I was like 23 years I was like it's just not working out. Soccer was like my identity pretty much. So I basically had my identity taken away from me now. I had to wake up and find meaning and figure out what I was going to do with my life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have an injury or you just\u2026\r\n\r\nNo it's just tried out for various teams didn\u2019t really get signed. So you know, basically just didn\u2019t make it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay and how do you think your personality helped you get through BUD/S? Anything specific?\r\n\r\nUm uh I don\u2019t know I just I think. I was just thinking about this yesterday like I guess for just some reason I guess I just I can\u2019t like been seen as weak. So I can\u2019t quite like not like be impressed (unintelligible) at the top like I just can\u2019t allow myself to be weak. (unintelligible) can\u2019t allow myself to quit or seen as not good enough (unintelligible) if others are doing it, there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t do it. Ya know (unintelligible)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n What about your background led you to want to be a SEAL like do you have any SEALs that are family or friends, do you have military? \r\n\r\nUh no, I just played a video game in like seventh grade that taught me that (unintelligible)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Long Pause with a lot of background noise as CDR Ledford comes in the background speaking of seeing Patti after you\u2019re done**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay so you played a video in seventh grade? \r\n\r\nI played a video game and like I can\u2019t explain why but I was just fascinated by like secret soldier quiet. Um I don\u2019t know if you want me to get into this but I kind of thought about why I would like that type of I dont know like career maybe is because is like through my personality I like being like more discreet. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s my only self analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat helps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I don\u2019t know. Yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what about when you were a child.  Like how, what was your parents disciplining style, did they spank you, did they give you timeouts, Do push ups, withholding toys? \r\n\r\nMy dad I think he was in the military. I\u2019m from Ukraine. My dad\u2019s Russian. So he was pretty strict. Yeah, I don't know forceful. So yeah, I mean you know he whipped me a few times. He was pretty aggressive and like intimidating so. I don\u2019t know. Growing up I was always kind of scared of my dad. He was like mean to me and like uh yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about your mom? \r\n\r\nMy mom she was uh, my mom, she was nice but she was also kind of scary. My dad, when he got like aggressive or whatever. There\u2019s only so much she can do. My dad, he was head of the household. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure. Was your mom Russian? Ukranian, also?\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah. They all spoke Russian. My mom is from Ukraine. My dad is from Russia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot when you were a kid? \r\n\r\nJust moved once. Maybe twice. *Clears throat* so I was born in Ukraine. I lived with my grandma. My dad kind of wasn\u2019t around. And my dad like took my mom to (unintelligible) to kind of set a foundation up. Find a place to live, find jobs. So I lived with my grandma until I was like 6. Then they brought me over. Um, (uintelligible) when I was a kid here I was kind of shy.  I was never that close with my dad because he wasn\u2019t around that much. So I was closer to my grandma and my mom. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Okay, and tell me about your teenage years, high school, middle school, did you participate in sports and what kind if you did?\r\n\r\nI used to do all kinds of sports. Like basketball, baseball, uh soccer mainly. Soccer and sports also kind of kept me sane I guess. Like I was always scared of my house and wanted to get out. So you know sports were like my solace. Helped me make friends and stuff. Um so yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what did you do in the last 5 years of your life prior to going to BUD/S?  \r\n\r\nSo I was dating a girl and we lived together. While, finishing up college just playing soccer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you were playing soccer for a college?\r\n\r\nYeah, I was playing soccer and when I graduated I was like trying out for professional teams. And with the girlfriend at the time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat college was that? \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s called Holy Family university. Its a small catholic university. (unintelligible) I was trying to make through with some teams at the time. And yeah uh also looking for work. Pay bills. I had a lot of relationship problems with her. (Unintelligible) Stress until we broke up. It was totally hard to get out of the relationship and when we finally broke up it was kind of like a weight had been lifted. I also had kind of just gave up pursuing soccer. Had to work. But not to get too deep into the weeds, but, I guess like what life is like here, is something about me.(unintelligible) I always knew I had to do something meaningful, something good. I couldn\u2019t just be something (unintelligible)... I don\u2019t know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight, you wanted a..\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t want to be just average. I had to do something. Either a professional soccer player or like I said SEALS (unintelligible) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas Holy Family University Division 1? Division 2? \r\n\r\nIts Division 2. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive? Like do you have tattoos or\u2026 no? Okay. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think was the most challenging part of BUD/S? If you can think of one day that was challenging what was it and what motivated you to push through? \r\n\r\nSo I would say it was probably like Wednesday of Hell week. So like um wednesday my body started breaking down. So like I was not performing well and the instructors kind of honed in on me and some of my own classmates. They can really socially isolate you like social isolation basically felt like no one wanted me there. Uh, that was probably the hardest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n So what made you push through?  And did you feel like you were supported by the group or were they?\r\n\r\nNo, I didn\u2019t feel like I was supported. I felt like no one wanted me there. But and going back to like, I just can\u2019t be seen as weak so I just couldn\u2019t quit. They can drop me, get rid of me, but I can\u2019t just like give up. Whatever happens, happens to me but it is not going to be on my end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any special practices that help you get through like physical, mental, spiritual that help you get to the next thing? \r\n\r\nUm I mean. Practices? Like what kind of practices? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike meditation, or prayer or physical activity. Whatever helps you get grounded. And if you don\u2019t have anything that's fine too. \r\n\r\nI guess just think about my past and know what\u2019s important. And what needs to be done. And its not going to be easy. Remember that. I mean its a philosophy I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and did you have any difficult decisions at BUD/S, if you had something what went through your mind as you made that decision and what did you struggle with? Like classmates cheating or anything like that? And if you didn\u2019t have anything that's fine too. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know. I guess the one thing that was difficult was when I did not do something an instructor asked me to do and I was tempted to like just lie about it. It was basically like \u201cyou owe me 100 8-counts by tomorrow.\u201d I didn\u2019t finish them. I could have easily been like \u201cYeah I did \u2018em\u201d the next day.  It was just like I can\u2019t lie. And I ended up getting in trouble for (unintelligible) the next day. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. No, that\u2019s good. So there\u2019s so many people. You started with this class, Right? So there\u2019s so many people that get rolled, dropped. If you could think of one thing, what made you successful? \r\n\r\nUm, I mean \u201c1.\u201d like I said earlier, like I just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStubborn?\r\n\r\nYeah like I can\u2019t be seen as weak. Like being labeled as weak is like I don\u2019t know. To me that\u2019s like seriously everything. (unintelligible) People seeing me as weak or perceiving myself as weak. And 2. (unintelligible) Whether it is shooting or diving or whatever, I guess I am decently competent, I guess I never really had trouble with like that part. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019re competent, but did you have competency in those things coming in or did you learn quickly or? \r\n\r\nYeah, I guess I was always good at sports so I just had a natural inclination towards athletic things so maybe it just transfers over to here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about those people that you saw quit? What was different about those people than you? \r\n\r\nUhh, I don\u2019t know I guess I am (unintelligible) very introspective for the first half of it. Contemplate the meaning a lot. I guess I can get to understand what\u2019s important in life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n What do you think, did this BUDS experience change you as a person? \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve reached like my lowest lows here. I breakthrough and see that  when you\u2019re at the\r\n\r\nLowest lows, that there\u2019s still hope and everything must pass basically. Everything always\r\n\r\npasses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow, that\u2019s a great lesson. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt always passes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, is there anything else in this interview that I should have asked you that you think that it would be good for the Navy to know if they interview people that come in here? Anything I missed? Oh you should ask this and that will really help? \r\n\r\nI guess to contemplate the meaning of life. (unintelligible) Something along those lines.\r\n\r\nBecause I mean I had my meaning, my direction taken away from me during teenage years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, awesome. I think that's very helpful.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Quinn Barber\r\n\r\nDate: 17AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 247\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 20:19\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Record this. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nParticipant: No, not at all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And then what\u2019s your number?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: 247.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, so when did you start BUD/S and is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: This is my first BUD/S experience.  Uh I started uhm Bo was August 6th or August 8th of 2019 uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Actual BUD/S itself was the beginning September of 2019 as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, so I\u2019m going to ask you some background questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: How many siblings do you have?

But I wouldn\u2019t say as much so as like I guess some other people. I am close with them but I, I feel like there\u2019s people that are a lot closer with their parents like are best friends with their parents and call \u2018em every day. I mean, I probably call my parents like maybe I don\u2019t know twice a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Something like that. Nothing, nothing crazy they\u2019re there and they support me but.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ok, so what would you say any, did you have any life changing events before you came to BUD/S? And whatever you think is life changing is life changing cause there\u2019s not, some people have three things and some people have none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I didn\u2019t have a whole lot so I would say in highschool I wouldn\u2019t say I guess, ya know, life changing is big maybe it's a little bit smaller than that but I, uhm, my mom got married to uhm a guy that lived in Florida and uhm so I kind had lived in uhm Wheaton Illinois its in the Chicago land area, uhm, for my uh entire life up until I was uhm 14 and uhm ended up moving with my mom and uh kinda having to uhm not see my dad anymore kinda had to pick sides between my parents uhm which kinda sucked and uhm there was a whole uh process in Illinois to get that approved with divorced parents and stuff so I had to uhm go through that I actually had my own lawyer and everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: And uhm, had to like go in and talk to the judge and he had to grant uhm, ya know my mom the ability to take me down to Florida. Ended up going to school down there for a year and it was like freshman year of highschool so uhm it was kind of a different adjustment I, I would say Florida the culture is a little bit different and just the kids are different and uhm, eh I went from being like pretty suburban uhm to being really rural uhm so it's just, it was just different uhm but I think it I think I gained a lot from it just being more of a people person and more of ya know could get along with anyone and I think that\u2019s super important just in anything you do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So that specifically from your experience helped you in BUD/S being able to be a people person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm yeah, yeah because that was the first time I mean uhm Wheaton, Illinois there are like, it's like the most churches per square mile in the US. Super conservative town, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of like Billy Graham Wheaton ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yep, yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: College uhm so super uhm Christian town and noth, nothing\u2019s wrong with that but uhm you kinda I think people in the town kinda grow up in their little bubble and there\u2019s a lot of kids that they end up going to Wheaton College to find their spouse and then they end up getting married at 22 and uhm that wasn\u2019t anything that ever really appealed to me uhm but yeah so I, I think getting away from that bubble and kinda getting out of my comfort zone that was big and then uhm college did that a lot for me too uhm before coming here you're able to work with other people from kinda different backgrounds and stuff and I think that\u2019s huge, that\u2019s huge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, what about your personality has contributed to your progression in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, so I think I\u2019m uh pretty hard on myself and pretty self-aware and I think that\u2019s uhm big so I think uh kinda a lot of guys uh don\u2019t they aren\u2019t necessarily like quick learners when it comes to like hey I did this wrong I cant screw that up again kinda thing like everybody here everyone of these guys screwed up at some point uhm and I think it's kinda how you bounce back from that so uh whether it's you not doing well in an evolution or you failing something or uhm even you just not getting along with uhm your peers here or making the wrong call when it came to uhm how we were going to do this or that and just kinda learning and changing from that I think is huge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I think that\u2019s something and uh ya know I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve always kinda realized that this and just anything you\u2019re going to do in life isn\u2019t going to happen overnight uhm and I think that\u2019s really hard for especially the younger guys you see coming in here through the pipeline like 18, 19, right out of highschool, uhm it's hard for those guys to uhm realize that, ya know, we\u2019re not going to wake up tomorrow morning and, and have tridents on our chests so, uhm yeah so I guess those two things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s very mature, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Uhm tell me why did you even want to become a SEAL, like did you have someone in the family that was military?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you read a book, see a movie, play a video game? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, yeah so, I watched a movie Tears of the Sun, it\u2019s a terrible movie. Uhm and uh, I think I was like 8. And I asked my, I was watching with my Dad, I remember. Uhm in our family living room and I asked him what are Navy SEALs and he, he said that they were like the toughest of the tough and tha... I remember him using the phrase that they spit bullets. And I uh, I said, I was 8 years old and I said spittin bullets sounds pretty, pretty frickin\u2019 cool. Uhm, I wanna do that. And uhm, it was just something that culminated and I, I think you get asked that question a thousand times and you can give a thousand different answers, but uhm, at the end of the day at least for me (sigh) like I think there, like the reason, there\u2019s tons of different reasons that I\u2019m here and where I at, ya know, I wanted to be here but I just always felt right man, I was like this is where I\u2019m meant to be this is what I\u2019m meant to do, uhm, I\u2019m a huge believer in God. Uh, I don\u2019t know, I think, I think you kinda have to believe in something uhm, to get through this pipeline. And, and I kinda prayed about it a bunch and uhm just always felt like this is kinda what I was gonna pursue and this is what I was gonna do and ya know this is ultimately what I was gonna, going to do. (Unintelligible, what I was meant to do maybe?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, tell me a little about your childhood. Like how did your parents discipline you? Did you, did you get spanked? Did you get a timeout? Did you have to do physical things?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, so I got spanked, I think my Dad pulled the belt out a couple times. Uhm, I don\u2019t know, nothing out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, yeah, I was uh I was, for the most part like I said I was born in that Wheaton bubble. So I think I was uh, pretty, pretty sheltered as a kid, uhm so I, I didn\u2019t get into a ton of trouble or anything uhm. Ya know I didn\u2019t, I think there\u2019s some, some kids here, that uhm, some of the guys that, ya know, that grew up in really rough homes. I, for the most part I was super fortunate. Uhm, and thank God for that. Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Tell me about...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: your highschool years. Did you, were you on a team sport? Did you have a real close knit community in something that you did? And I know you moved but\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: even middle school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, so, I did uh I always did boy scouts. Uh which was, that was huge for me growing up. You\u2019re just kinda, get, ya know keeps you busy. And, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that I stayed out of a lot of trouble was that I was busy doing stuff all the time. I did cross country, I did hockey, I did indoor track, and I did outdoor track. Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So I was, I was runnin\u2019 or skatin\u2019 most of the time. Uhm I mean there was, there was nights in highschool uhm where like Monday night I would have cross country practice and then I\u2019d go home and get my uniform because we had boy scouts that night. And then Tuesday I would have cross country practice and then I would go home for 2 hours, do homework, eat dinner, and then I had hockey practice for 2 hours. And, and then the same thing was Wednesday night. And like Thursday and Friday I would get a break. But I think towards my senior year that changed because that\u2019s when I got a job, so I was like workin\u2019 those two nights, so it was just like I was always super busy like I didn\u2019t have time to turn to drugs or whatever kids are doin\u2019 nowadays to get in trouble. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S? So, you said you didn\u2019t come straight out of highschool or straight out of college, what\u2019d you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I came straight out of college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Straight out of college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes, yeah, I went\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So you went from highschool to college to? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: enlist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes, yes, uh no, well I\u2019m an officer, so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I, I was in the uhm, uh the ROTC program at Ole Miss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So, yeah, I uh went there uhm tried to get into the Naval Academy, didn\u2019t get in, uhm hindsight glad I didn\u2019t because I enjoyed my college years. Uhm I went to visit Ole Miss and I think I was gonna visit UMaine and couple other colleges. Uh went to Ole Miss and was like game day and uh all the girls were really hot so that was ultimately...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: (Laughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: like why I chose to go there. Kind of a dumb reason, but uhm, my mom was askin\u2019 me. And we got a tour and they were like most Miss America\u2019s of any university in like the U.S. And I was like\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I\u2019m in. (Laughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Sold! I\u2019m here. That\u2019s an easy decision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s alright, I hear a lot of people pick for, because the food that they have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Or the coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: They have starbucks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, (unintelligible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I\u2019ve heard of worse things so. Okay, so would you consider yourself impulsive? I see you have a tattoo. Is that an impulse or did you think about it or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, no. Uh it\u2019s Saint Michael, uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Participant: We\u2019re really Catholic, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, no that was not, not impulsive. Something I\u2019ve thought about. I don\u2019t know, I, I feel like I can\u2019t get any more because I\u2019m an officer and it\u2019s like looked down on, I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m gonna uhm gonna listen to that or follow those kinda unsaid, unsaid rules, but uh yeah, no I wouldn't, I wouldn\u2019t consider myself impulsive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Interviewer: Okay. So what was the most, think of the most challenging day you\u2019ve had here at BUD/S and what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So it was Monday of the 3rd week, of 1st phase so the 3rd week...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Is that Hell Week?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh no, no. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Oh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: No, that\u2019s the 4th week. So the 3rd week uhm, it\u2019s kinda known as, and I think things are changing now, but it, it has been known as like a taper week. So they do like, you have like 2 or 3 days of like normal BUD/S days and then they kind of taper in before you start Hell Week obviously. And uhm, that Monday we had a log PT and we just did count off lunges for days. It was just like and uhm, I was like called out early on, singled out by the instructors for uhm kinda not doin\u2019 well on the lunges and the ends of the log are known as the harder parts and I was, the instructor was like Brynce, you\u2019re gonna stay at the end of the log the entire time. And I said okay, roger that, and uhm and so I was, I was at the end for the rest of the log pt. And they\u2019re, they do them in 3 parts. They\u2019re like half hour incre, ya know, iterations I guess is the right. So, this is like 15 minutes into the first iteration, so I know I\u2019ve got like another hour comin\u2019 at me I\u2019m, I\u2019ma be on the end of that log. Uhm, and I, that was the hardest I\u2019ve ever been worked my entire life like...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: physically. And I was just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So, what helped you get through that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Especially knowing that it wasn\u2019t just like half an hour it was gonna be like the whole\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So, uhm, in the moment I don\u2019t think I really thought about it, I wasn\u2019t like, I didn\u2019t I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just. I guess guys have that like aha moment where they like think about quitting, I didn\u2019t, like, I was like I\u2019m gonna be here. Like, it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re gonna drag me away. Like I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, maybe, probably sounds like super uh I don\u2019t know like...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: No, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: tough of me. But yeah I just, I never thought about that. Uhm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what practices helped you get through mental, spiritual, you said you\u2019re Catholic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, so, uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you say a lot of prayers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: That night I prayered, I prayed a bunch and then I talked to my buddy who\u2019s a couple of classes in front of me. We actually went to college together uhm and we were really good friends, trained all throughout college. He\u2019s in SQT now, uhm, and I called him and he kinda gave me reassurance, uhm. He bas, there was uh, another kid in his class that kinda same sort of thing had happened and he made it through uhm. And he was like I said in the same situation and he was like dude I know you I know you would, uhm, I know you\u2019re not gonna, ya know, you\u2019re aren\u2019t going anywhere kinda thing just like keep your head down and keep pushin\u2019 and\u2026 so that kinda is what I did and ya know, uh, next day\u2019s a new day kinda woke up with a positive attitude and uhm things got a little bit better. Ya know, you\u2019re, you\u2019re kinda so far down at some point you\u2019re like oh it\u2019s gotta get better at some point, so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: (Laughter)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: And then it did, uhm, and like I said uhm, thank God for him and ya know, thank God for these guys supporting me too. Even these dudes that were on my log they knew uh that I was like strugglin\u2019 and, and because of that they, ya know, picked up the slack. So, and it\u2019s ya know everybody\u2019s gotta bad day, ya know? Even the, even the strongest dude in here had a bad day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Absolutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What about you had to make, I\u2019m gonna ask you more about mental things now, if ya had to make a tough decision as an officer, uh, anything any decision that you struggled with. Like turning in a classmate or running someone out because they really shouldn\u2019t be here. What did you think about? What, thr, went through your mind when you made that decision and could you give me an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And I\u2019ve probably heard of about everything that you\u2019re thinking about right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Probably already heard of them.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: You probably, uhm, so we ran three kids out. One, uh one of the land portages we had. We actually ended up runnin\u2019 the boat with four guys, uhm which kinda sucked, ya know, ya jus, ya know, ya jus, you\u2019re like oh I have seven well now I have four uhm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: But, so, what made ya think of, it was okay ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: or that you needed to that person out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So, yeah, so, so some guys are a little different, uhm some officers, they\u2019re all a little different, there\u2019s one guy, like there\u2019s a couple guys in here and it\u2019s like and they knew immediately if that guy wasn\u2019t performing they\u2019re gone. For every dude that I ran out or uhm kinda our boat crew had chose to run out it was normally a guy that was like a, a repeated poor performer, uhm, and was, at, at some point you have to have the realization that like this dude\u2019s gonna get someone hurt if, if he\u2019s here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Ya know? Uhm and it\u2019s uhm it\u2019s a hard decision, but I think at the end of the day like I don\u2019t have any regrets about runnin\u2019 those guys out and I think, hopefully they\u2019re better for it now and hopefully they realize kinda the uhm the decision because I know if I wasn\u2019t performing and it was consistently a problem like I wouldn\u2019t wanna get someone hurt like I wouldn\u2019t wanna be... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: That\u2019s just selfish, and that\u2019s...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Everybody and anybody in this room uhm ya know knows that\u2019s not okay, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S? You\u2019re on that path to be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm. I think that the guys around you make you successful. Uh, I think that speaks ta kinda who you\u2019ve put yourself around (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, so let me ask you opposite. What made, did you notice things that were different about the kids who quit, who left? What made them different than you and the people who are still here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, so I noticed a couple things. So one was, uhm, you would see guys kinda get uhm like it wouldn\u2019t, they would get stuck in like they\u2019re uhm, rock climbers call it your three foot zone or whatever. They\u2019re like only worry about you\u2019re three foot zone, only worry about like what\u2019s right in front of you, what can affect you in like that second. And I think guys, you\u2019d see them with that like thousand foot stare, and they\u2019d just like they would just be completely out of it, they wouldn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t be thinking straight, they\u2019re like thinking like oh, like it\u2019s almost like in a Hell Week, like you\u2019re thinking about that minute you\u2019re in. Like if I\u2019m in the push up position I\u2019m in the push up position. If I\u2019m going to hit the surf I\u2019m going to hit the surf. Where these kids would be like holy shit it\u2019s Monday like we\u2019ve got like three, four more days of this. Like in my mind I was just like ya know I just have to get to the meal or I just have to get through this exercise ya know? It was never, so guys thinkin\u2019 too far ahead and kinda havin\u2019 that thousand foot stare and then uhm you would uh. You would definitely see uhm a guy like start to get, start to get super quiet and stuff and it was when he was uhm kinda comin\u2019 to that realization that this wasn\u2019t for him, uhm whether it be because he wasn\u2019t performing or he wasn\u2019t fittin\u2019 in for, with the guys or guys were kinda pushin\u2019 him out uhm, especially in our class, we\u2019re kinda, we\u2019re known as the class that kinda like ate our own young. Like dudes would be like if you\u2019re not supposed to be... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: You had trouble with your leadership right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, our leadership quit right off the bat like \u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I heard that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, and in Hell Week so, but it was like dudes were really hard on each other. Uhm and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be or, or anything. But ya know ultimately like that weeded out a lot of individuals, so.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And ultimately how do you think this whole experience at mud, at BUD/S has changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I think I have a better idea of like what\u2019s, what\u2019s possible and what uhm myself and these group of guys are kinda capable of and I think that\u2019s really cool uhm. And I think I\u2019m uh I don\u2019t know just a better person from it. I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve grown a ton uhm I am a lot more grateful for little things (laughter). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Hot water. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, yeah little things like that. Uhm, good food. Uhm, not eatin\u2019 the galley which is (chuckle). Yeah good food, grateful just for little things man, you\u2019ll be like sittin\u2019 at home like playin\u2019 video games and you\u2019re warm and you\u2019re not runnin\u2019 and you\u2019re ju, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re just ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: like I\u2019m so much more content with that than I used to be. Uhm which is kinda, I think is, is huge. I think that\u2019s awesome, even as like from a faith based stand point as well so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Anything that I should\u2019ve asked you? So the Navy\u2019s askin\u2019 us to do this to try to help them be able to pick better candidates to come through BUD/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: (Unintelligible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Is there anything I should\u2019ve asked you that would maybe help illustrate that? That I didn\u2019t ask you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhm, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s kind of a tough ans, or question to answer on the spot. I would kinda ask uhm about uhm just make sure every dude you find is like the, the most selfless dude in the world. Because those are the, those are the guys that are the difference makers. Those are the guys that uhm I, ya know, myself likes to be around and that\u2019s who, who I strive to be to and I think that\u2019s so important man.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, the teams that (unintelligible). Just, uhm, some of these guys come out here and uhm ya know they\u2019re the first to be inside and showerin\u2019 at the end of the day and they\u2019re the, ya know the last person to help out to kinda look for work and stuff and uhm that\u2019s bullshit man. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: You can tell?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, that was very help...\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Robert Finch\r\n\r\nDate: 12 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 257\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 12:53\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 257 (Name not given)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO):  Is this your first BUD/S experience and when did you start?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first BUD/S experience and I started with this class 339 and uhh\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  Congrats, that\u2019s not\u2026 you\u2019re one of the few that started with this class\u2026 wow\u2026 I\u2019m going to ask you some background information now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  How many siblings did you have?  Were they older, younger, girls, boys?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I am the number 3 out of 4.  I have two older sisters and a younger brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  And then are your parents married, separated, divorced?\r\n\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  And what was\u2026 what\u2019s your relationship with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh I\u2019m pretty close with them\u2026 I call them, more than once a week I\u2019d say, on average.  A little more than once a week.  Both of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SIO: Do you have any life changing experience that before you came to BUD/S?  And whatever that means to you is what I mean\u2026 some people say \u201cno I didn\u2019t have anything\u201d, some people give me 5 things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything in particular.  Nothing that really changed or rocked my world or anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Do you think\u2026 how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I think, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more laid back and I don\u2019t really stress about things too much.  That\u2019s what others have pointed out to me.  I really don\u2019t get stressed about things, and uh, just take things as they come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: And tell me about your background that lead you to SEALs.  Do you know anyone who was a SEAL?  Is your family military? Did you watch a movie?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm so my\u2026 (pause) lets see\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t know anybody in this community coming in at all.  Both my parents are military.  They\u2019re both Navy.  My mom was a nurse and my dad was a pilot. Um.  And\u2026 And then just getting exposed to this I don\u2019t know.  It was kind of popular especially in just movies and stuff like that.  It wasn\u2019t like one particular movie or something like that.  I just slowly became exposed to it.  It was always in the back of my head.  Thought about it through college.  And then uh yeah\u2026 and worked some jobs\u2026 And I was like definitely don\u2019t want to work those jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  I\u2019m gonna ask you about that stuff.  But let me ask you a little about your childhood first.  When your parents disciplined you did they give you a timeout, spank you, did they make you do pushups? Did they take things away? What was their main\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhhh a good mix of that.  So I did get the belt growing up.  Umm\u2026 They\u2026 I would have to\u2026  This one I learned in the navy.  Uh my dad probably got it from the Navy.  He would have me write papers, sentences over and over again. Umm yeah they would like ground me, nose in the corner, they tried a lot of different techniques for disciplining.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Yeah.  Parents do.  Um did you move around a lot when you were in your teenage years or childhood?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot so much teenage but childhood.  So I lived in\u2026 I was born in Maryland, don\u2019t remember that at all.  Then lived in Spain for 3 years.  Then went to Newport for a year.  Pensacola for 4 years, then finally moved to Ohio.  And that was when I was 11.  And I was there since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Tell me about your teenage years?  Did you participate in a team sport?  Did you have a community?  Any community that made you close like boy scouts, or church, or\u2026? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I played a lot of soccer, I played baseball and basketball too but soccer was the main sport I played.  Uh throughout high school that\u2019s what I did.  I played year round as I got more into that.  And yeah that\u2019s like more the\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you play on a competitive league, or just your high school or both?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh school and club.  And the high school team we were pretty close.  I guess that\u2019s part of, uhh, I guess why I wanted to do something like this too.  Kinda like the camaraderie of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIQ: I\u2019m amazed at how many soccer players we have.  I mean I\u2019ve interviewed 12 people and probably 5 of have been soccer players.  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a correlation, we\u2019ll find out.  Um so what did you do in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S?  You went to high school and then you went\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I\u2019m 24 now.  I went to college it was a 5-year program uhhh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the name of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Cincinnati and uhh got a\u2026 Their engineering degree program is 5 years.  So did that.  And then I knew I was gonna come here at that point.  Had some extra money because I worked co-ops.  Um and decided with that I was just gonna go backpacking in Europe for a bit so I did that for a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How did you know you were gonna come here?  Did you have a contract?  An enlistment contract?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm well I just knew I was, this was what I was going to do as a job.  That I was going to join the Navy.  And I initially was going to try to go officer route, researched it, everything more, talked to recruiters, and then decided to go enlisted and I was like well enlisted I can do at any time.  So that\u2019s why, and I always wanted to do backpacking too so I decided to do that.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Cool.  Would you consider yourself impulsive?  Like do you have any tattoos or do you like to binge drink?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I don\u2019t have any tattoos.  Or I\u2019m not a big drinker (unintelligible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Think about your hardest day that you had here.  What was it, and what motivated you to push through that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmmm I\u2019m kind of split between two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay give me both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of them I remember.  I think it was the first logs of first phase.  And our boat crew struggled pretty bad and I thought that I was\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that I was the cause of us being pretty weak that day but I definitely struggled pretty hard and I was not helping by any means and that was\u2026 uhhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know.   I talked to the guys about it and they said they thought I did fine and then I just kept going.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then what was your second?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond was uh\u2026 In Hell Week I remember waking up from the naps on Wednesday night and hitting the surf there.  That was extremely painful.  The last place I wanted to be.  And that was like...  I remember my head was so messed up that I was like falling\u2026 I fell like 5 times, my sense of balance was completely gone.  I couldn\u2019t stand up.  My legs were all swollen and I was like what is happening to my body since that nap.  But yeah you just think of that its eventually going to get better and um that just what we\u2019re going through is temporary.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you feel like you were supported by the team?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah.  People\u2026 I was particularly one of the more messed up guys by the end.  And I had people who were like\u2026  Like I couldn\u2019t really even stand up on my own so my so much when we would hit the surf and stuff like that people would come in and were picking me up.  Uh, yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any practices, like spiritual, mental, meditating, praying, that helped you push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nSurprisingly\u2026 I go to church\u2026 But surprisingly I wouldn\u2019t really say that was like in my thoughts while I was going through.  Like in the moment, that was never really a driving factor.  Even though I am somewhat religious I\u2026 Nah during the moment it wasn\u2019t really playing a big role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Is there a decision that you really struggled with at BUD/S?  Like, turning in a classmate, for cheating or not doing what they said they were gonna do?  What went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know, nothing really comes to mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmmm\u2026 Uhh..  Just taking things as they come.  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t really get shocked by any of the stuff they throw at us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Well let me ask you in a different way.  Did you notice anything different about the soldiers\u2026 or sailors\u2026 who didn\u2019t make it?  Can you describe the differences?  Like if you knew somebody wasn\u2019t going to make it, like what made them stand apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah.  Umm\u2026 For people that I knew that would think they\u2019re not gonna make it a lot of the times it was little events.  Like you would see them really struggle with something or you would see it in their eyes.  A lot of the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So you\u2019re not the first person to say you could see that.  What could you see in their eyes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust kinda like\u2026 just like blank stares\u2026 just kinda thousand yard stare sometimes, or avoiding eye contact.  Um.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Avoiding eye contact?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.  Just kinda looking at the ground.  You could just tell they\u2019re in some deep thought.  I mean the people that were really like, \u201cOh I\u2019m never gonna quit\u201d from day one, they were like trying to put up this front to everybody.  Like they\u2019re cruising through.  Like nothing\u2019s affecting them.  I think a lot of those people went away.  I mean I\u2019m sure you guys all know who Stroke is over there.  He points that out too.  He was one of the guys straight up saying to everybody, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be doing this right now, but I\u2019m just gonna do it anyway.\u201d  The guys that quit wouldn\u2019t say stuff like that.  Like \u201cI really don\u2019t want to be here\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How do you think this experience has changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm it\u2019s made me super confident for sure.  I think taking those surveys, I was definitely more confident in my answers.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSIO: So you\u2019ve noticed a change as you go on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I would say so.  That for this this was one huge unknown to me.  I really didn\u2019t know, coming in, if I\u2019d be able to do it or not.  Uh and then yeah.  Just how fast you learn things here.  Just whatever they throw at you you\u2019ll be able to learn.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO:  So the navy is asking us to do this to try to figure out what makes people successful before they start BUD/S.  Is there anything that I should have asked you?  That helped or hurt you in BUD/S, that I didn\u2019t ask you about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I guess the approach I kind of took coming here, I remember just people coming in\u2026 I think people get way too into the weeds of like what they should necessarily prepare for.  Like people do cold water things to themselves coming in.  Do ridiculous workouts.  And, I remember reading online that don\u2019t worry about any of that just show up in good shape and ready to take what they throw at you.  That\u2019s all you really need to do I think.  People just get way too worried about \u201cOh I\u2019ve got to work on my underwater swimming, or my breath hold\u201d.  Like everything has to be perfect.  Eventually there\u2019s something that you\u2019re not good at.  Everybody runs into something they\u2019re not good at.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t1\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Brad Alexander\r\n\r\nDate: 16 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 263\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 20:22\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did you start BUD/S? Is this your first class or were you rolled?\r\n\r\nI checked into the command June 28th. I started BO in August with 339. So I\u2019ve been with this class the entire time. I have not been rolled. Yeah we started August\u2026 early August I don\u2019t know the date. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow, okay. So I am going to ask you some background questions because they are trying to find out what makes people stay through here\r\n\r\n\tYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what about your siblings? How many siblings do you have? What\u2019s the birth order?\r\n\r\nI have a little brother, I am the youngest.. I mean he\u2019s the youngest, I am the oldest.\tThere\u2019s one sibling. Uhm, we\u2019re not pretty similar. He swims at Georgia Tech and he\u2019s a \tcomputer science major. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, and were your parents married, divorced, or separated?\r\n\r\n\tMy parents were married until the 8th grade then they got divorced. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S? Whatever you determine are life changing events?\r\n\r\n\tI mean I just think I had\u2026 I don\u2019t think there was one life changing event like\u2026 I just went to school and uhh at school I was walking off there were guys uhh I went to Virginia Tech there was a strong Army base there and they were like not an actual base but there is a strong Army program there. So they just had like a lot of mentors that kind of like helped me prepare for this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, are you ROTC or\u2026?\r\n\r\n\tYeah I was ROTC, it was more just like a group of friends and we would train together. And uhh, like were like still really close today and some are here in this pipeline and uhm similar pipelines in the Army. I wouldn\u2019t say that was a life changing event but that definitely impacted who I was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how did that experience help you with what you\u2019re going through here?\r\n\r\n\tI mean A, when you\u2019re just looking at BUD/S you\u2019re not just like hey I wanna make it through BUD/S it's like hey let's go to BUD/S and crush it and it was never a question like am I going to quit. It was like how well you can do on an evolution ya know like people come in with the mindset I don\u2019t need to quit and I think the mindset I learned there is we were always trying to beat each other and compete. So like I just looked at the rest of my class with competition and its like hey I am going to try to beat you guys. Never once was like I don\u2019t want to do this. Ya know to an extent when you\u2019re like hey hit the surf like that sucks but you\u2019re never like oh I am going to quit. It is now a competition, like this surf hit is now a competition, this dive is now a competition, this shooting range is now a competition. That helped me because I have always been a very competitive person so I was just like trying to win and beat everyone else. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd do you think your personality helped with your progression through BUD/S and win you said you were very competitive?\r\n\r\n\tI think so, uhm, uhh\u2026 I am not really sure. I mean yeah I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow describe your background that led to you wanting to be a SEAL? Do you have any family or friends in the military? Or was it your ROTC experience? \r\n\r\n\tUhm, definitely, so my cousin went to the Naval Academy, he\u2019s a pilot in the Marine Corps, he\u2019s a test pilot. So I kinda wanted a career in the military and he\u2019s a pilot uhm, so I thought I wanted to be a pilot and then I remember reading about this and to me the coolest thing about the Teams is the individual is very important but its the team that matters most, ya know. It doesn\u2019t matter how uhh\u2026 amazing an individual is like they will not accomplish the mission by themselves like the only way its possible if you sacrifice everything for the team and the team can accomplish the mission. To me, that\u2019s what drew me, like it doesn\u2019t matter how good you are theres always someone better than you. To me that\u2019s where I wanted to be, like just always\u2026 You\u2019re never the smartest guy in the room in any subject and that\u2019s what drew me here uhh\u2026 And I also think like special operations, I went the officer route, so I think applying special operations to the battlefield is awesome you know it\u2019s just like very creative and thinking outside the box, its like you know superior numbers are gonna when the battle and thats just not true at all there is just so many factors that come into play and I think on the officer side thats just really cool and like yeah we don\u2019t get too shoot as much and were not snipers or breachers, its a whole different MOS and thinking about that and reading about it and like different problem sets you know like commanders and senior enlisted solve and created vietnam and WW2 with the OSS and now yeah pre and post 9/11 thats kind of the career path I wanted to be apart of. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so you graduated ROTC from Virginia Tech?\r\n\r\n\tMhm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me a little bit about your childhood, how were you disciplined, did your parents spank you, did they give you timeouts, with hold toys, what was the norm?\r\n\r\n\tUhm\u2026 my mom used to make me run hills when I was bad and beat our butts I guess. Uhm\u2026 it was more like, man its been a while, uhh.. I think I got timeouts but like I was a very avid reader so I don\u2019t remember that working. They were like go to your room and I was like okay whatever ya know so I was like okay uhh\u2026 I got in school I would get in trouble. In middle school I was in trouble a lot. Not for like, I\u2019d just talk out of terms and whatever uhh\u2026 I definitely think in like middle school I had like problems with authority I guess but then in high school I was like really squared away and like I kinda found this. I swam at a very competitive level too so when like that ramped up I really didn\u2019t have like discipline or behavioral issues cause like your swimming like two times a day, we were doing 12 practices a week you know that was my life, uhm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot in your childhood years?\r\n\r\n\tUhm\u2026 no, I grew up in North Carolina. So my dad worked, he was in the military but he was like gone during the week, it was pretty much just like my mom for the most part raising us. Uhm.. he just like traveled a lot for his job he was like home on the weekends. He was gone Monday through Thursday just about every week from like 5th grade, like till, he still does that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you swim at Virginia Tech?\r\n\r\n\tMhm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what have you done in the last few years of your like prior to BUD/S, did you come straight from ROTC into BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\tMhm, yeah. So I think what helped to was like so I grew up white water kayaking and rock climbing a lot. And uh\u2026 I can white water paddle at a very high, pretty high level, uhm, and I think that had a huge impact on my success here cause like growing up you understand like, it humbles you a lot. To me it\u2019s like you have to stay composed you have to calm cause like the river will kill you. So I think growing up and also like rock climbing and being like understanding that you can\u2019t make mistakes or if you do you\u2019re gonna make them early on and not when it matters, I think  that had a, I think the combination of swimming, rock climbing, and white water kayaking made me very comfortable in the water you know, and especially when like pool comp came around it\u2019s just like what happens when you paddle, you get thrown under until the river lets go of you, uhm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive? Like do you have any tattoos or anything?\r\n\r\n\tI have a tattoo. Uhm, at the time in college I thought it was cool but I will probably get rid of it down the road. Uhm, but I wouldn\u2019t say I am impulsive\u2026 I think I think through decisions and if I make an impulsive decision, I understand like, you know alright if that was a mistake I will eat it and learn from it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was the hardest part about BUD/S? Think through your hardest day and what got you through that?\r\n\r\n\tSo I had like two, in my head, really hard days. The first one was in second phase, I failed an O-course and I have never, that\u2019s the only event in BUD/S that I failed and uhm I was like a top runner in the O-course, so that was like very humbling, I went from like the second faster guy in the class and all of a sudden like randomly failing an O-course. Uhm and that was just like humbling, I was like holy shit like obviously I don\u2019t fail O-courses but it just doesn\u2019t matter BUD/S doesn\u2019t care, it just like humbles you no matter what you know it will keep your ego in check you never know like around the corner you just like, keeping that in check. You know the other and next I worked on it and got faster on the O-course. Every single time I went to run it, it went from like a calm evolution where I was like oh I am just chilling this morning to like alright it\u2019s game time you know so uhm that was a hard day and then probably my other hardest day was on the island when uhm\u2026 I pride myself in like planning ahead uhh I think that\u2019s one of my strengths and being able to think things through and think a couple steps ahead to like see mistakes that i could make personally and also that our class can make just to keep things rolling smoothly. I also pride myself on doing everything I can to prepare for an evolution that will make me successful you know, basically combatting the known knows that I know could go wrong. When were doing a demolition exercise and I totally jacked it up uhm\u2026 like did the tape job wrong and it wasn\u2019t a very good tape job like it was poor attention to detail their which I pride myself on, I didn\u2019t have enough tape with me so I was trying to fix the tape job with the tap I had uhm because of that I guess I got flustered and made a couple more mistakes setting it up and uhm and that was hard because all it took was me paying more attention in the end brief and I was worried about something else like I was worried about my collateral instead of focusing on the evolution. So again you know it kind of re-humbled me uh\u2026 that definitely like\u2026 that sucked uh\u2026 but other than that idk like \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what practices did you like did you have a mental or spiritual practice did you use to help push through when you had those unexpected things to happen, like what made you so you didn\u2019t panic when you didn\u2019t have enough tape or whatever? \r\n\r\n\tLike in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s like\u2026 so when I went through I was just like blank that sucks I guess I was just like I gotta fix this you know, I don\u2019t have like an emotional reaction. I don\u2019t ever like as much as my close friends like I don\u2019t think I have a low emotional intelligence but it\u2019s just like okay fix the problem, you know getting amped up and worked up about it, at the end of the day I could have an emotional breakdown and 30 seconds later once I come down from that I am still stuck with the same decision so you might as well just ignore that and fix the problem and move onto the next problem set. So I am very good at staying calm uhm\u2026 and like I can keep myself in check while like you know, I am pretty good at keeping my emotions in check. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so when you had a difficult decision that you had to make either for yourself or for the team that you were going through, what went through your mind and was there any one decision that you really struggled with? \r\n\r\n\tSo I don\u2019t\u2026 In my peer evals that I got back I can make really hard decisions I am not trying to like I mean my names not on this so I\u2019m not trying to like I mean it doesn\u2019t matter, I can make hard decisions and it's just like what\u2019s best for the team and I pride myself in like it's ingrained into me as an officer you have to like make hard decisions that's what you get paid to do so like I never had a dilemma making a hard decision so I was like here's a decision now what's the best outcome for the team, going back to what I said earlier the individual, yeah they matter but like not really. If this decision is going to hurt like three dudes which usually a hard decision does like sorry guys you know like and honestly those three guys at BUD/S and this isn\u2019t in terms of leadership, it's usually for guys who messed up like if they forgot gear oh you know I don\u2019t want to have to run back up to the range to go get it and maybe it\u2019s like maybe we can get it later and use a truck and it\u2019s like no dude go run up there you know, if I have to go with you, fine let\u2019s go get it so like the whole class doesn\u2019t get in trouble. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you had to boil down your success at BUD/S, you are one of the few people who didn\u2019t get rolled or dropped or anything, what was the one thing that made you successful do you think?\r\n\r\n\tOn paper I am not someone who sticks out but that's something to me that fires me up and it's just like not in a bad way, I would love nothing more than to beat someone who on paper looks like a stud and has been handheld their entire life you know someone who went to the ivy league or the naval academy, you know someone who their entire life has been told how great they are. It's like alright let's go into a dark place and get wet and sandy for a week and let's see if you can make hard decisions not for yourself. I think what it boils down to is will power and like I think the biggest thing is like one of my mentors like he kind of does the same thing for the Army. He used to be the CO at Army\u2019s special forces selection and now he does PhD work for the Army on like, he did a study on what is resiliency and how do you make that in special operations soldiers We would have conversations about this and to me I remember when I was applying to me the guys I train to with are like he was leading the conversation cause he knew where my head was at and I was like yeah man I don\u2019t want to let the guys down you wanna perform and he was like exactly and that\u2019s what we find, hopefully you make it, and this was like three years go, and guys that have done well in this community they are more worried about letting their teammates down and the team down over their own personal comfort and personal success and I think that something that drives me the most 100 percent was like especially when our hell week was secured with such little guys and like yeah our class is bigger now, you don\u2019t want to leave those guys you know. Pre hellweek it was like a lot of competition and like I just wanna win and like before I came here we was like every evolution when your at BUD/S that will power that you have, if you don\u2019t have that will power to win at BUD/S how are you gonna have the will power to win in the battlefield. He was like I promise you no matter how tired you are at BUD/S it will be a joke compared to fighting like on the battlefield. And to me every time I got tired underneath a boat or underneath a log I just thought of like about one day I will be leading in combat and its like I need to push myself as hard as I can so when we win may everyone come home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo did you notice anything about the people who quit or had left?\r\n\r\n\tThey just like were not aggressive to be honest they just like weren\u2019t aggressive and they just had this helpless attitude. Besides I don\u2019t really feel bad for the guys that quit, they honestly needed to go there was like two officers who made like impulsive decisions they were top physical performers and I think it was hard for them because I think that the instructor got in their head and was like hey you guys are failing your boat crew and your boat crew is failing because of you which wasn\u2019t true it\u2019s just like they made an impulsive decision, at the end of the day its just like I go back to making the hard call cause okay if theyre making an impulsive call and that instructor can get in their head then like do they not have the resiliency to be here, I am just an O-1 so I don\u2019t get paid to make those calls, but obviously the pipeline works and I guess there like alright then theyre not supposed to be here. I can still be their friends but you want the best guys next to you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how would you say this has changed you as a person? Anything? \r\n\r\n\tUhm yeah definitely like slowed down more uhm\u2026 not make anything on impulse, slow down, take a breather and look at all my options. Very attentive to detail uhm know when it\u2019s time to go and bring the heat but its controlled aggression you\u2019re not just ever like outta control, I think the way they like explained to us, its like 80 percent you know, you;re moving fast and moving aggressively but in no way are you outta control. So I think that's what I have also learned is like out on the island, is that when you got a team uhm the most important thing is to stay positive no matter what you know its like that something I regretted I wasn\u2019t always like a positive guy but I think from a leadership standpoint you have to use positive reinforcement because everyone here is so self critical of themselves so like whatever I say to a guy I know its not going to make him feel worse than what he is feeling inside because like I do the same thing, uhm\u2026 the second thing that I learned, like the biggest take away uhm\u2026 I don\u2019t know I think thats it.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: ENS Tom Evans\r\n\r\nDate: 10AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 264\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:56\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks. Okay so I have a series of questions. We have 15 minutes to get through as many of them as we can. So far I\u2019ve been able to get through all of them so...umm..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh it was, I reported in July, I think, and it was around August when BO started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Was this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is. Yeah. My original class was 339\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two older siblings.

She runs a home business too so she works a full time job so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Were your parents married?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmhm.\r\n\r\nSIO: What was your relationship to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh it was pretty normal I guess as normal as it can be. Uhh let\u2019s see yeah Dad a lot less than mom but yeah pretty normal relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What if any life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh life changing...uhh I got accepted to the Naval Academy I guess. Went straight from high school to the Naval Academy. That was kinda a wake up call I guess. Almost like first time out of the house sorta deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So how did going to the Naval Academy umm factor in your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm so that\u2019s where I kinda like had to start the pipeline I guess like umm I guess like it starts your junior year at the Academy, so, and like I guess I started preparing like well I  prepared before I got to the Academy I knew I wanted to do it. I knew I wanted to go be a SEAL like umm around it was, I was like 15 or 16 and then heard about the Academy, applied and then kinda like kept that goal of like being a SEAL like as I was at the Academy because I knew I could do both at the Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm people tell me I\u2019m sorta I\u2019m, people tell me I\u2019m kinda quiet like I don\u2019t know like very laid back personality, umm, so I guess I don\u2019t know I never really, I don\u2019t get angry I guess. Yeah, I don\u2019t really give in to my emotions I guess if that makes sense. Kinda like people say I have no emotions so probably why. Don\u2019t really react to things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeard that before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL Community. Do you have any SEALs as family or friends or you said your dad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo my grandpa and Dad were both in the military. They did, my dad did close to thirty and my grandpa did 20. They weren\u2019t SEALs but they were in the Navy. ALways kinda knew I wanted to be in the military. I didn\u2019t know what I could do in the civilian world. SO at a young age I knew I was going to be in the Navy. Umm then I guess through the books, through movies, I think I actually heard my grandpa one day he tells sea stories he says he told me a story about the UDTs that he interacted with on his ship. Dudes that were wearing khaki shorts on the weatherdeck or whatever, smoking cigs, just so that kinda appealed to me a little bit I heard that at a young age and my dad worked in Millington so he brought home some SEALs some SEAL friends. Didn\u2019t really know what their job was you know it was mostly through books and movies probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO tell me a little bit about your childhood. Were you umm, how were you disciplined?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRod and lash I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpankings definitely umm I was kinda umm in elementary school umm I was always kinda a handful always got cause my school is corporal punishment too so umm got some paddlings at school growing up umm and then I\u2019d get busted whenever I got home too. Yeah whenever I needed it which I did a lot so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting on a wooden stool to make your butt raw too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sucked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move around throughout your childhood and teenage years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah we uhh I was  born in Japan uhh we moved around Little Creek in Virginia. I remember early childhood growing up in Virginia Beach uhh went back to Japan. Spent a couple years of my childhood there growing up and then went back to Arkansas, I\u2019m from Arkansas, my family is from Arkansas so that\u2019s where I kinda like grew up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6:55 Uhh so Northwest River Valley so there\u2019s a town called Scranton, Arkansas, 200 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrew up in Fayetteville. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay yeah so I\u2019m..\r\n\r\nIn Hot Springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah yeah I\u2019m like, I\u2019m like an hour like right on the Arkansas River about half, hour and a half east of well I guess southeast of Fayetteville. You know Port Smith?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I\u2019m like an hour and half east on the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. Yeah my Army reserve unit was in Fort Chaffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust outside of Port Smith. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah Fort Chaffee is like 40 minutes away from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: And then after Arkansas, where did?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you go to the Naval Academy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I went straight to the Naval Academy. I was in Arkansas fro third grade until leaving for Annapolis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO tell me about your teenage years. Did you participate in any team sports or activities with a tight knit community?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh yes so my high is pretty, my high school I went to after public school is pretty tight knit group of guys, uhh all boys catholic school. Umm in an monastery so um I played football there umm met some lifelong friends there and it is it was pretty tight knit because everyone was *loud crash* we, we uh, in an all boys school everyone like kinda makes fun of, all the guys going there are kinda like us against the world type of mentality so yeah I played football in highschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in your life in the last five years prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I was at the Academy.\r\n\r\nAt the Academy. Yeah. So you\u2019re straight from the Academy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was the first class out from the Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo they example they asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore indecisive than anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndecisive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm the example they give is whether, for impulsivity, is whether you have any tattoos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope, none. No tattoos. I can\u2019t decide I always tell my friends I could never decide what I\u2019d want to put, that's why I haven't gotten one yet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m almost 50 and I haven't gotten one yet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Think about your hardest day or event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be\u2026 I think the hardest part was\u2026 for me personally it was the biggest thing I had to change was I love to read I, I read through high school all the way going to the Academy and not having time to do what you want. Cause I almost, I almost said the grind, the daily grind was the hardest part, but it was easy waking up everyday. You know, even though you know we were gonna get beat and go and get wet and sandy. That was still easy. It was easier waking up here than it was to go to school at the Academy so I guess like the hardest thing was just having your whole so there was just no time for, for you to do thin..do your hobbies. Yeah probably a compound answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm\u2026 I think...its always been a goal of mine umm.. Friends and family definitely a big part. Never could look my friends and family, I guess yeah being afraid of the shame it would  bring, bring to my close friends and family if you know I gave up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What practice spiritual, mental, physical etc. did you use to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh I went to church, I\u2019m catholic,  went to church every Sunday umm before every big test gate you know always prayed. Uhh I also did some meditation, Wim Hoff, Wim Hoff meditation, a little bit of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Wim Hoff, uhh, just breathing techniques, uhh, I knew of him and did that all the way throughout college and then we actually got a class on Wim Hoff here so umm yeah definitely did that for my meditation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So yeah, so when you made a difficult decision during training what went through your mind as you made that decision? What decisions did you struggle with?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe example that they use is something like turning in a cheating classmate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hardest decision...I think it was mostly just based, I think this program is based on reputation and you don\u2019t want to be known as the guy you know who constantly makes wrong decisions especially like I\u2019m an O so like we always had to make a call like on the log or like under the boat umm. I think..hard...hard decision was trying to get with a good boat crew. Like a solid group of guys that i knew would be at the end of Hell Week. Trying to like hustle my way into their crew to like...is that...like I kinda never doubted that I could make it through, but I also kinda doubted how strong I am I guess like everything like my abilities to make it through like whether I\u2019d be a detriment to their crew or like an asset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh...honestly just...uhh like the...everything they asked me is not hard it's all doable it's just whether you want it or not. I thought the same thing like preparing at the Academy like doing screeners doing screenings at the Academy, physical screenings like I was never like the most physically fit or mentally sharp, but I think when it comes down to it I think it\u2019s whether you want to be there more than others dudes want to be there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those who didn\u2019t make it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm yeah one of the, a good friend of mine dropped like second week during first phase umm he said that he didn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t worth it because he\u2019d gotten engaged and you know didn\u2019t think it was the right place for him and I\u2019m married too. Been married through BUD/S, throughout BUD/S  and I feel like one of the things he said like all big dog SEALs all older SEALs that in passing you know, whether we were working out at the gym or like in a pool I think would always say \u201cit\u2019s worth it, it\u2019s worth it\u201d and like that was probably the biggest motivator knowing that it\u2019s gonna be worth and the guys that aren\u2019t here probably lost that sense that it would be worth it in the end. They\u2019re probably going to go on and do great things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been holding on to those. Last couple of questions uhh how did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh it kinda opens your eyes I feel like uhh this program like just me and my opinion, I feel like what this, what this program does is that it gives you basically is a lifetime, lifetime of lessons all bunched up in like six months..and.. You know part of struggling to experience mentally what happens here over the course of a lifetime and here its kinda condensed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Is there anything else that I should\u2019ve asked that helped or hurt you about BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething that hurt me like uhh...what was the question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Was there anything else that I should\u2019ve asked you about uhh that helped you or hurt you throughout the program?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm yeah no I mean you have to have a certain level of physicality, but a lot of people have the ability to pass all the physical testgates, but it\u2019s definitely uhh...knowing...having a good sense of who you are definitely helps, whether you want it or not or whether you think it\u2019s gonna be worth it in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah sorry I went over there.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Ryan Herrera-Murphy\r\n\r\nDate: 17AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 265\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 16:39\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Welcome is it okay if I record this? \r\n\r\nParticipant:yes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And what's your number ? \r\n\r\nParticipant: 265\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay so i'm going to ask you a bunch of questions to start..and starting out is when did you start BUDS and is this your first BUDS experience? \r\n\r\nParticipant: this is my first buds experience and i'm pretty sure i started in June (mumble) \r\n\r\nInterviewer:Did you start with this class? \r\n\r\nParticipant:  yes \r\n\r\nInterviewer:Okay so you're one of the few that's been in this class congratulations that's pretty awesome.

How did you get that scar when you were trying to defend your mom? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: um it probably made me feel small and also big inna way  i dunno i just feel like just defending her made me realize that i don't like it when someone picks on people smaller than them . i guess if that makes sense I've always done that throughout my life i always defended my mom and sister like growing up especially like in school i didn't like really like bullies like that dudes who were just arrogant where it seemed like they were better than somebody else where they would like mess with little guys were as me I always had like a loud mouth so i would be like leave that person alone or like defend that person in fight because i dunno i just don't like when someone gets into (mumble) \r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay \r\n\r\nParticipant: i think another\r\n\r\nInterviewer: another and the other thing?  \r\n\r\nParticipant: uhhh i think in highschool I was really good at um they had like this little program for um like teenagers it was like a door to door salesman typa thing but like a scholarship program or whatever like you can go on trips and what not I was really good at it like selling things really good at being with people and conversing tryna like mike lil bit um whatcha called\u2026 repetition I was like sailor of the i mean \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Seller? \r\n\r\nParticipant: salesman of the year and also like we had fun and stuff like that \r\n\r\nInterviewer: that's good what about your personality then has made you successful so far here\r\n\r\nParticipant: very uhh dark times i was pondering about a lot of things i noticed that in your survey it was one of those questions I always i love that when things are crappy I always like laugh about it or make a joke about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: that's an awesome personality trait \r\n\r\nParticipant: yeea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer:everyone around you loves it too \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: yeah like maybe like doing one of the hardest things and i'll maybe like make a joke about it or about somebody else and just like (mumble)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: what in your background led you to becoming a SEAL did you know somebody were your parents in the military like how did you come to SEAL School? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: umm I was always obsessed with the military I asked my dad recently when was i first showing signs of it he told me ever since I was 4 years old  i liked the military i fell in love with WWII when i was in like elementary school like studying everything about it and i didn't really know what I wanted to do in the military but going with i wanted to do something honorable ya know ? I joined the navy and when I joined I had to pick a safe route because my mom told me I couldn't go into combat but I knew I wanted to be in the military. I told her about all the jobs I got selected to do. She was like what about this aircraft mechanic job? She was like that seems fine and I did that. I liked getting greasy and stuff doing a lot of work but I didn't like it. I was just like I can't do this for 30 years of my life. So i was like i always wanted to do something challenging and awesome and i knew the SEALs were out there and i was like i'm in the Navy i wanted to do something that was extremely extremely hard that not a lot of people get to do and if i'm going to do my time in the military i want to do something that i actually like serving that i've got scars from got like a you know like i did a good job \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: yea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I didn have much to lose. I feel like that's what brought me here. The family-like oriented type of community everyone is looking out for each other and not looking out for themselves and being selfish. ummm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: speaking of family um tell me about your childhood when you were little. Like how did your parents or your mom discipline you? Did she spank you, did she give you a time out, did she make you do push ups with holding toys?\r\n\r\nParticipant: uhh she spanked me a lot as a kid uh she like it was uhh she like put me in separate me timeouts kinda but she's changed. I know my dad did that a lot when I was younger. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay did you move around a lot when you were little \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: yeah I actually did. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: Tell me about your teenage years. Were you in a sport or close with any group of kids doing something? \r\n\r\nParticipant: I was always by myself but because I was by myself every group wanted me as a part of their group. I was always kinda doing my own thing. I always wanted to play sports growing up but my family never had money for it. \r\n\r\nInterviewer: yea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: so we couldn't like afford like the gear that i needed but i did always play sports like football soccer im very competitive \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: oh okay imagine that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: yeah \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer:.what did you do for the first 5 years of your life prior to BUDS? Like did you go to highschool or or straight to BUDS but it sounded like you did other things in the navy first. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: mhm from highschool graduated tried to get into the navy and at first they told me no because i had childhood asthma but i got waved for it and then i went to bootcamp went into the navy and then i got stationed in Hawaii for three years and then uhh i did that that was a lot of fun then i trained for this and then i got accepted \r\n\r\nInterviewer: So even when you were in Hawaii you knew you wanted to do this? \r\n\r\nParticipant: mhm \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: would you say that you make impulsive decisions? \r\n\r\nParticipant:I would say 50/50 i do a lot of impulsive decisions i don't have any tattoos or anything like that don't smoke or drink but there are sometimes when i'm just like lets just do it im very spontaneous when i comes to things but i always like think about the pros and cons of things and make good decisions sometimes. \r\n\r\nInterviewer:what was the most challenging or just think of one day that just really sucked here where you thought that maybe this isn't for me what motivated you what motivated you to push through? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I actually had two of those days one day I actually cried but the other day my worst evolution was um logs um it was like a very good grimy work out and i loved it but it was really hard the important was that it was fun though I think logs everytime we did logs \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: you're not the only one to say that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: yea lol \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: log logs \r\n\r\nParticipant:mhm uhh when we did up and down the berm at the end of a log work out I would always think like I'd rather be in bed or id rather be doing something else. Then i realize you know I knew like two gentleman in the teams that like he would always tell me i could do it anybody could do and that makes sense like if chief could do it i could definitely do it like I would think about um all the people who had my back and supported me like i don't wanna let all these people down and i also thought like i don't wanna get rolled i wanna keep going I don't want to do any of this again. The second time was thursday of hell week we had our second nap and then we woke up and then i tried to get out of bed i tried to stand up and i immediately collapsed to the ground and i was like oh snap i tried to stand up again and I couldn't move my leg and then they were like hit the surf then we tried to hit the surf and i was just dragging my leg in the dirt and i hit the surf and they just mad us do it multiple times by that time i was like the only person back from the group so i was just legit mad and crying because like they're gonna notice it or they might drop me I wasn't thinking clearly cause you know it's like thursday so nobody like rolls no body but my emotions got i wasn't thinking straight then I hit the ice boat and my emotions got the best of me like i made it this far i really dont wanna get dropped or rolled because of this my friends were like that's no big deal we're gonna push you through this we got you and i was just like thanks man . And the instructors noticed me tryna run and i couldn't they're like you better get outta that boat and i would like try to run faster and faster but they didn tpull me so .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: did you like finally snap awake or ? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:. Yeah by Friday that's when I started to get emotional like the majority of the day. I felt like I hit my wall but just kept going. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: what practices did you used to get through that like mental moral spiritual things or what did you think about besides you thought about all the people you made it through you could do it though about the people who supported you like did you say a prayer meditate anything else that you can think of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:.um everytime I ate I always prayed even still I always pray uhh help me do great and do good let this food nourish my body please let it take care of my body and give me the strength to keep pushing through and before we started anything i realized i'm always calm before the evolution and everybody is always like nervous or scared. I don't have a lot of events in my life. I've always been calm in stressful situations. That really helped me out i always think about something else or try to not have my heart race. Cause if they are nervous they're gonna make me nervous and if i'm nervous then i already lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: yeah absolutely, were there any difficult situations that you had to make during training like turning in a classmate who was cheating or getting drunk what went through your mind as you made that decision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: um i never really came across that because i tried to stay away from that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay that's fine too how about what made you ultimately successful in completing this a lot of people quit or got rolled or whatever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: i think  honestly i just appreciated how i grew up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: you appreciate what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:how i grew up cause it was just really rough  growing up and I thought it was normal so I always like to talk about what happens you know its hard and it's physically demanding and everything but in my mind i don't feel like it gave me reason to actually walk up to that bell. I dunno I've faced a lot of challenges and everytime  time I face a challenge I'll just be like you know it's whatever, just move on learning a lesson just keep going. I'll never like sticking on it or letting it get the best of me..  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So let me ask the question in an opposite way so what do you think of the people that quit what they didn't have? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I felt like um they didn't have confidence in themselves knowing that they were more than capable of doing it they just didn thave confidence in themselves and they let failure get the best of them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: thanks helpful and then how has this experience changed you as a person. \r\n\r\nParticipant: uhhh it definitely lets me know that i can do a lot of stuff without even thinking about it like um like these 14 mile runs and 5 and a half mile swim i didn't think i could do that and they were just like alright tomorrow we've got this swim going on and you're gonna do it and i just get into the water and do it until i have to stop. That changed my i dunno that's pretty much it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: okay so what should i have asked you the navy has asked us to take all these interview to see what makes people successful at buds is there anything i should've asked you? Thank you for contributing to your success that I didn't ask for? \r\n\r\nParticipant:umm probably like the personality about the class because depending on the class as a whole that's going to make the person feel comfortable or uncomfortable inna class cause that weighs heavy on a person's mind like ohh i don't fit in here or these people are alphas and i'm not an alpha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: i heard this was rough. Did you roll from another class? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: not this is my first class. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: but i've heard this is a tough class. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: in first phase we were like very cut throat towards each other and i didnt like it at first but i see why we did it now because we were trying to weed out the people who are mentally strong enough \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer:do you think it's changed now \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: as far as us being friendly towards each other \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: yea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: yea! We're definitely friendly with each other. It's sorta crazy we still have the same kinda mindset. The third phase is when we became more of a family cosy type towards each other.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: GELBACH\r\n\r\nDate: 20 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 268\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 15:58\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright I'm with participant numbers, ah 268 and the time is 1117, it is 10 Feb and this is Commander Ledford and are you good with me, ah recording this interview?\r\n\r\n Yes, yes\r\n\r\nAwesome thank you, I\u2019ll give you some softball questions you can get started with. Ah. Did you, uh, which BUDS class did you start with?\r\n\r\n Three Three Five.\r\n\r\n Three Three Five?\r\n\r\n Yeah\r\n\r\n OK. Alright, we are going to have to trace this out aren\u2019t we, huh. And was that your first buds experience with 335?\r\n\r\n Yes, yes\r\n\r\n And so what happened with 335?\r\n\r\n Ah, hell week ah had six stress fractures and stress changes in uh my knees, so I ended up being performance rolled Wednesday night after chow. And was in PTRR for a long time.\r\n\r\n PTRR. How long do you think roughly?\r\n\r\n It must have been like six months.\r\n\r\n Six months, oof.\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n And then, and then you went to what class?\r\n\r\nAh, 339 sorry. (unintelligible) guys\r\n\r\n OK, great. Ah, how many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n Ten.\r\n\r\n OK, alright, we are going to have to outline this because I need to know, ages and where you're at and sexes\r\n\r\n OK. Um. Start from the top?\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\nSo my oldest brother is 33.\r\n\r\n So, brother is 33.\r\n\r\n Ah, sister, I want to say 31.\r\n\r\n OK.\r\n\r\n Another brother who is 30.\r\n\r\n 30.\r\n\r\n Ah, sister who is 20-, about to turn 29, probably just turned 29.\r\n\r\n OK.\r\n\r\n Then there is me and my twin brother, we are 27.\r\n\r\n Twin brother.\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n 27. OK.\r\n\r\n Uh, then there is my other brother who is 25. And another brother, (chuckle) who's 23.\r\n\r\n 23\r\n\r\n Sister is 21.\r\n\r\n OK.\r\n\r\n And two twin brothers that are 17.\r\n\r\n Oh my gosh.\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n 17. That is crazy. It must have been awesome.\r\n\r\n It was fun. It was wild.\r\n\r\n To be right in the middle.\r\n\r\n Yea. Financially irresponsible, but yea.\r\n\r\n (laughs). Umm, parents, married, separated, divorced?\r\n\r\n Married.\r\n\r\n The whole time?\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n And how's your relationship with your parents?\r\n\r\n We are a close family, (unintelligible) very, very well.\r\n\r\n But um, looking back to, your life, what kind of life changing events, either big pinnacle events, that really influence you more than anything?\r\n\r\n Um, yah, I would say my dad. He was a, he was a captain on a, for a shipping company. He ended up, ah, he had this, um, he got this thing in his eyes so he lost his license for the Coast Guard. So he lost, he's not blind, but he's like legally blind. Ah. It became, I don\u2019t know how old I was, I was probably 10 when it happened. It became financially hard and we kinda struggled for a little while. And that was kinda like a negative part of it but a positive part of it is like looking back now like seeing my dad get that hit. Like he, you know he took it like you know, he took it on the chin and he was a great dad and figured out how to provide for 11 kids which is, I can't imagine now how he did it. It's pretty cool now looking back. That was a good (unintelligible).\r\n\r\nHow do you feel like that helped you at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, there was never like a point where I thought about it, but I think, just the way he raised us, I don\u2019t know, just like his example, you know, so you can put up with that but what he did was probably harder than BUD/S so, mentally.\r\n\r\n What do you think it is about your personality that has contributed towards getting you through this?\r\n\r\n I like to laugh, ah I like jokes. I like to make people laugh.\r\n\r\n How about your background, um, do you have any SEAL friends or family, military?\r\n\r\n I have two brothers.\r\n\r\n Two brothers, that are what?\r\n\r\n Yea, one is in the Teams, and one is about to check into Team Seven in two weeks.\r\n\r\n Ah, so two brothers in the Teams, look at you. And they are both older?\r\n\r\n One is my twin and one\u2019s older.\r\n\r\nOh. So that really influenced you? When they came in here?\r\n\r\n I think, like we always, like when we were young, it wasn't like one decided to go out and do this. We always talked about it, us three. I think them going through it made it seem more achievable because they're human. You know? I know they're human and their weaknesses and everything isn't like before it's like you read the books you think everybody's superhuman, but reality is they\u2019re not, I think that helps.\r\n\r\n But tell me a little bit about your childhood. Like how are you disciplined as a child? Did your parents spank you, withhold toys? Were they strict?\r\n\r\n Yes, they did. Not super strict, but they\u2019d spank us, made us work, do chores, from a fairly young age.\r\n\r\n How about, um did you guys move around at all?\r\n\r\n Um when I was, we only, I only moved once when I was like five so.\r\n\r\n Was it far?\r\n\r\nUh I am from Hawaii, so it's like a different island, so.\r\n\r\n Oh, where? Where in Hawaii?\r\n\r\n Um, I was born in Oahu and then I moved to the Big Island, so.\r\n\r\n Oh, wow, so you grew up on the Big Island?\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n Alright got it.\r\n\r\n You been there?\r\n\r\n Yeah, I did two tours there, both times, I was in K-Bay for one tour and then Pearle City for the other tour.\r\n\r\n SDV?\r\n\r\n Yea, for the second tour, I was a Marine at K-Bay. So teenage years, ah, did you, play any sports, activities?\r\n\r\n I played, ah, Rugby, ah, it wasn't like in high school or college it was like a league, I played that for,\r\n\r\nWhat was that?\r\n\r\n Rugby.\r\n\r\n Oh Rugby.\r\n\r\n I played that for three years and I, I swam.\r\n\r\n Swimming. So you were on that competitive team?\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n So looking back five years prior to coming here, BUDS, why don't you tell me, walk me through your life, those five years before you went to BUDS.\r\n\r\n Ah, I did three years of college. I started when I was 19, I didn\u2019t finish.\r\n\r\n Where? Where did you go?\r\n\r\n At the University of Hawaii, studied history, but I didn\u2019t get my degree.\r\n\r\n What happened then?\r\n\r\n Um, I, that\u2019s where I met my wife. Um, I worked for a couple of years. And like the whole time, I knew I wanted to come here, but I just, I guess, just delaying it, I don\u2019t know\r\n\r\n So what did you work?\r\n\r\n Ah, Construction.\r\n\r\nConstruction. How many years did you do that?\r\n\r\n Almost three years, I guess.\r\n\r\n Three years.\r\n\r\n About three years.\r\n\r\n Now that was in Hawaii? In Oahu?\r\n\r\n Yea.\r\n\r\n Then what?\r\n\r\n Ah, I came here.\r\n\r\n And then?\r\n\r\nYea, the Navy.\r\n\r\n BUD/S\r\n\r\n Coronado for a little over a year.\r\n\r\n Would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nNah, not really.\r\n\r\nTattoos, any tattoos?\r\n\r\n(No Audible Reply)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was the most challenging part of BUD/S for you? Hardest day, event?\r\n\r\nUh, as far as like a single event, I think I really struggled on the CASEVAC, its like the, but honestly I think the hardest part of BUD/S, was, mentally, was probably the PTRR, getting rolled out of Hell Week the first time, like that was hard.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you to push through it?\r\n\r\nI guess, part part of it was family, they held their encouraging, and then I didn\u2019t want to go to the fleet, so(laughs). I, I kind of felt like I only had one way forward.\r\n\r\nWhat practices, um, did you practice anything like on a daily basis like spiritual, mental, physical?\r\n\r\nUh I\u2019m Christian so I, I pray and obviously I\u2019d workout and got a good routine.\r\n\r\nDid you do that every day, did you feel like you did that every day, how long?\r\n\r\nUm almost every day, especially in first phase of the second class consistently, its just about praying.\r\n\r\nHow long would you do that for?\r\n\r\nJust only like a couple minutes in the morning, at night, before I went to bed, (unintelligible).\r\n\r\nDid you ever have to make some kind of difficult decision, like ah, that you really struggled with, while you were at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nAh, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t thought about that.\r\n\r\nLike running out classmates, cheating?\r\n\r\nYeah, there\u2019s, I never cheated, there was. The first, my first class I was pretty like nice to the guys, the second class I didn\u2019t really know anybody, and there was a guy in the class who, he didn\u2019t do very well in Hell Week, I, you know he ended up making it, but I didn\u2019t, I pushed him out all the time. I\u2019m, I used to be a nice person so it was a shock for me kinda honestly.\r\n\r\nSo you pushed him kind of with the intention of trying to get him to quit, making it harder?\r\n\r\nJust, yeah, get out of the boat. I was just, yeah, trying to get him out of the boat. He was dragging us down.\r\n\r\nAnd that surprised you?\r\n\r\nYeah, I don\u2019t know. Usually a pretty nice person. Guess if I was like in survival mode.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think that you were successful at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm, I don\u2019t know there\u2019s probably several things, I don\u2019t think I have like the secret sauce, but, um, most of the guys who, the guys who came off as overhyped usually didn\u2019t make it, like, I don\u2019t know. The guys who were like always saying they were so happy to be here, like, alright, they usually didn\u2019t make, I, I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know if I have any answers. I(unintelligible).  I just found the best(unintelligible).\r\n\r\nDo you think it\u2019s changed you?\r\n\r\nUm, yeah, kind of in a bad way, I, I find myself kind of a little, a little more negative, grouchy, short-tempered. So yeah changes. More moody I guess you could say.(pause) Also, like, I don\u2019t know, I just seem to,  I don\u2019t have as much patience for people not understanding things or even like, I don\u2019t know, even like with my wife I can be a little moody when I come home, and I\u2019ve never been like, I\u2019ve always been a happy dude. I\u2019m hoping that changes after BUD/S.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that you think that I should be asking you or that kinda made a difference, either helped you or hurt you at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nHm, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, you might consider this, but like something that really motivated, is motivating and me is like being around good dudes(pause). There\u2019s a lot of good people here.\r\n\r\nAwesome. Alright, I really appreciate it, Two Six Eight.\r\n\r\nThank you sir.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m turning this off.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jonathan Savage \r\n\r\nDate: 12AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 293\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 12:00 minutes \r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch \r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so I am going to ask you a series of questions and you can answer them the best you can. So, when did you start your BUDS class? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I got here to Coronado August of 2019 and I started first phase in September. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this your first \u2026 Is this your first BUDS experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, this is my first time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nTwo younger brothers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was your parental situation growing up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, my parents got divorced three years ago. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, what is \u2026 you have two younger brothers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sex? Oh, so they are both boys. Were your parents married up until? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah they were for pretty much my entire life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was your relationship with them? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was good, still talk to them everyday. Pretty much everyday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What is the birth order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What is the gender of each sibling? (align with birth order)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: If you think of your life experiences, what might you describe as your crucible or life shaping experiences?\r\n\r\nNot much. Umm, I had a pretty good job that I was in. Nothing catastrophic ever happened. Not a whole lot, just after high school I went to college and then I came here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm, I am pretty stubborn, so umm, I came here to finish and I wasn\u2019t just going to give that up pretty easily. So, uhh, I think that was a big part of it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community.  \r\n\r\nNo, umm, My grandfather, uncle, and cousin were all in the Navy. None of them were SEALs or worked in NSW. Umm, I didn\u2019t really know any growing up. Uhh, pretty much I had heard about them as a kid. Umm, probably just movies or something when I was a little kid. Umm, what kind of got my attention about them when I was a little older was I heard the story of Neil Roberts. He was uhh, killed in Afghanistan in 2002. My mom went to high school with him. I thought it was a cool story and that inspired me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Tell me a little bit about your childhood.  For example, how were you disciplined as a child?  How would you describe your parents parenting style? (spanking, timeouts, withholding toys, etc.).\r\n\r\nI had pretty strict parents. Umm, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpankings? Timeouts? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot so much spankings, but timeouts for sure. Pretty strict curfews. Uhh, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Tell me about your teenage years?  For example, did you move around?  Did you participate in a team sport or an activity with a tight knit community? (ask what specifically that sport or activity was)\r\n\r\nUhh, I grew up in the same town my whole childhood, but we moved houses. Uhh, lived in three different houses before I finished high school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, uhh, I played lacrosse in high school. Umm, I did that year round. Umm, that\u2019s about it for that. I didn\u2019t do any clubs or anything. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last 5 years of your life (prior to BUD/S training)?  Would you consider yourself impulsive?  For example, do you have any tattoos?  \r\n\r\nSo I went to college. Uhh, I went to the University of Oregon for 4 years. Umm, played lacrosse there. Umm, that\u2019s about it. Umm, after I finished there, before I joined the Navy, I just worked construction part time to make some money before I left. \r\n\r\nWere you in ROTC? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I didn\u2019t do anything like that. Just did the normal college thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself impulsive? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, no I don\u2019t. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave to keep these to 15 minutes. I am just making sure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? (Holistic question) (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S)\r\n\r\nUmm, overall, I guess just the grind of doing everything everyday. Very long days. Uhh, knowing that the next day was going to be just as hard. Uhh, in terms of a specific evolution I think the most challenging thing for me was pool comp in 2nd phase. I really thought that one was going to end my BUDS career. I struggled with that one a lot, but finally passed it one the 3rd try. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated to push through?  Did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\nYeah, I definitely felt really supported by the group. Especially my family. Uhh, I knew that they supported me every step of the way and I just knew that I didn\u2019t want to do anything else. So, uhh, I was just going to suck it up and do whatever they through at me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What practices (physical, mental, spiritual) did you utilize to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nUmm, I would say I did a lot of visualization. Especially for things like pool comp. Umm, just closing my eyes, taking a deep breathe, and thinking about what I needed to do. I was going to do it. That was probably the most important for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\nUmm, I am not really sure about that one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the example that is listed here is turning in a cheating classmate. Anything like that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, umm, I was fortunate. I was never really put in a situation like that. Umm,  I never really had any big ethical decisions to make. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Can you provide an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI took a lot of time to prepare to get here. I definitely did my research before hand. I definitely had a good idea of what I was getting myself into and umm, I - I just went in to everyday knowing that today was not going to be day that I quit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSort of just one day at a time? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSort of, and I - I just knew that I was never really worried about - about  quitting like ever. I never - umm, I never really had to talk myself off of a ledge. Uhh, there were definitely plenty of times that I did not want to be here, but I mean, whatever. You just got to do it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those that did not make it?  If so, can you describe those differences?\r\n\r\nUmm, well, there are always some guys you can take one look at and know he is not going to uhh maybe just physically or just know they are not ready. Uhh, they are just not mature enough. Or just uhh, there definitely were some guys that really surprised me and I couldn\u2019t - I never would have guessed that they wouldn\u2019t have. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat they wouldn\u2019t have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat they wouldn\u2019t have made it. If you would have asked me I totally would have thought they would have. Umm, so its kind of hard because it is just a wide spectrum. Umm, I would just say maybe out of the guys that didn\u2019t, maybe they just didn\u2019t have real expectations. They didn\u2019t really know what to expect and they thought it would be different. They didn\u2019t think it would be as hard as it was. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nUmm, uhh, well outside of the obvious that I don\u2019t really like being cold and wet anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, that\u2019s the big one. Umm, it\u2019s definitely the hardest job I have ever had. It's giving me an appreciation for hard work and just being able to wake up everyday and - and uhh really, uhh, really grind. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo is there anything else that I should ask you that helped you or hurt you about BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, not really. I thought BUDS was difficult, but it was totally doable. I don\u2019t really see any reason why someone decent good shape can\u2019t make it. Any able bodied dude.

Well, I'll get to you know the results. And then did you move around a lot or always? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways grown in the same place through my whole life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm any life changing events that happened in your life prior to coming to BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, what is considered a life changing event? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean, anything that I would think is kind of meaningful kind of shaped who you are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't, I don't I don't think so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo nothing stands out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know uh, either great, great highs or great, great lows. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, Yeah. I mean, I mean, I grew up playing sports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm up to college, so I guess there were, you know, but I mean. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t consider. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll Ask you more about that in a minute. Um how about Anything that you think factored into your experience here at BUDS. I mean, cause not many people make it through without so much luck without rolling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I think I know that this is what I want to do and I prepared for it very well. I was very well prepared. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did you prepare for it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I ran a lot um I probably could've swam more more positive and more. But I didn't really have an issue swimming. Uh I read a lot of books. I talk to a lot of different people. I talked to a lot of people who had gone to BUDS all the way through and I feel like I just gathered as much information as they could. So my expectations were appropriate and stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Now did you um. How did you do? How did you know people that went to BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I had two friends that made it through BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm And then just kind of through those networks, have some contact with other people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just go down the rabbit hole to kinda give you a picture of what its gonna be. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, ok  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was. I was never I was never surprised at BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Because you've talked to so many people? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you describe your personality a little bit? How do you think it might contributed to getting through BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh yes, so I'm very I think the various eyes I have a really good sense of humor um...I have a very close knit group of friends and we've also made it all the way through with me. So I think that helps a lot... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they were here in this class? Or they were \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you guys met here or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt boot camp. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so I know we talked a little bit because it went into this. But so what, you really made you want to become a SEAL? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhhh I read I read a lot of books when I was in like middle school, I'd say, and...you know, to be honest, first, it wasn't so much that I wanted to be a SEAL it was that I wanted to go to BUDS you know. I wanted to go to BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was like, that was the challenge and as I kinda learned moreI kind of thought that that would be a good job and maybe even a profession I'd find fulfilling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow did you did anybody in your family military? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh yes, my brother was in the army. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Is he still the army? or? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody else um you were around? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandparents were in the army in Korea, but it wasn't like I I do not come from a military whatsoever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk Um what about um, and these are a little bit of questions but that they kind of help play and eventually. How is your family discipline? Was it strict family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, my uh dad my dad was very strict about sports,. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout uh preparation and training and all that stuff so I think that probably carried over well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when you say preparation, training, what do you mean by that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeaning that he was very, uh very big on like the process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I had to...very similar, uh I don't know, very similar to the military in the sense that \"Ok we're gonna started. We're going to do these drills. We're gonna do this simulation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're going to do X. We're going, you know,  practice outside of practice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd stuff like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about uh discipline at home life? Was there uh time outs, spankings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh so my brother was kind of a problem child I would say \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I was just kind of quiet and just did what I was supposted to do cause I didn't want to give my parents more grief. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I kind of just I always felt like an easy job, but like I just kind of did what I was supposed to do because I was like, you know, even if I did act out of line they probably wouldn't have it in them have it in them to, like, discipline me so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha um what about any, I think I asked you but, uh, any moving around as a child or did you pretty much just stay in Orange County. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I've lived in Orange County my whole life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm teenage years you said you talked, participated in sports. What sports? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I played football and ran track. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk they're kind of different sports to a degrees what was kinda tough to both? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so my dad was really into me playing football. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was I was a pole vaulter in track. That's what I was about. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that's what I went to college for. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Did you kinda was it the one you preferred it more you so why? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI, to be honest I hated both, but I knew that track was a it was a means to an ends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat I would get into a good school and college playing football was (intelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about the last five years since prior coming to BUDS, what have you done? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I uh graduated college in 2017. And then I worked in Phenix commercial real estate for about a year and a half. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then I joined the Navy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. So um even when you were doing commercial real estate, you know this was what. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou were gonna do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what made you kind of do that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI needed I needed time to train. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor BUDS so I wanted to give myself that opportunity. So, you know, in the meantime you need to have a job. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha You can't just support yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah hahaha yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo uh tell me a little bit about anything when you did commerical realestate. Was it tough to you? Did it make life worse? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, commercial real estate is very much like a good old boys kind of profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm it's not like you just are there nine to five, its like its kinda like BUDS where. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's kind of a culture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to being you know like your occupation. But I wouldn't say that that was just like I would say that had a big effect on me making it through here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt just was happen to be like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I specifically chose... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat for that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about training? What type of training would you do? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I would run 4 miles every other day. I would swim 1500 meters on those off days. And then I would do some kind of leg workout every other day. So swimming and running would alternate. And then I would lift on the running days. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk um any uh mental and spiritual practice to prep you did?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I um and so it's an additional to working commerical realestate I also worked at a restaurant. Um so I would work seven days a week. I would work easy seventy eighty, sometimes ninety hour weeks because I want to save a lot of money. And in addition to training. So I think that was the mental preparation where I would you know, I would go get in the office at 6 a.m. and then I would leave the restaurant at like 10 p.m. and then I would go work out for an hour or two hours. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about impulsive, do you consider yourself and impulsive at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes yep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you talk to me a little bit about that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure um...uh so I bought a I bought a, now this is 2 or 3 years ago, I would say I am less impulsive now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut like I bought a like used truck. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMhmm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a 1997 and sight unseen by from the state of Washington. And it just showed up because it was before I moved out. My parents were just like \"Woah!, Like what's that all about?\" I was like, oh, yeah. Um moved to Arizona. I'm kind of like an impulse. Like I'm from Orange County. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd went out there and I was like, I'm gonna go to (intelligible) Um, uh getting to work real estate was impulsive getting the restaurant job inside  that was I would say impulsive like there wasn't like any I didn't have like, great reason to go do those jobs,. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo those things specifically I just kind of signed up. So that's what I wanna do know uh and then when I joined the Navy, my parents saw that is very impulsive because they didn't know that I was they thought that I had kind of moved on that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then they were like, \"Woah OK\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha now you're doing this \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about tattoos? Do you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. So, yeah, I don't have I don't have tattoos but. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMe and my buddies uh joke that the guys with the coolest, you know most extravagant tattoos were the first ones to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell there might be a reason we're asking that question hahaha. Yeah, I don't know. We kind of kind of curious because there may be something to do with that question. Um what about uh what do you think the most challenging part of BUDS was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh so on paper, the most challenging thing that I thought at BUDS is pistol qualification. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I didn't have any real problems with first phase I failed a swim, but all but one swim pair passed that swim or I'm sorry, all but one swim pair failed that swim. So everybody failed except for one pair. And then I passed everything on first time, the second phase and then third phase I almost went home for piston qual. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI failed it twice. I then barely passed the third time. Um but I said the most difficult thing was Hell Week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So what about Hell Week sucks so much? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about it sucks so much? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was just cold and tired and just don't want to do it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic physiology. I still haven't found a world character. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd like infinite infinite strength in cardiovascular endurance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Nobody does. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about um for both of those. I mean, what pushed you to geth through when you failed with the swim qualification? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo a big motivator in BUDS is is uh a part for me at least is the fear of failure over want for success? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMkk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause if you get rolled, you can lose all your friends. Especially with pistol, you literally you literally go home eight or nine days before you finish. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich would suck. Um...so yeah, I'd say that's a big one. Losing your friends, I think was the worst thing and having to for me at least really go into the class, have to see, you know, it would be fun to meet a bunch of people, but like also you really, really bummed to see your friends go on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd like graduated guys you're are like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you're still there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill in BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what is the group component um was that a big motivator for you? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think. Yeah, I think uh that might be one of the subconscious things. But I was like, I'm not...I don't understand what like I never like I was never going to quit. But it like it wasn't like that. You know, reality was I wasn't aware of that reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't think, you know, OK, like, this really starts right now like I don't have to be here. And I mean, I think a lot, yes. I think a big component say, well, my buddy still here so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Was there any like outward support um that help from kinda your group uh? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I don't think there was ever a like any like, come on man like I'm like on my edge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike come back. No it wasn't like that. But by the way, they never trust that those guys 100 percent of the time, even if they you get brought back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat they will. It was true when I've experienced it, too. No, I don't think so. I mean, I think it's just again, I think it's like unconscious. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubconscious kind of the thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust kind of knowing \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's people there. Um any specific uh practices that you utilize to help you push you through this hell week or any other challenging. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh segmentation. I think everything I mean, it's like cheesy as it sounds. I think everything that they just like the whole visualization, arousal control goal setting and so forth. I think that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that stuff was like, I don't I don't like to admit that. Like, that's like what really helps cause I think it's like, you know, you want move. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah just do it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so forth. But no, that's a totally helps. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo talk to me a little bit about how you segmentation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you use segmentation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh it's kinda of an abstract thing uh for me, with the island since its like, OK, we're going to wake up and we're going to run some more and you're gonna break your right. I think and I think even now, like I notice my brain doing this is like I used to, like, get really anxious about things to come, like, oh, my gosh, seven weeks like I've noticed now that I really just now I do it unconsciously. Where like I just my brain can only do so far forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike in the future...But it wasn't I was always like it's like a number like you know BO and first phase it was like, you know, just like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause you're thinking about. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou think you an infinite like amount of time. Today is an infinity of time. You're like, oh my gosh, what a week this and a month of this. It's why I don't do that anymore. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, um, is there a time where you had to make a difficult decision about or wonder if it is kind of like a moral decision or an ethical decision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I think I think especially in first face, those decisions are played out in a long in like over a longer period of time rather than like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExactly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I like for example, I really like log PT or like you have a boat in your head and you can kind of get away with, like, not carrying your weight, and nobody will really know. and there was a lot of times where like I really had to consciously be like, really? Because that weight just gets transferred to your friend. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo those are like the kind of like the moral issues that I think that that's what really weighs on people. Like if they do quit or if people are quitting is that they like I its that they like I'm at my wit's end. It's just that I can't really carry my weight that much. I feel like I'm letting everyone down. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm anytime you saw somebody else kind of make a make a bigger maybe a moral decision and you had to decide whether to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeak up about that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I mean, so it's called ducking boat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut like when we're like when your friend's head isn't on the boat, that's when it might be. In my opinion, that's like a moral decision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCause like we got weight that gets transferred to the other people and that like knowingly doing it and you're just avoiding the temporary pain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it's like I'm I'm I'm uh forgoing the temporary pain and I'm gonna transfer it to you guys so I can live comfortably, you know what I mean? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to mean that's a moral decision. But to see somebody steal something or I, I'd lie about something like you know, like I can't really remember I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo it's more examples like that. Why do you think you were successful at BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, it's weird to say that cause you go get your ass kicked the whole time, and like you kinda come out the other end and you're like \"aaaaah\" hahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut you made it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, uh yeah I think. Okay, so so the big one is my my body was prepared I think a lot of your guys go away because their bodies break i.e. shin splints and stress fractures. And that's because they just didn't run enough even though, like they're like mentally hard enough and strong enough to like  make it. So like your body has to be able to do it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I have very good joint movement. I am very flexible. I have very good mobility. Both things I, I consciously worked on before I came um. Strong, I have strong legs strong back it's really important to have a strong core for like boats and logs was stuff that gets me like so many people. So we started out I think at BO with one hundred fifty five or so candidates. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we finished Hell Week with 26 and it's not like almost like most of those guys didn't quit most of those guys got rolled or performance dropped. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith their bodies. And so that's about like right out of the gate as I think it's something, you know, a lot of people think of like the helmets on the ground are people that quit? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I don't think that's like even the majority. Um, so, one, my my body was prepared. Uh I think I think pole vaulting since I hated it so much and football cause I hated it so much but I knew it was a means, well pole vault specifically, a means to an end it really scared me. I really hated doing it. But I think that doing that for several years, and like being in that headspace of like this comfort six months of BUDS became doable. Like I like I thought of it It's like one track season, six months. Uh, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything different about those that didn't make it. I mean, other than the ones, like, performance things. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut people that literally quit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. You know, it is weird. The fleet returnees the guys that this is the second time that at BUDS were some of like, like physically we're like the best. Yeah. Like we're the highest performers period in like I thought. No question. You know, I, I don't I don't I don't know why they quit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think maybe that's the reason why I didn't. Because I yeah, I don't, I don't know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, how did this experience change you as a person. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh it makes you definitely more humble. That's for sure. Because at any given point in my friend's and I  talk about this all the time. So I did really well in second phase quote on quote like on paper \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut by no means is going to predict future success in BUDS you know and like, because, like I of a sudden, third phase, like you know for the pistol like it's it's relatively easy. It's not like OC-8 or Hell Week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr It's like it's like this a huge numbers of fit, like it's just like, oh my gosh. All sudden I just. I can't shoot pistol. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so all of my friends have the same stories. They excel in some areas and it just naturally inclined to do well in some things, and then like other things and then like they just like suck like random. And I think that's because the curriculum is so diverse and exacting that you're eventually gonna find your,and they told us that in BUDS, you're eventually going to find something you suck at. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else you think I should ask you either helped or hurt at BUDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, No\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell Perfect \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep, congratulations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.

Um, so if you have any questions about the questions, or clarifications or whatever, let me know. When did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI started BUD/S in August, 2019.\r\n\r\nIs this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have four siblings. I\u2019m the youngest of five, so...\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re the youngest of five? \r\n\r\nYep. \r\n\r\nUm, were they brothers or sisters?\r\n\r\nThree brothers, one sister.\r\n\r\nCan ya, Give me the, just so i can write it down, can you give me the order, like brother sister brother?\r\n\r\nYeah. So it\u2019s my brother Nate, my sister Paige, brother (inaudible at 0:58).\r\n\r\nSo three sisters - three brothers, one sister.\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAnd you\u2019re the youngest?\r\n\r\nMhm.\r\n\r\nWhat was your parental situation growing up?\r\n\r\nUm. Both parents present. Good relationship with my mom and my dad. Um, very blessed. \r\n\r\nWhat is - err, so uh, you\u2019re parents were married?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAnd you had a good relationship?\r\n\r\nYeah..very good relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat uh life-changing ex- uh events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm so my parents, my family moved to Ethiopia, we\u2019re cause we\u2019re missionaries, when I was about 14 so probably say that was the most formative experience for me. Came from a very small town, and then just moving overseas and experiencing a whole another culture, and then kinda going through the culture shock and having to reset all my relationships and stuff, that was, pretty big for me, and opened up my uh horizons a little bit, to see more of the world, from just small town america. \r\n\r\nSo how do you think that experience factored into your experience here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm, I think it definitely motivated me a lot. I was in East Africa, and definitely heard a lot about like the spread of like Islam and a lot of horror stories of what was going on with that, and that kinda motivated me and my decision to come to BUD/S. Um so yeah, it was kinda my why, was just hearing that stuff and wanting to be involved and do something about that so.\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm I've always been stubborn, so haha that definitely helped. Umm.. yeah - I think that's like the biggest thing. I have always been kind of a quiet stubborn dude, so it paid dividends here to just shut up and do your job and not quit. So, worked out well.\r\n\r\nSo, describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community and, what they have in parentheses is: do you have SEALs, any SEALs as family members or friends, or do you have military family? \r\n\r\nNo uh I, no military members in my family so - just grew up watching military movies and stuff and was always very appreciative of people that served and thought it would be cool to serve myself and then like I said growing up overseas a little bit really gave me a passion to kind of defend the American way, and be a part of that.\r\n\r\nSo, how were you disciplined as a child? Spanking? Time-out?\r\n\r\nUmm freely, haha yeah all of the above, spankings, timeouts, yeah. \r\n\r\nGrounding? Anything like that?\r\n\r\nYeah, grounding, pretty much all the, all the traditional means.\r\n\r\nYeah uh all the, anything they can come up with. Did you move around a lot uh during your childhood? I mean you moved to Ethiopia, but.\r\n\r\nYeah, no up until then I lived in the same house for the first fourteen years of my life. Just moved over to Ethiopia, and then kinda came back to the same area up to college when i graduated high school.\r\n\r\nWhere is that? \r\n\r\nGrand Rapids, Michigan.\r\n\r\nSo, so you moved to Ethiopia, when you were like 14? \r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nUntil you went to college?\r\n\r\nYep. I was there for four years.\r\n\r\nDid you participate in any team sports in high school?\r\n\r\nYeah, a lot of them. Played soccer, basketball, volleyball, was on the track team, uh cross country team - it was a small school, so if you were ever athletic, you played everything. So.\r\n\r\nWhat have you done in the last five years of your life prior to coming to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nUm I went to college - I got a chemistry degree. Uh met my wife, got married, um the summer after graduating college. And then, worked as an industrial roofer while I was getting ready to come to BUD/S.\r\n\r\nSo you joined the Navy specifically to come to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah.\r\n\r\nSo how long were you in the Navy before you came to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nAbout four months - two months at boot camp and then two months over at Great Lakes at BUD/S prep, so.\r\n\r\nYeah, uh did you, is that something uh you worked out when you signed up? \r\n\r\nYeah, so I was able to enlist with a contract to come here to BUD/S. Most, most of the first time attendees had kind of similar deal with their (inaudible). Enlisted and came here pretty quick.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nUmm.. maybe a little bit. I haven\u2019t made any like major life decisions impulsively, but maybe in the smaller day-to-day decisions.\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos? That's an example of\u2026\r\n\r\nUh no, haha no tattoos. \r\n\r\nLet me check the time. We\u2019re supposed to go no more than 15 minutes. What was the most challenging component in BUD/S? And it says just think about your hardest day or event. \r\n\r\nYeah I think the hardest part of BUD/S is just when you, when you do mess something up, or like when the class pays for something that you messed up. Like, not even like the guys are going to give you a hard time for it, but you just feel bad for letting down the team.\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you - well -  so not, it wasn\u2019t any particular physical or, um, event, um, that was particularly challenging? I mean all of it was challenging.\r\n\r\nYeah, it was all pretty challenging, I wouldn\u2019t say there was any particular test gate that really stood out to me as being a lot harder than any of the other ones. Um, it was kind of, kinda day-in day-out, just grind. \r\n\r\nDid you feel you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\nYeah, definitely. You become like family with the guys from the class, so. I was a 39 original so I went through hell week with a lot of these guys, became pretty close.\r\n\r\nSo what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, Etc. Did you use to help you through? \r\n\r\nYeah, so I'm uh a Christian, so I'd go to church every Sunday and kind of have a lot of support from that community at my church. I think that's really been big for me to kinda reset on the weekends. It\u2019s just, spending some time in worship.\r\n\r\nSo when you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Now, the example that they use, that they put in the questionnaire, is for example turning in a cheating classmate or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think for me the closest thing to that is just like in hell week making the decision to stop supporting somebody and just decide that it was time for them to go and kind of usher them out the door because they were just going to get people hurt, so. Because, I mean obviously, everybody here, your first instinct is just to help guys along, but then it comes to a point when somebody's not gonna do their part then you kind of just have to get rid of them. And then at that point, I guess what went through my head was just the inevitability of the decision, and doing what\u2019s best for the team even if it doesn\u2019t sit well with you. Umm (inaudible). \r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think I didn\u2019t take anything personally and I never, I never got angry about what they asked us to do, or like said it wasn\u2019t possible. I just...just decided that whatever they said we had to do, I was going to do it. I kind of just made that decision beforehand, so I never had to - it wasn\u2019t like I was revisiting the issue and having to make that decision every time. I just told myself that I was going to make it through and do whatever they said to do, so. That was a big part of why a lot of guys quit, is that they, the start of every evolution they would try to make that decision again and again, rather. I made that decision before I ever joined the Navy, so. \r\n\r\nSpend a lot of energy questioning what you\u2019re told to do. Did you notice anything different about those who did not make it?\r\n\r\nYeah, uhh say like self-doubt was like pretty big with a lot of them. I mean there's a lot of like humble guys here, but I think the trend in like guys that didn't make it was just perceiving themselves as being weaker than other people even if they weren\u2019t. \r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nHumbled me, probably.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I should have asked you, that I didn't ask you about or that helped you or hurt you get through the program?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nOkay, I guess that's it. So. Yeah. Perfect timing.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Brad Alexander\r\n\r\nDate: 16 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 314\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 15:02\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did you start BUD/S and is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\n\tThis is my first BUD/S experience, I started in August of 2019 in class 339 originally.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have and what\u2019s the birth order? Oldest youngest?\r\n\r\n\tI have one older brother, so I am the youngest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere your parents married, separated, or divorced?\r\n\r\n\tUh.. they were married for most of my life and now they are divorced \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo once you were out of the house they were divorced?\r\n\r\n\tYes ma\u2019am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would you consider life changing events that happened to you prior to entering BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\tUhm.. Ooh.. I think my parents' relationship played a big part in my upbringing, uhh.. But at the same time I have had a lot of overseas experience uhh\u2026 I was fortunate enough to travel in college and get a job after University and I think a lot of that really helped me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how did traveling help you or factor into your experience here at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. well, I will kinda answer that in two ways. On a more pragmatic note, it was easy to recall good memories when going through particularly unpleasant events so that kinda like put a smile on my face. Uhh and another way, I got to see individuals who had a lot of struggles in life compared to mine and it put things into perspective so when I had one bad day on the beach or something I thought it was one bad day and I can go back and sleep in a bed which a lot of people I met overseas did not have that luxury so I thought my life really wasn\u2019t that tough at the moment and I should probably just keep going. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo what part of your personality do you think helped contribute to your success at BUD/S? Anything specific?\r\n\r\nYes I am very stubborn and uhh.. I think that helped a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Now describe your background that led to you wanting to be a SEAL? Do you have any SEAL family or friends in the military?\r\n\r\n\tSo not necessarily military in my family but my parents were both law enforcement and I knew from a young age that I wanted to be in the military. I talked to my mom about this before coming here and she said that she remembers my fascination from SEALs from when I was like 5 or 6 and she took me to a book store and there was a book that had SEALs in it and from that point on I took that book everywhere I was. From that point on I decided I wanted to be a frogman, so I picked up SCUBA diving when I was 8 and that\u2019s where I wanted to go but I never really knew any SEALs growing up, I saw the book and thought they were cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me a little bit about your childhood when you were disciplined? Did you get a timeout when you did something wrong? Did you get spanked or have to do a physical activity? \r\n\r\n\tI think it depended on if it was my mom or my dad to come punish me. I think my mom was more like clever psychologically and she would like take things away or give me a punishment I didn\u2019t want. My father was more like spanking or the belt uh\u2026 yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around throughout your teenage years?\r\n\r\n\tUhh no so I was born in Virginia, but I only lived there for 3 years so I don\u2019t really have any memories. I was in South Carolina for my entire uprising all the way through college.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you on a sports team when you were little or high school and what sports was it? Or what did you do that was a tight knit community?\r\n\r\n\tSo that\u2019s actually kind of where I am a little different, growing up I was loner and didn\u2019t really like team sports. Uhm in middle school, or highschool I started playing football but it wasn\u2019t really something I was that into. Uhm in high school I played soccer and managed to become captain of my high school soccer team. We were not very good so it was definitely not based off skill. Uhm and in college I kind of found my own path and in the beginning picked up boxing and mixed martial arts and then found climbing and never turned back. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about the 5 years prior to BUD/S, what were you doing? You said traveling, can you give me any specifics?\r\n\r\n\tAbsolutely, so I worked for a medical non-profit, it's an operation called smile. It is based out of Virginia Beach. Uhm.. my job was a program coordinator, so they do surgical missions, yes they do maxillofacial surgery most cleft lips and cleft palates. So I would recruit the doctors on the mission and do their logistics and I would go and be the onground logistical support. So I did that for almost 3 years. Uhm which was incredible you know I got to go to some awesome locations uhm I went to the Democractic Republic of the Congo, I went to Malawi, Madagascar, uhh China 3 times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you get to pick where you went?\r\n\r\n\tNo I got assigned. You can put preferences out there but, at the end of the day you\u2019re just assigned. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that contributed to you seeing a lot of people less fortunate and having much worse days than you were?\r\n\r\n\tMhm, there is one in particular that I can remember, it was in Congo. Uh there was a man, he brought his son, he was very quiet and just stayed in the back, you could tell he like didn\u2019t really mix well with the rest of the people there and their families and I went and got a translator and talked to him and the reason was he was from a completely different part of the country that we were not doing recruiting in and it took him two weeks by boat to get there and this was his third try and the two years prior he'd come to the mission site cause he heard about it but we hadn\u2019t had missions or they got cancelled and it took about I think three months pay for the journey and he made this twice and failed and finally the third time he came his child needed some surgery and I remember talking to him and I asked him like why would you sacrifice so much to come here for your son and he looked at as if I was a fool and said it\u2019s my son why would I not. I will never forget the power of that man and his dedication. I honestly remember thinking of that during first phase and I was like you know he showed a lot of grit and resolve for his son and sacrificed a lot more than I did, ahh so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself impulsive? Like do you have any tattoos that you got in the spur of the moment. \r\n\r\n\tAhh yes, I am a little impulsive, I do have tattoos that were kind of spur of the moment. Actually I got two tattoos that were both spur of the moment and uhh I kinda own that and then yeah I am impulsive to like reckless behavior a little bit especially when it comes to like the outdoors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were the most challenging components of BUD/S for you? So think about your hardest day ever at BUD/S? What motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\tAhh, week 2 of first phase and it was the day we did logs. It was a Wednesday or tuesday. Uhh..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what made you get through that tough time?\r\n\r\n\tYeah that was my best friend, he quit right before that. Uhm I did know what he was going through when he quit, then I did not do very well and I had about 3 instructors screaming at me telling me I should quit uhm I decided to quit but not until after lunch and I forgot to and I ended up at the next evolution and I was like I guess im here. What got me through? I think it was I\u2019m stubborn, if I was going to go out it was going to be their choice not my own. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\tAhh no, no, ahh i was not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you say that today you are supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\tUhh more so but I think I have a lot of the scars from ahh from that but yeah I think it\u2019s changed a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat practices did you use to help yourself get through like did you have any physical or mental or spiritual that helped you get through the next evolution?\r\n\r\n\tUhm I think self talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI assume positive self talk?\r\n\r\n\tI mean yeah I think negative can also be empowering if you respond well to it but yeah uhh both and goal setting I guess. \r\n\r\nWhen you had to make a difficult decision during BUD/S? What went through your mind can you think of one decision that you struggled with and what did you think about that helped you?\r\n\r\n\tUhh.. that's interesting, I can\u2019t think of any specific instance or instances that uhh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s okay, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?  What do you think it is that helped you be successful?\r\n\r\n\tSo I heard this a lot beforehand and I heard people say you either have it or you don\u2019t and that it is not anything else. Uhh I didn\u2019t like that explanation and I always thought there was something more empirical and can boil it down to. I honestly don\u2019t know, I laugh, cause everyday I wonder if they\u2019re going to figure out that I am still here cause uhm I\u2019m like I shouldn't be here uhm yeah imposter syndrome but also like laughing because I am in company of such great guys and I just feel so average and most things I just don't take for granite that I am here and I try to just enjoy everyday but I have no idea why I am still here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different about those that quit or did not make it? Like what separated you from them?\r\n\r\n\tI think they from the people that I know that quit are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike your best friend?\r\n\r\n\tThey just stopped believing in themselves or they just let it get to them in a way that you have to think about. You have to accept that it is not going to be very fun, you just gotta push on. If you let it like eat you up its gonna be \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think this whole experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\tUhh it definitely made me stronger. It shows your strengths and weaknesses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMentally or physically or\u2026? \r\n\r\n\tUhh mentally, physically, no surely not. It shows your weaknesses but it also allows you to play to your strengths when you see them come out and it teaches you, it really shows you that it is not about physical strength. It is all mental. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything you think I should\u2019ve asked you that you think it would help people interviewing to get it in here? \r\n\r\n\tI think the people who were successful and something that I did that also might have led to my success is taking ownership of your training before you come here. I know the navy puts out a lot of information on their own workouts ya know, but the guys who are here I think everyone took ownership over their training and did their own thing and kind of you know pursued their own workouts which is something that's translates to which they own the program. \r\n\r\nYou weren\u2019t here passively actively wanted to mold themselves to work harder and if they had a problem they were active in fixing it opposed to those that were told they had a problem and were waiting for it to be fixed.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: ENS Daniel Williams\r\n\r\nDate: 19AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 325 \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 13:27\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Raver-Luning\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.

Um, yeah. So kind of, was on the fence about, coming out of high school, if I wanted to go to college or just join the Navy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, had some, had some pressure to go play college football. Um, and I thought if I didn't like it I could always just leave. So then, so I was like, go try it out, and didn't like it, yeah. And came home for thanksgiving break and told my dad I was doing this. He was like, alright, I\u2019m not gonna talk you out of it. And yeah. Went to my recruiter in the fall, and it\u2019s been smooth sailing since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.

Um. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny major purchases without much thought gone into it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. um, no I'm actually in the process of buying a car right now and I'm super, like, diligent about it. I don't want to make any stupid mistakes or anything like that, so. Or do anything crazy, so. No, I\u2019d say I\u2019m really, pretty diligent when it comes to that sort of stuff, so.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What about, what do you think was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Or what was the most challenging part of BUD/S? Whether it was a single day, or a larger\u2026? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say, um, just the, uh, relentlessness of it. Um, there was times in first phase when I\u2019d, where we\u2019d have an extremely hard day, and I\u2019d be like, well there\u2019s no way that it could be that hard the next day. It was. So. I\u2019d say that was probably the biggest thing for me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So what helped you get through that?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, say just keeping a positive attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas that, sorry-. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no, like, specific thing I would do. Anything like, anything I would say to myself in my head. I don\u2019t know I just kind of did it. And, just kept going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny um, with the positive attitude, was it, like, more internal, or was it like, kind of collectively\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitely in-, I'd say both. Internal and, um, being around everybody. Knowing that you're going through the same pain is, um, good. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, any practices that you utilized to get through, um, get through BUD/S? Whether they were spiritual, mental, physical?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNo, I didn't do a whole lot of stretching. I'm not very religious. Um, I mean, for me I was just always at, at the end of the day, just ordering a pizza from Dominos. That was my big thing, so.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, any sort of, lik,e mindset things you did, like, that you thought about? Or just?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I\u2019d say, just thinking about my family. I couldn't...just letting them down was probably the one thing I thought about, um. Other than that, no. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Was there any time that you had to make a difficult decision while training at BUD/S? Um,  Like an ethical or moral type of decision or anything?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, nothing, no, nothing huge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything you saw, maybe somebody else like cutting corners and you had to decide do you speak up? Do you (unintelligible)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I\u2019ve actually, one thing I think we did really well as a class was not cutting any corners. Individually, and as a class whole, so.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: um, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I don't know. Just being quiet, putting my head down, doing what I\u2019m told. Um, because, what, I mean, everyone has their different ways of approaching it. I definitely uh, my thing was just being quiet, putting your head down, just doing what you\u2019re told, and putting out.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Anything different that you noticed about people that made it through BUD/S versus the ones that specifically quit? Not necessarily people who got dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I mean, going through boot camp and everything I\u2019d, like, I\u2019d be like oh that dude is definitely going to make it, and he ended up quitting. And the guys who are still here from my boot camp division, I, if you would have asked me I would have been like, maybe, I don\u2019t know.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think was, was like if you could pinpoint something? Or a couple things?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust, certainly the guys who are still here from my boot camp division, um, and the original 339 class, all super positive dudes, very smart, um, just great attitudes.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person? If at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt, def- yeah, it definitely changed me. Um. definitely had, I can\u2019t, I couldn't exactly say how or why but I feel, I\u2019m definitely different than from when I, from when I joined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else I didn't ask that you think would be good for us to know? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. That was all good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. well great, that's it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinished. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, congratulations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Ryan Herrera-Murphy\r\n\r\nDate: 17AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 328\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 09:39\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Do you mind if I record this?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: It\u2019s okay to record?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. I asked it in the wrong way. And then what was your number?\r\n\r\nParticipant: 328.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. So when did you start BUD/S? Is this your first BUD/S class?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes ma\u2019am, I\u2019ve been with 339 the whole time.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow you\u2019re a rarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Sneaking through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow, that\u2019s awesome. Um, how many siblings do you have? Like older brother, older sister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: I have one older brother and one older sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So you\u2019re the youngest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes ma\u2019am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Were your parents married, separated, divorced?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uhh, married and still are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s also unusual. What life changing events happened to you before you came to BUD/S? Whatever you think is life changing is life changing.\r\n\r\nParticipant:Um, nothing crazy. I hurt myself in high school and that slowed me down for a bit. I was-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Like broke a leg or-? \r\n\r\nParticipant:I was playing football on our high school team in a freak accident in a game and dislocated all my toes and fractured it in twelve places. It was weird. It, uh, slowed me down for a bit. And then coming into the Navy I had a bunch of hardware in there and it felt fine but they wanted me to get it all taken out, so that hurt pretty bad and added another 6 months of waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Wow. So what did-how did those experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: It just makes you make sure you want it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: So what do you think your personality contributed in your success in BUD/S? Like what made you successful in your personality?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nParticipant: Just being a team player. If you don\u2019t- you can be the strongest guy, like by everybody, but you don\u2019t work well with the team, it\u2019s a no go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. And what in your background made you want to be a SEAL? Like did you have anybody in your family who was military, did you read a book when you were little?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, no military. Um, one of my neighbors is in the teams- well was in the teams, and that piqued my interest. Just knowing that I could serve, be physically and mentally challenged, do something real hard, and meet like minded individuals is nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Tell me about a little bit of your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child? Like, did you get time outs, spanking, a belt-?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Um-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: -withholding toys, physical stuff?\r\n\r\nParticipant: My brother and sister were always doing way more than me so I- so I always get.. I don\u2019t know.. Much softer. But, it wasn\u2019t anything crazy: grounded. Nothing physical. I think I got spanked once when I was little and my parents were like \u2018nah okay we don\u2019t really like that\u2019.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Did you move around a lot when you were a kid?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Um, born in Indiana, moved to North Carolina when I was real little, and then moved to Savannah and been there for over 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Military? No? Zero military-\r\n\r\nParticipant: My mom\u2019s job had us move around a little bit while she was in school.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. And then what about your teenage years? Did you participate in sports? \r\n\r\nParticipant: Yes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And were you close with any teams that you were on? What sports were you on?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, I was in sports ever since I was little. I played football, baseball, ran track, wrestled, little bit of everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s nice. What about college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, college just intramurals and stuff. I had just hurt myself senior year of high school, so..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Ah, okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Nothing too crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Any teams that stand out to you as really intense? Like, close bonds with?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Mmm, high school was a lot of fun-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Mhmm-\r\n\r\nParticipant: -just training after school every day with everybody was fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. What did you do in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S? So you went high school, college and then-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: College, and then I had about maybe a year where I was just working, trying to get in shape and then apply and had surgery to get the hardware taken out before they let me back in.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Would you consider yourself impulsive, like do you have tattoos or do you like to binge drink or..?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, no. I don\u2019t drink hardly ever. Maybe once a month. Uh, no tattoos.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. And what is the most- think of the most challenging day you had here at BUD/S, the hardest day you had\u2026 What was that day and what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Probably OC8. I was on my last attempt and had to pass or I\u2019d get rolled or dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: OC8? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, it\u2019s one of the pool diving tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer:.Uh huh. \r\n\r\nParticipant: Open Cert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, gotcha, and um what motivated you to keep going and push through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Just seeing the rest of the guys- there was probably, oh I don\u2019t know, maybe 15 of us that had to do our final test, and just knowing everybody else was already done and I don\u2019t want to get rolled for a swim class.\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Did you feel like the other guys supported you?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah! Everybody always supported us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: What practices did you have? Did you have anything that helped you, uh, push through, like, uh, meditation or spiritual, or.. Anything that you-\r\n\r\nParticipant: Uh, I think just like box breathing, that\u2019s always nice. Slow your heart rate down, and then just keep you from-\r\n\r\nInterviewer: They taught it to you here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: And you think it worked? That it\u2019s helped?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Yeah, it\u2019s good. It mentally and physically helped, you know. Slow your heart rate and then also keeps you, your mind from wandering, to just think about your breathing, just relax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Did you have any difficult decisions that you had to make at BUD/S? Like, um, running a classmate out, or turning in somebody who cheated, and what went through your mind as you did that?\r\n\r\nParticipant: Um, I\u2019ve been with a good group of guys pretty much the whole time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: So, it\u2019s been pretty nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:. Never had anybody dragging us down and the people who physically weren\u2019t as good are still nice guys, so we just keep \u2018em around as long as you can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, um, what, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Got lucky, got a good group of guys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Well lemme ask you a different way, what do you think, did you notice about those who didn\u2019t  make it? Um, do you see any differences between the kids, the people who aren\u2019t here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: It\u2019s pretty clear, you\u2019ll just see them like \u2018Wow, my legs hurt really bad\u2019, they\u2019re not looking to the left and right and being like \u2018so do theirs. I should probably keep going, help them\u2019. You know, just worrying about themself, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can keep going\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: That\u2019s interesting. How do you think this experience has changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant:.Mm, definitely don\u2019t like being cold, that\u2019s my-but, just like gets you a nice group of friends that you can always count on, so that\u2019s nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay, so the Navy is trying to ask us to do this research and these interviews so they can do a better job, we can do a better job at picking who comes to BUD/S. Is there anything you can think of that we should have asked you, or that we can ask people coming into BUD/S? To pick a better group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: Probably.. Have people, the stuff in BO, if people aren\u2019t able to meet those, they have way more to worry about. So maybe, having people come out and run the O-course and run in the sand, like a lot of people show up and haven\u2019t done any of those things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Really? \r\n\r\nParticipant: It\u2019s just too much to deal with. Like having never swim in the ocean, you come out and then swim in circles because you can\u2019t swim straight. It\u2019s just small things that add up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay. Okay.  \r\n\r\nParticipant:.They do it for officers. They should probably-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Okay-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant: -maybe have something like that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer: Yeah. that\u2019s- yeah. That is a good idea. I thought they had it for enlisted, too. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME:\r\n\r\nDate: 18AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 340\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 13:56\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Raver-Luning\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, is it ok if I record this interview?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is your participant ID? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n340 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. 340.

And then, what's kind of, what was your BUD/S process?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, secured with 335, had a broken foot. Uh, took a while to heal, healed up, classed up, end with 3-9. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so you didn't have any classes in between?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd at what point did you break your foot in 335?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, it was right before hell week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. so you, does that mean you start back at the beginning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I secured and then I just continued on as a brown, brown shirt.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): Siblings?

Positive, negative, anything that stands out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm pretty normal. Suburban upbringing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere did you grow up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, bay area, San Clara, so yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, did you kind of, high school, what was kind of your process?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh school, college, then came here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok. and where did you go to college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, Pepperdine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. I know it. I did my MBA there.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! Awesome.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, so except I went to Irvine for the MBA, so I say I paid for it, paid for the view, but went to Irvine. Cause I lived in San Diego for several years. Yeah, I  know it very well. Love Pepperdine. Um, what was your major?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, philosophy and political science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally? So, my undergrad is in philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWait, really? Where did you go to undergrad?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, University of Maryland, uh, Baltimore County, um, so yeah.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmazing. Excellent choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. so philosophy, MBA, PhD in organizational leadership. Very strange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. but I think that's like, the best way to go within academics. I don't know what my next route is either. It's like, eh, we\u2019ll see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you know I've got a little, I've got the philosophy, I've got the practical business and I don't know what a PhD in organizational leadership is considered. Some weird social science. But that's not why we\u2019re here.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Tell me a little about your personality, and kind of how you think it contributed to getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I love to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm just, being inquisitive, and figure out a purpose mindwise in relation to helping others, and um, yeah those two things together I think make it, um, an easier experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Now, what about, what made you want to become part of the SEAL community?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust help. Help and learn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is the best environment to do that um, in every respect. Learn about the social dynamics of the world, about myself, and then be in a position to help them in a unique environment. It's, yeah.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Now did you come from a military family at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Know any SEALs? Anything like that? Special forces? No. so what made you say SEALs versus just any other special forces, or any other\u2026?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, the water. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI played water polo and I loved the water, um, and, I think that was just the final choice within direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh huh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, just want  (unintelligible). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: And at what point did you kind of decide I want to be part of the military? I want to become a SEAL?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was 11 probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. What was that, kind of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust, I want to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, tell me a little bit about your childhood. More specifically, like your parents discipline style. Were they strict? Were they\u2026? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, fair, strict when needed to be, liberal when needed to be, uh, pleasant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was discipline like? Timeouts? Spankings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTimouts, spankings, um, conversation. Just depended on circumstance and whether or not I was capable of understanding what I did wrong and whatnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move around at all during your childhood?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways in the Same house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: what about, tell me a little more about your teenage years? Tell me about the sports you played.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, played water polo, swam, um, that's pretty much it for sports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, were those both in high school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, anything about them, being part of those teams, that you think, other than the water aspect, that helped contribute to your experience here? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I mean, it's a dynamic environment playing water polo. Uh, you have to think within different situations and you have to be physical, but at the same time know when to like (unintelligible). I mean it's the same with any sport though, it's like finding that balance obviously I think that helps in relation to having to work with others. Um.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, what about in the last 5 years? So when did you graduate from Pepperdine and kind of, was there any in between time?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, slight in between time. Graduated in winter of 2017, went home. Uh, started to run, because I hadn't done that. Been in the water my whole life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just worked odd jobs, and then enlisted, and came here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when did you enlist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. So then bootcamp and straight here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uh, Would you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Any tattoos, lots of speeding tickets, anything like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? (Holistic question) (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitment at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Challenging component.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh. um, breaking my foot and having to do hell week knowing that I had a broken foot was, was a doozy. um, but sure better than repeating it all. So. I would say that was hard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What got you through that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, family, I mean I've lived a pretty privileged life and I've had a lot of opportunities afforded to me. Just wanted to, be able to know that, give back and that it's not about me type of deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd know that there's kids around the world who have absolutely nothing.and, Just pretty easy to stop thinking about yourself.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What about, um, so, you had a broken foot, but you still got through hell week. I mean, was there any point where, like, I'm just gonna say I'm injured and come back and, you know. Um, anything that, beyond family, that was really the driving force to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, well I've always seen this as a philosophical quest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Plato's republic, that first we must become a warrior... (unintelligible). And obviously.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me just say something. You're the first person who has brought up Plato's republic in all these interviews, but I love it, so keep going. Sorry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is gonna be tangential, but I guess I\u2019m going down this rabbithole. um, yeah, and then obviously within the psyche of the individual, and overcoming all these different desires in order to better understand yourself, and I think that relation to knowing who you ought to be, uh, is important then removing yourself from the physical equation. And learning whether or not that is actually true, and this place is an excellent environment to learn just that. Um, I guess in a different note, for a different answer. I mean obviously I thought about that, but. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's a great answer. I won't forget this interview for that very reason. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, any other practices you utilized to get through BUD/S? Um, spiritual, mental, physical? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I\u2019m not spiritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um. was there any point uh, where you either had to make a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, like a kind of ethical or moral decision, about, for yourself, or you observed somebody maybe cutting corners and you had to, decided, how will I deal with this situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, no I, I never had uh, a personal encounter with it. Obviously you hear of other people seeing something. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, but, not personally, I had to be the actor in that specific sort of thing. So. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I listed above. Helping others, and wanting to learn. And obviously my wierd, maybe tainted, view of the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Um, why do you think the people that made it through, made it through, versus the people that, specifically, the people that quit, not necessarily the people who got injured? What's the difference I guess?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, just simple desire to forget about yourself. You're not important, you don\u2019t ever deserve a pat on the back. And the people that realize that are able to separate themselves from their, their emotions. I almost feel like their, like prefrontal cortex and amygdala turns off, and they like, start to understand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say, like, maybe that's maybe what's happening. Um, I'd say that's probably the biggest thing.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How has this experience changed-completing BUD/S-changed you as a person, if at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, hasn't changed me. I see this as just simply like an admissions ticket, and I'm still in college and I have a long more way to go, and hopefully I\u2019m successful and have a job within this community and make a difference. But, it's just something that\u2019s necessary to do and no different than completing anything else within the realm of what you view as important. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Anything else that I should have asked that I didn't ask? Maybe a little more about Plato\u2019s Republic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to have a conversation about Plato\u2019s Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a, I\u2019m an Aristotle fan personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI, I am as well. I am as well. Virtue Ethics I think is probably a little bit more compatible with living than, than that. But within the idea of this, I think it's, it's a fun thing to, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, it is. I have to dust my philosophy hat off a little bit. I\u2019m a little rusty. But.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI, I do too. But it\u2019s been nice just being able to read a teeny bit on the side and start to refresh myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. No it's a good thing.

Is there anybody in your family...\r\n\r\nMmm\r\n\r\nFamily friends...\r\n\r\nNo um\r\n\r\nAny military\u2026\r\n\r\nI do, my-my Dad was a Marine um he-uh-he had a pretty cool career he had a bronze star with valor um but my entire li-cause my mom like knew my disdain for school she was like well you\u2019re either going to college or joining the military like you\u2019re-you\u2019re not gonna be a bum or whatever so she always pushed pretty hard for me to join the military but I was like super anti-military like did not want to do it whatsoever um I was a big skateboarder so like I thought I was gonna have a career in skateboarding\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nAnd um\r\n\r\nLike go to those X-X sports?\r\n\r\nX-games or something like that yea um like I started-started getting sponsors and stuff, I thought I was gonna be like able to do that as a career, uh turns out I wasn\u2019t um and then yea just one day I uh I went to the recruiter and uh I wanted to be air traffic controller and um he told me about the PST and so I uh took the PST um got a contract and then figured out BUDS and boot camp figured out about BUDS and boot camp and um just been along for the ride ever since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok um so tell me about your childhood.  For example, um you know you mentioned getting in trouble at school\r\n\r\nMhm\r\n\r\nHow were you disciplined at home \r\n\r\nUm\r\n\r\nSpanking, timeouts, did they take away your video games\r\n\r\nUh all the above, mom was pretty uh pretty hard on me she um she like grew up with a single mother so she like didn\u2019t (unintelligible) for a little bit, she didn\u2019t like want me to be a jerk so yea if I got in trouble she would-she would hit me or like take my things away she was-she was pretty uh strict my entire life um like you know, always had to know where I was going and who I\u2019d be with and stuff like that, she was very much so into that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok did you move around uh throughout your childhood or teenage years?  \r\n\r\nNo um like in the area but like like I was born and raised in the Outer Banks like stayed there\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nTill I came here\r\n\r\nSo same area, different houses maybe?\r\n\r\nYes ma\u2019am \r\n\r\n*pause* so that didn\u2019t um uproot you from school or..\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nYour friends or anything?\r\n\r\nNo \r\n\r\nSo tell me about your teenage years, you um mentioned skateboarding, did you do any team sports or was that skateboarding, were you competing?\r\n\r\nUh I was, I was competing with uh I did play baseball from the time I was like 12 till probably like 16 um I played like pretty competitively I guess like AAU uh showcase teams things like that um \r\n\r\nAnd then you mentioned you quit \r\n\r\nI quit\r\n\r\nYour junior year\r\n\r\nYes..\r\n\r\nWhy\u2019d you quit?\r\n\r\nUm everyone just kinda like I-I really just like the sport everyone kinda started taking it really seriously and uh it seemed a lot less about how fun it was and like firs-first everyone thought they were gonna be a professional baseball player than like just enjoying playing the game um so I didn\u2019t really like that about it um yea I played up until junior year and then just lost the love for it I guess but uh started skateboarding when I was probably like 14 and then I think that kinda replaced baseball which also helped chauffeur that out of my life\r\n\r\nOk and you like the um actual uh feeling of being on the board, did you like the culture around it\r\n\r\nThe..\r\n\r\nThe people...\r\n\r\nThe culture and the people are huge it was um it\u2019s like uh like it\u2019s like cliche but like it was like skate culture is a whole different thing and um no it was it was really cool like uh it took really hard work like you weren\u2019t gonna be good at it without like slamming your head off the ground multiple times like took a lot of hard work um and it was like something that like everyday if you didn\u2019t practice, you weren\u2019t gonna be good so it was cool\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So what have you done in the last 5 years of your life (prior to BUD/S training)?  So you did mention you had some college\r\n\r\nI had some college um \r\n\r\n2 years of college..\r\n\r\n2 years of college\r\n\r\nCan you tell me why you didn\u2019t finish that degree?\r\n\r\nUm I just didn\u2019t like school, I-I went to kinda appease my mom because she said I was either going to college or joining the military and I didn\u2019t want to join the military so college it was. Um but yea I really had no interest in going to college um I was before or during and while I was in college I managed a pizza shop and uh movie theater um 2 separate times, pizza shop and moved away from home and then got a job managing a movie theater so I was doing that while going to school um yea\r\n\r\nAnd um do you think any of those experiences..(unintelligible)\r\n\r\nNo no\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive \r\n\r\nUm yes\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos you just got on a whim or\r\n\r\nI do\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nI have 2, both my tattoos I got on a whim\r\n\r\nOk \r\n\r\nUm but yea I think I think I would actually definitely consider myself impulsive\r\n\r\nReally? Ok um can you give me some more examples \r\n\r\nUm I don\u2019t like..same thing going back to the school I got like pushed in the envelope um and kinda like having fun with life I guess\r\n\r\nWhat about do you get speeding tickets\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019ve gotten a lot of-I\u2019ve been pulled over a lot for seat belts but I\u2019ve never gotten a seat belt ticket but..\r\n\r\nSo you don\u2019t wear seat belts\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t wear seat belts \r\n\r\nNever?\r\n\r\nNo I hate wearing a seat belt\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUm *pause* is it a comfort issue or is it\u2026\r\n\r\nIt is a comfort issue\r\n\r\nOk *pause* have you gotten into any trouble during BUDS for sort of not using your safety gear or..\r\n\r\nUm no\r\n\r\nNot following procedures..\r\n\r\nNo um I\u2019ve only gotten in trouble in BUDS once and it was for losing something so \r\n\r\n(unintelligible)\r\n\r\nLosing something, you know \r\n\r\nSo it wasn\u2019t necessarily..\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like\r\n\r\nEssential.. \r\n\r\nNo no\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is a holistic question so it could be you know thinking about your hardest day or you know was it sort of water or some other challenge\r\n\r\nUm I think the uh I think running um just cause like like uh like before I came here like I wasn\u2019t like nearly as well trained as most the other guys that come here, like the dudes that come here are absolute animals and I was not that um so I think like running because physically like I was not good at it, definitely one of the worst runners and then mentally um everyday like when you had a 4 mile it was like like I selling my soul for that 4 mile like it was like at a huge put out and the whole rest of that day would just be like me recovering from doing that 4 mile so I think like the hardest part of BUDS was like the like slick 4 mile runs was the worst part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok uh so what motivated to push through?\r\n\r\nUm just wanting to pass um like I like I was capable of passing the 4 miles or it was just like like it was hard like it was uh definitely a put out for me to get across the finish line\r\n\r\nSo this is me just sort of going through what I know here but you know you quit baseball when it stopped being fun\r\n\r\nMhm\r\n\r\nYou quit college when it stopped being fun\r\n\r\nMhm\r\n\r\nIt sounds like running wasn\u2019t very much fun \r\n\r\nRunning was not fun\r\n\r\nSo so what was it that you were able to tap into \r\n\r\nUm I don\u2019t know uh maybe just like (unintelligible) um just like being able to imagine what\u2019s on the other side of the 4 mile um realizing that like it is like it\u2019s just a 4 mile and like my life will soon cease to be just 4 mile timed runs like it will be better \r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019d say that\u2019s it\r\n\r\nSo having (unintelligible)\r\n\r\nYes \r\n\r\nSo did you feel so so that sounds like a very internal motivation did you feel supported by the group \r\n\r\nAbsolutely yea um I met some of the greatest dudes here um like best friends like all all of them feel the same way everyone hates 4 miles you know it\u2019s not like I know it\u2019s-it\u2019s not just me having that idea um\r\n\r\nSo sort of a solidarity \r\n\r\nYea \r\n\r\nOk everyone\u2019s suffering\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok did you have any practices like (physical or mental or spiritual) that you used to push through these hard times?\r\n\r\nMmm \r\n\r\nLike a prayer, a mantra or a visualization um you know some athletes before they go into a game will have like a warm-up routine\r\n\r\nUmm\r\n\r\nAnything you\u2019ve used to..\r\n\r\n*pause* I want to say no but like I\u2019m I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something like uh\u2026.um actually yea there was uh there was this movie called Fury um it\u2019s about, I think Brad Pitt\u2019s in it, but they\u2019re like tankers like back in the day I don\u2019t remember which war\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nUm but they always said uh best job I ever had\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nSo maybe that\r\n\r\nSo you said that to your-, so you said that\r\n\r\nOut loud yea to my buddies like it was kinda a funny thing cause obviously it sucked we were saying it\u2019s the best job we ever had and it clearly was horrible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision and were there any decisions you struggled with for example running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate?\r\n\r\nUm yea uh so I wasn\u2019t very big on the whole running people out thing um I-originally when I came through like in 334 like I was like dang that\u2019s like rough um pretty m-mean in my like opinion I thought it was like a very mean thing to do um but in-in 37 we like we did run a couple guys out and it was uh like it wasn\u2019t I don\u2019t-I don\u2019t know why like I think it was for like a uh I think it was more so for morale boost for the guys who were doing well um because like those are the guys you want to keep up and the guys who are like kinda bringing you down you wanna get rid of them so it really doesn\u2019t make sense because even with them not doing well like it makes everything harder because like whatever little weight they\u2019re carrying, they\u2019re still carrying some weight so I think that was just like a like a morale boost for the guys who were doing well so... can you repeat the question again, I\u2019m sorry \r\n\r\nSo hard decisions, so this decision to in fact you know uh shed this er cut them out \r\n\r\nMhm\r\n\r\nRun them out, how did you come to that conclusion to take action to do it \r\n\r\nOh um I think it was um more so decided by anger of like like hearing guys I can\u2019t keep up or like like like the complaining of like guys I\u2019m hurting when everyone is hurting um which is like like uh a poor attitude you didn\u2019t you didn\u2019t want to be around anymore especially when you\u2019re like sleep deprived and tired and stuff like uh I guess the negativity they were bringing was like what did it for me \r\n\r\nSo your decision to you know that-that it was what\u2019s best for the group or..\r\n\r\nYes, I\u2019d say so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uh why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S and then those that dropped like what was going on with that?\r\n\r\nUm I thi-like like again I think like being able to uh to like laugh during the hard times and keep like a like a good head on your shoulders, um never taking yourself too seriously \r\n\r\nLike a positive mental attitude\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nOk and then those who dropped \r\n\r\nI think they just got caught up in their head um cause like I-I by no means was physically superior to really anyone but like I think being able to being able to keep a good head on your shoulders during times that\u2019s very easy to lose yourself in the bad things happening \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - Has this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nUm it\u2019s..it\u2019s made me realize one going through hell week and then also getting rolled then working hell week like like people are capable of doing some insane things and working through a lot uh gives like gives you like an appreciation for the guys you\u2019re around and like the like the caliber of men in this world that are like willing to do this kinda work, it\u2019s pretty impressive\r\n\r\nAnd are you impressed with yourself like\r\n\r\nUh\r\n\r\nLike a confidence boost\r\n\r\nYea I wou-\r\n\r\nOr in awe of everyone else\r\n\r\nLike like I would say so it was it\u2019s uh yea I\u2019m um I\u2019m happy where where I\u2019m at right now\r\n\r\nOk um anything else I haven\u2019t asked that you think would be uh relevant\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nOk so I\u2019ll hit stop\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Loftus\r\n\r\nDate: 23AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: N/A\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 13:55\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): N/A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey so uh this is uh relatively short interview about 15 minutes. Questions are open ended but ya know if you can be somewhat concise then we should get through all of it, but if we dont its not a big deal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm so when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI was actually class 330.\r\n\r\n330? When, do you know, when was that?\r\n\r\nThat was in February 2018.\r\n\r\nSo this isn\u2019t your first, is this your second?\r\n\r\nThis is actually my third, I got injured in Hellweek in 330 and got rolled and got surgery than came back after over a year then in 337 made it through Hellweek but my foot was broken up so I got rolled two classes after Hellweek.\r\n\r\nSo you sort of got rolled twice?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAnd how were you injured in 2018 in 330?\r\n\r\nI uh had a labral tear in my hip and also damage to the (inaudible)\r\n\r\nOh ok. Alright so you joined with 339?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nSo How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have two. Brother and sister.\r\n\r\nUh whats the ordering? Where are you?\r\n\r\nOldest\r\n\r\nYoure the oldest? \r\n\r\nThen sister.\r\n\r\nSo self, sister, brother?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nUh what was your parental situation growing up?\r\n\r\nUh two parents, still married\r\n\r\nMom Dad?\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\nAnd you have, do you have, what's your relationship with them?\r\n\r\n(inaudible 1:59-2:11)\r\n\r\nWhat, if any, life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh I was in the Marine Corps uh I was an infantry officer, I deployed twice. Two deployments to Iraq. \r\n\r\nNo Afghanistan?\r\n\r\n(inaudible 2:35-2:43)\r\n\r\nHow did uh that experience, being a marine officer uh effect your or factor into your experience here?\r\n\r\nUh I think it gave me a little bit of maturity, uh I had my feet underneath me in the military, and it already kind of groomed me to deal with hardship. And then i think it also for my deployments gave me a sense of purpose. Got to work with seasoned SEAL team guys in both deployments.\r\n\r\nSo uh when you left the Marines and uh joined the navy did you change rank?\r\n\r\nI was a captain in the Marine Corps and  Lieutenant in the Navy.\r\n\r\nSo thats what the guy running this research project did right he started in the uh Marine Corps and then came here. How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think I\u2019m pretty good at dealing with failure.I think that kind of helped me I didnt, mostly medically predicated issued that I had, but I think that being able to uh persevere. \r\n\r\nSo when you were injured what did you do in the meantime while you were injured?\r\n\r\nI worked at the CTT, the Combat Training Tank, just at the pool.\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nUh I worked for the BUD/S orientation the indoctrination stuff.\r\n\r\nUm so describe your background um that led you to pursuing becoming a part of the SEAL community? I mean is there anything other than you mentioned you worked with SEALs overseas I guess and you have a military background. Do you have any SEALs as family members or friends? \r\n\r\nI do not.\r\n\r\nAny military family?\r\n\r\nI do uh my father, and my grandfather. \r\n\r\nWhere they in uh\r\n\r\nMy father was in the Army, retired Colonel. And my grandfather was in the Air Force Reserve.\r\n\r\nSo is that what motivated you to join the military to begin with?\r\n\r\nYeah I think so it was kind of what I uh all I knew as a kid. So I think I wanted to do something in the military, and then special forces spoke to me. (inaudible 5:43-5:49) so I ended up being a Marine infantry officer. \r\n\r\nAlright so some questions about your childhood. Um how were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\nUh I think varying times throughout my childhood my dads temperament uh my dad was more physical when I was younger and then he kind of cooled off when I was older. \r\n\r\nSo you were spanked and then what grounded? \r\n\r\nPerfect yeah\r\n\r\nDid you move a lot as a child?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nYes you were an Army Brat right so. What branch was your father in? I know he was in Army but what uh?\r\n\r\nCorps of Engineers\r\n\r\nEngineers? How disappointed is he that you're in the Navy? Uh so in your teen years did you participate in sports uh or other team kinds of events?\r\n\r\nI did uh I played basketball, uh I wrestled for a bit earlier on then I raced motorcross.\r\n\r\nMotorcross? \r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nAny other kind of team activities? Like chess club or\r\n\r\nAh no\r\n\r\nSo the last five years have you, you\u2019ve been in the Marines for the last five years and you just switched to the Navy or?\r\n\r\n(inaudible 8:05-8:10)\r\n\r\nHow long ago did you switch to the Navy?\r\n\r\nSo it was February 2018.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nDid you go to college? To ROTC or?\r\n\r\nNo I did uh Marine Corps Officer Candidate School. \r\n\r\nAfter you finished your college degree?\r\n\r\nNo I did it while I was in college. \r\n\r\nWhile you were in college?\r\n\r\n(inaudible 8:53-8:57)\r\n\r\nWhats your degree in?\r\n\r\nEngineering Technology Education\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S either a day or an event or?\r\n\r\nHellweek.\r\n\r\nHuh? \r\n\r\nHellweek. \r\n\r\nHellweek? \r\n\r\nWhat motivated you to push through it?\r\n\r\nUh a lot of different things I guess if it boils down to one, one big thing its the uh the ability to make a significant impact in the lives of people overseas and I kind of experienced that with my first deployment with the SEALs. That was very fulfilling. \r\n\r\nWhat uh practices did you uh use to push through challenges like physical, mental, spiritual, what techniques?\r\n\r\nUh I think the endstate visualization.\r\n\r\nThe goal?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nVisualizing the goal, achieving the goal?\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nWhen you made a difficult decision uh during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Uh were there any decisions, specific decisions, that you remember having to make. Like examples they list are running a classmate out or uh cheating, turning in a cheater?\r\n\r\nYeah uh running a buddy a couple times running a classmate out of the boat. Leveraging that against like class cohesiveness. Respective implications to the class\u2019 unity.\r\n\r\nSo I guess to some extent you have a lot of expirience that others here don\u2019t having been an officer a Marine officer, uh with making those kinds of decisions. Thinking about unit cohecion versus hurting someone.\r\n\r\nUh why do you think you were successful at completing buds?\r\n\r\nI think it boils down to one thing I think uh the uh maturity and perserverence, resiliency. That was probably predominatley cultivated while in the Marine Corps. \r\n\r\nDid you notice anything about anythything different, characteristic wise, uh about the those who didn't make it through versus those who did?\r\n\r\nI havent really thought about that uh not really honestly. \r\n\r\nHas this experience, and if so how has this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\nI think it has just augmented my ability to perservere. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I should have asked you about that I haven't that helped you or hurt you through this that I didn\u2019t ask you?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think so.\r\n\r\nOk thats it.\r\n\r\nThank you Sir.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Andrew Malick\r\n\r\nDate: 12AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 344 (344_2020.02.10_10.37_012.mp3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 16:08\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Alex Dietrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do I have your permission to record? \r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nOK. And if you would state your participant I.D. number. \r\n\r\n344\r\n\r\nOK. And when did you start your BUD/s class?\r\n\r\nI was with three five, 335. Virtually. I got to Coronado in December of 2018. \r\n\r\nAnd... Is this your first BUD/S experience? \r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): So I'd like to ask you about your family. Are you an only child? And-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm an only child.\r\n\r\nOk, me too. So what are your parents? Married, separated\u2026?\r\n\r\nThey separated when I was like four. \r\n\r\nOK. And are they divorced? \r\n\r\nYeah, they're divorced. \r\n\r\nAnd what's your relationship like with either of them? \r\n\r\nI'm very close with both of them. They have like a good- even after the divorce- they stayed like friends, so it wasn't like a nasty divorce. \r\n\r\nOK. So family dynamics. How often would you say you contact them?\r\n\r\nUh, like now? I still talk to 'em multiple times a week. Not quite everyday, but probably. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO Have there been any life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\nUmmm, not really. \r\n\r\nSo you went through highschool, did you go to college? \r\n\r\nI did. Yeah, I went to college for two years. I guess that's kind of it was kind of this. I just was in college and I was wanting to come to this and kind of told them I was leaving college so I had to finish, which I kind of like, knew what I wanted to do. And I was pretty, you know, like I was pretty set on it. So they weren't they were happy with my decision. Obviously, my dad definitely took it well. My mom at first was like, \"you're not gonna finish college?\", but she was good with it. And then I just left college and came here.\r\n\r\nOK. So that sounds like college might have been a positive for you? \r\n\r\nYeah, I enjoyed college. It was just kind of like I was kind of looking to see what I wanted to do. And nothing really stuck out to me besides this. And I'd like- so something I like thought about growing up, but it was never like, I'm going to go do that until I got to college and kind of started switching majors a few times. And I was like, \"you know what, honestly, I want to do this.\" I don't want to be in college. \r\n\r\nSo you had to learn to be more independent?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nTake initiative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality affected your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n Pretty easy going guy. I think that helps a lot of the hard times. You just kind of got to find the humor in it and get through it. It's not like if you dwell on everything, like, I feel like it would build on you and be pretty heavy. But I'm just kind of roll with the punches through it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: OK. You mentioned that you have sort of always been interested in the SEAL community. What got you interested in the SEALs and what led you done this path? Do you have any family or friends that were? \r\n\r\nI don't really know. I kind of I think I learned about them on a young age. I don't really know exactly how. And then-. \r\n\r\nDid you have anybody in your family, that was in the military? \r\n\r\nUhhh uh. My dad was a sheriff's officer for like 28 years, and I probably had a lot to do with it because he, like I saw how much he helped other people. I knew that was part of something I wanted to do. I would like to help people and might do something greater than just ourselves. \r\n\r\nSome idea of service. And you can't remember when you were exposed or got the idea of SEALs but it really became urgent two years into college. What was that sense of urgency? \r\n\r\nI don't even, I think, it was along the time, when like all the books and movies and everything were coming out. And I think I watched Lone Survivor one day or something and I decided to read the book. And that led me into reading like quite a few different books, kind of like researching it more. And I was not really a big reader. And when I started reading more and like, learnin' more, I was like, \"Wow. I'm actually interested in this.\" So that's what kind of sparked it. As I'll learned more, I just got more like into it. And I was like, \"I want to do this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So tell me about your childhood, especially interested in your parents parenting styles. So like were you spanked as a kid? \r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nFree range parenting, or...\r\n\r\nUh, it was kinda, I was spanked as a kid, but my mom and my dad really had different styles. My mom was like definitely very strict growing up. And Dad was more like, like good buddy. Like mentor. Like me. We hunted all the time together, played baseball. He coached a lot.... But he never, he was never like on my case but as much as a mom. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then as you got older, was there like, loss of privileges? Did they take away your video games, your phone, or your car? Or was it like, \"You disappointed us\"? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. It was more like the disappointment speech. I never, I don't really think I had things taken away. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: And then did you move throughout your childhood or your teenage years? \r\n\r\nWell, like being in the same area. We moved, of course, like our parents divorced and then they both remarried. And later on, they moved and moved away from like where my original house. But we still- were in the same community. I never moved away.\r\n\r\nSo you were in the same school?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: OK. So tell me about your teenage years. Did you do any sports, or do an activity with a close-knit community?\r\n\r\nWe- I play baseball growing up, from like, I started when I was like four. And then when I was eight, we had to travel team that I played with until like pretty much high school, played high school baseball. And that I definitely got that \"team\"- I was always used to being on a team and had a close knit group of guys that were always there that definitely like, was part of the reason I want to come here just like that team and knowing you can count on the dudes. \r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nSIO: So in the five years prior to BUD/S, you had the two years and then that was right out of highschool, and was there once and was there any time you were working, or. doing a gap year, or mission work? \r\n\r\nYeah. So like I worked in the summer, but then after college, after I left college, I spent at a year just working and like working out gettin ready to do it here. \r\n\r\nAnd how long was that? \r\n\r\nLike right at a year. \r\n\r\nOne year at home preparing to start training. And that was mostly physical training? Or did you have any other, sort of mental training? \r\n\r\nNah,  It was mainly just physical training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok, Would you consider yourself impulsive? For example, do you have any tattoos you got on a whim? \r\n\r\nI don't. [chuckles]. \r\n\r\n[Laughs] OK. So any. tickets, big purchases? \r\n\r\nNot really. \r\n\r\nYou didn't see a car and buy it on the spot?\r\n\r\nNah. \r\n\r\nSo you're more analytical in your decision making. You plan your research?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging time of BUD/S? This could be like an event, or evolution, or it could be like \"logs\", or \"water\".\r\n\r\nProbably the water. Probably water just because, like, that's one thing- I like definitely swam and stuff growing up. But I didn't swim competitively. I was never like... Like I just swam for fun... and not necessarily swimming portion, but especially like underwater stuff. It's just like- I didn't have much experience with. So it was like kind of weird at first. \r\n\r\nSo that- was it scary? Was it intimidating? Why was it so hard?  \r\n\r\nI guess just my nerves. Not really scary, but like, I'm just nervous. I don't know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: OK. And then when you were about to do something in the water and you had that anxiety or nervousness about it, what got you? How did you get through that challenge? \r\n\r\nReally just stand in the moment and just kind of attacking it and, just kinda- once it, once I start anything that I'm really like. \"Stressful situation.\" I just have a way of kind of like going into like a focused mode where I was just like me doing what I need to do. And it's not- I don't like outsiders stressors kind of get in. \r\n\r\nDid you have- That sounds very internal. \r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nDid you feel supported by the group? \r\n\r\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. Like everything you do here is like everybody's gone through it with me. You guys like you're never like alone do anything here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you do any practices like physical, mental, spiritual that you used to push through those challenges? So, some guys will do a prayer, meditation, or a mantra. Some athletes will, before a game, do a physical form if you have any routine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot really, no. [Chuckles]. So I just went in to everything. \r\n\r\nSIO: OK. When you made a difficult decision during training to BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? And give me an example of a decision that you really struggled with? So, for example, like running out your classmate, to go to medical, with risk of getting hurt. \r\n\r\nProbably. So I guess talking about like running somebody out, just kinda, it's kind of like I tried to give- If we were going to run somebody out, we tried to like, from my experience and we ran anybody out of was more like-  It wasn't as, uhh.... A bunch of guys like yell at people and stuff like that. We never we never really, like, told the guy to get out or just kind of try to be nice to him, like him in like do what you can do. Next thing you know, he's gone. And it's like it was hard, obviously, cause you're like basically running  the guy out, like, grown in his dream. But in the end, this program is not for everybody. And maybe down the road he gets some better shape and comes back and makes it. But if this program was like just uh... like get guys who weren't ready or something like that, then it wouldn't be what it is. I don't know. I guess that's, I kind of didn't really answer your question. \r\n\r\nSo what I'm hearing you say is that there are standards? And that it's not really that you're making a judgment and but that you're just like, \"these are the standards, and they're there for a reason.\"\r\n\r\nYeah. And everyone's expected uphold them. So if I was not meeting the standard to help him, it's kind of counterintuitive, to the whole program. \r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think that you were successful? \r\n\r\nI think just like not letting it get to you, just taking it one step at a time, like I got rolled that was like probably one of the bigger setbacks I've had at BUD/S, but was like the first time I got rolled. No one like you have to go all the way back through it. This, like, you just can't, you can't get overwhelmed by the whole process, you just got to live in a moment, you kinda get done what you got to get done at the time. \r\n\r\nSo did you notice anything about whats different about those who didn't make it, and those who dropped? \r\n\r\nUmm... It felt like they got in their own head mostly. Kind of like I was saying, like I got ahead of theirself thinking like, wow, this sucks. We got this and I still got to do this. They're not- they weren't focused on like living at the moment. Just getting through the evolution at hand. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSIO: Has this experience changed you as a person? \r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I've definitely grown- facing adversity is like the way- I feel like once you make through this, you don't. Nothing really seems quite as big of an issue to you as it would be like before I went through this. So, like, if you gave me a really big problem, I'd be like, I don't I don't know what to do. But like I this program really teaches you to use your resources, do everything you can and kinda, like, attack any issue you have to attack. \r\n\r\nProblem solving?\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\nOK. Is there any question that we haven't covered that you think would be useful for this idea of investigating who is successful and why?\r\n\r\nUmmm not really. \r\n\r\nOK. I'm going to hit stop.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Gordon Livermore\r\n\r\nDate: 23AUG20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 345 (345_ 2020.02.10_08.47_01.MP3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:31\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Alex Dietrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then I\u2019ll just confirm with you it\u2019s ok if we record?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nGreat and then would you uh state your participant ID number?\r\n\r\n345\r\n\r\nOk great uh so when did you start your BUDS class?\r\n\r\nUh 334\r\n\r\nAnd uh so you hold \r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n(Unintelligible) or is this the same class you started in\r\n\r\nNo I-I started with 334 now I\u2019m in 339\r\n\r\nOk so um has this this BUDS experience been your only BUDS experience? \r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): Um so can we talk about your family?

So you knew it was gonna suck before you did them\r\n\r\nYup\r\n\r\nBut you got through them, what was it that..?\r\n\r\nI just knew that um if I just stopped doing logs (unintelligible) that would be like I quit and I knew I wasn\u2019t going to quit um uh something uh one of my friends who was a team guy uh said to me before I came out here, we had lunch, uh he\u2019s like no matter how much it sucks or how much it hurts just know like in the end it\u2019s all worth it, so I kinda just kept that in mind um just kinda dealt with the pain then again I also just looked out for the other guys in the boat crew\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nAnd that helped\r\n\r\nSo you had sort of this internal perspective of pain is temporary \r\n\r\nYup definitely\r\n\r\nOk and then you had an external these guys are depending on me \r\n\r\nYea yea\r\n\r\nUm and then uh not wanting to let the group down I guess\r\n\r\nBig time yea \r\n\r\nAnd then so that\u2019s you not wanting to disappoint them or let them down, did you feel supported by them?\r\n\r\nUh this uh a lot of guys definitely, I-I\u2019ve been under a log or a boat with a lot of great guys um but I\u2019ve also had really some turds\r\n\r\nYea\r\n\r\nUm \r\n\r\nSo you\u2019d say that most of this motivation really came from the internal source\r\n\r\nYea I\u2019d say so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Ok did you have any practices (physical, mental, spiritual)that you used to push through the challenges? So some guys say they have a prayer or a mantra or or a visualization exercise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYea uh this was during hell week it really came out it was kinda like our class thing um sorry if I swear\r\n\r\nYea \r\n\r\nAlright uh it was just I have this video from our hell week um one of the instructors took of us just crawling around in the water on like Thursday morning uh chanting \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fucking matter\u201d so it was like our thing was like it doesn\u2019t matter what you do to us or like how much it sucks, I-I\u2019m not going anywhere\r\n\r\nYea ok so this was sort of a group mantra \r\n\r\nYea a little bit\r\n\r\nThat developed\u2026.uh \u201cit doesn\u2019t fucking matter\u201d mhm..(unintelligible) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So when you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? And is there a decision you really struggled with? So for example running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate were you ever confronted with like a hard choice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*pause* I don\u2019t think so..I...think the only hard choice would be quitting and I wasn\u2019t ever going to do that\r\n\r\nOk \r\n\r\nUm\r\n\r\nWhat about like evals (unintelligible)?\r\n\r\nUm yea I mean that was never fun um but I I don\u2019t think I ever wrote down anything I wouldn\u2019t say to that person\u2019s face um so it wasn\u2019t really a hard decision um I don\u2019t know maybe going to medical when I was screwed up cause I was really worried about getting rolled or dropped um but I know I couldn\u2019t really continue...that sucked \r\n\r\nSo what helped you go-actually go, you went?\r\n\r\nYea um just uh talking to the other guys and uh seeing what they thought, get a lot of different opinions um and uh just kinda in-the-and doing what I do and what I had to do (unintelligible)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in getting as far as you did?\r\n\r\nUm think I-I think I had a really good friend group um a lot of close friends here uh then family uh yea family friends I just I knew if I-I didn\u2019t go all the way, I\u2019d just disappoint them and I didn\u2019t want to do that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Yea ok what about those that didn\u2019t make it? What was it in them that failed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019m not sure I-I think there\u2019s hundreds of different reasons like some of the fleet returnees that were getting out in a few months um they had that option um I don\u2019t know I didn-I didn\u2019t have a plan B to this and that was that was very intentional\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nUm I didn\u2019t want to have an alternative cause some guys, there was some dude who had like a Masters um i don\u2019t know uh\r\n\r\nSomething to pursue\r\n\r\nYes something crazy and he uh he quit cause he had a backup plan um he knew he'd be fine if he didn\u2019t make it um\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019d say they weren\u2019t all in?\r\n\r\nYea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - Ok, has this experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYea definitely \r\n\r\nOh\r\n\r\nYea uh I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s made me a harder person or a softer person um\r\n\r\nHuh\r\n\r\nBut it-I definitely don\u2019t really like the ocean as much as I used to um\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nAnd I think um it's definitely made me mo-more confident in I guess my abilities just you  know and I can go through a lot of..shit\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\nCome out the other end ok\r\n\r\nConfidence ok is there anything else that I haven\u2019t asked about that you think is relative to this discussion of um.. Mental grit, heartiness, resilience, mindfulness\u2026\r\n\r\nNo I-I don\u2019t think so (unintelligible)\r\n\r\nOk so I\u2019ll hit stop...stop\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Robert Briggs\t\r\n\r\nDate: 10AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: Not Specified (2020.03.04_04.58_01.mp3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 17:09\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so I have a series of questions that are somewhat open ended, but somewhat closed, so it should be pretty easy to answer them. Uh, We got about 15 minutes, so uh \r\n\r\nOkay\r\n\r\n...hopefully we can make it all the way through.\r\n\r\nYa\r\n\r\nUh, so when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\n2008\r\n\r\n2008?\r\n\r\nYes, ...I\u2026 my first attempt.\r\n\r\nUh, so this is not your first?\r\n\r\nNo this is my second time through. \r\n\r\nWhen did you start this attempt?\r\n\r\nThis one was in February, sorry uh, August of 2018\r\n\r\nAugust of 2018?\r\n\r\nUh, 2019. \r\n\r\nOh, 2019? So did you start with 339?\r\n\r\nUh, 338. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): Okay, uhm, How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have a sister.\r\n\r\nA sister? Younger or older?\r\n\r\nYounger\r\n\r\nWhat was your parental situation growing up?\r\n\r\nUhm, mother, a biological mother and then a ,uh, stepfather who adopted us. \r\n\r\nSo were your parents, your biological parents, married? Divorced?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nNo they, uh, they never wedded.\r\n\r\nWhat was your relationship, so do you have a relationship with both your mother and biological father?\r\n\r\nYes, I didn\u2019t meet my biological father until I was 25.\r\n\r\n How is your relationship with your mom?\r\n\r\nGreat\r\n\r\nLet me go back to this first question. So you started your first BUD/s Class was 2008 and this is your second? Or have you done...had other\r\n\r\nTechnically would 338 and 339 be two separate ones? \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know. So, but between so in 2008?\r\n\r\nI quit.\r\n\r\nYou quit?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nAnd then not again until last year?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019re one of the older?\r\n\r\nI am. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s got to make it tougher?\r\n\r\nIt did\r\n\r\nPhysically?\r\n\r\nAnd mentally as well (chuckles).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO what life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\nSo, prior to this time, I guess, inbetween, or more before the first one?\r\n\r\nUhm, either uh, either way I guess.\r\n\r\nUhm, nothing significant for the first one which is why I didn\u2019t have enough experience and I quit, and then inbetween 2008 and 2000...now, went to the fleet and did about 9 years.    \r\n\r\nAnd that just made you decide you wanted to\u2026\r\n\r\nI knew I wanted to come back, and, uh, unfortunately it was a long road so I guess that in its\u2026 trying to get here over a decade that was a major obstacle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, How did those experiences factor into, or that experience factor into your experience now?\r\n\r\nUhm, made it infinitely easier. At least on the mental side of it. Physically the time, you know, it\u2019s a little more difficult. \r\n\r\nYeah, I think , I could, I could have done this when I was twenty I don\u2019t know, no way I could do it at my age now. Or maybe not even at 25.\r\n\r\nYou never know, you could talk to a navy recruiter. \r\n\r\nOh, I\u2019m former army.\r\n\r\nThank you for your service, by the way.\r\n\r\nThank you for yours. I uh, If I had known all the things about the Navy I know now, I probably would have joined the navy. A lot more exciting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhm, How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a hard worker and I am a team player. And I do, I do, I am more on the introverted side but... I think that allowed me to not necessarily, maybe uh, not need as much external validation as I did when I was younger. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community and so what made you want to do it, and some of the examples they have here are do you have any SEALs as family or friends or do you have any military family or friends? \r\n\r\nHmm, My father was British SAS. \r\n\r\nbiological father?\r\n\r\nStepfather\r\n\r\nStepfather?\r\n\r\nYeah...and uh that introverted side of me has always, I\u2019ve always longed for a community. \r\n\r\nAre you enlisted or officer?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Enlisted\r\n\r\nEnlisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, Tell me a little bit about your childhood.  So were you, specifically, how were you disciplined as a child? Like spanking, grounding? \r\n\r\nYes, physically.\r\n\r\nPhysically?\r\n\r\nYes...I\u2019m glad I was. \r\n\r\nI am too. Of course not at the time thought. \r\n\r\nOh of course, absolutely\r\n\r\nWere you anything else, like timeouts or things taken away?\r\n\r\nYes, absolutely everything...everyway under the sun. They did a good job of it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move a lot?Uhm During your childhood or teen years?\r\n\r\nI would say yes, mainly because most people have one or two places, but I have like five or six. \r\n\r\nLike in the same area or a series?\r\n\r\nI would say the same area, like cities bordering the same city. \r\n\r\nSo it wasn\u2019t like moving from Japan to Germany to Mexico to Canada to\u2026\r\n\r\nNo, no yeah it was yeah it was the relative same place you sleep.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  So when you were a teenager, Did you participate in team sports or other activities.\r\n\r\nI did, I did. Uh Soccer...Football...baseball...then I did some individual, oh waterpolo as well for team. And Then I did swimming\r\n\r\nAny other kind of team activities?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/s? You\u2019ve been out in the fleet?\r\n\r\nYeah, I was in the civilian sector for a little bit of it as well, break in service. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry...oh a break in service?\r\n\r\nYeah, I had a two year break in service.\r\n\r\nSo, did you so you were in the navy you had a break in service and then did you come back in specifically to do this?\r\n\r\nYes \r\n\r\nSo you\u2019ve been back in for like a year\r\n\r\nYeah this this active duty time here, yes\r\n\r\nWhat did uhm, what did you do during your break in service?\r\n\r\nI went to school full time and I did a multitude of customer service jobs including personal training. \r\n\r\nDid you finish your degree?\r\n\r\nI did not, no\r\n\r\nWhat were you working on?\r\n\r\nUhm a bachelors in kinesiology. \r\n\r\n Would you consider yourself impulsive?  \r\n\r\nNo...Not anymore. I was when I was young. \r\n\r\nSIO: Do you have any Tattoos?\r\n\r\nI do not, I do not.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s supposed to be an example of impulsivity. I think maybe historically, maybe it was.\r\n\r\nI can see why.\r\n\r\nYeah I just I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think of it that way now. \r\n\r\nRight yeah\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s more of a everybody does it seemingly. \r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Hardest day, hardest event? \r\n\r\nDoes it have to be a specific event or a day or can it be just like a theme.\r\n\r\nIt can just be in general.\r\n\r\nUhm, the hardest part was being, having to realize being who you thought you were...you\u2019re not. You\u2019re gonna have to work all the time on that so having to kind of self reflect, you know, realize your short comings and grow from those experiences are what makes you.\r\n\r\nSo would you say like that you\u2019re not going to succeed at everything?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. \r\n\r\nAnd I think that\u2019s what I hear you saying, I think.\r\n\r\nYes, yeah.\r\n\r\nRecognizing you are going to fail.\r\n\r\nYeah and in ways you don\u2019t expect, I mean you can anticipate I mean for me, 10 years, I thought long and hard about this every single day and I expected some failures and those didn\u2019t bother me but I didn\u2019t expect the failures during the less difficult parts of BUD/s.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated to push through? \r\n\r\nDesperation. I desperately wanted to be here, I was going to do anything it took to stay\r\n\r\nDid you feel that you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\nYes, up until the last month, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What practices (physical, mental, spiritual) did you utilize to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nI had a very good support system. \t\r\n\r\nBut not like, uhh, prayer or meditation or anything?\r\n\r\nNo, I would\u2026 I\u2019m (unintelligible) I guess you could say I, I\u2019m, I believe a man if you want to be a good person you have to be a man of your word. If you make a commitment you stick to it. So I guess in a way that was my spiritual thing the way I perceived it.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Is there a specific decision you struggled with at BUD/S and the examples they give are, they\u2019re listed here, are you know deciding to run a classmate out, or turn in someone who\u2019s cheating\r\n\r\nYeah, so more applicable to the latter, uhm, calling people out for not contributing, I would say that my father always told me that bad things happen when good men stand by and do nothing. So I guess, always being honest uhm, even, even when um I may want to go along with it uhm, doing the right thing when no one is looking, doing the right thing even\u2026\r\n\r\nEven when what?\r\n\r\nEven when it might be the more difficult route, understanding it was for the better. \r\n\r\nSIO: Is there a particular example of turning someone in? Is that you want to share, or?\r\n\r\nJust not being afraid call your, your brothers out to make sure they are all on the same standard as everybody else. That\u2019s a difficult one to surmise. \r\n\r\nHuh?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a difficult one to surmise on paper. \r\n\r\nOh, I\u2019m sure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUhm, \u2018cause I always follow through with my commitments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about the people that did not make it?  Something different between the folks that were going to make it and those that didn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person? If it did\r\n\r\nI am less confident than I was before\r\n\r\nLess confident?\r\n\r\nYeah...that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. \r\n\r\n(chuckles) No. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I, that I should have asked you? That helped you or hurt you or that I didn\u2019t ask you. \r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nWell that\u2019s it \r\n\r\nAwesome, thank you. \r\n\r\nThank you, and uhm...\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jonathan Savage \t\r\n\r\nDate: 11AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: Not specified (2020.03.04_03.23_01)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: \r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so I am going to ask you a series of questions. We got 15 minutes to get through, so, umm, so it shouldn\u2019t be too terribly long. Umm, When did you start your BUDS Class? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarted 37, that was \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass 337\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, that was last year in, February\u2026 Last year I think it was. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary of 2019? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this, this is, this is not your first, uhh, oir is it your first BUDS experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, yeah, it is my first BUDS experience. I got rolled twice. Umm, now I am in 339.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): Okay, uhm, How many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have 1 younger brother. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, it\u2019s you and a brother?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was your parental situation growing up? \r\n\r\nUhh, my mom and my dad got divorced, uhh, around, when I was like 5 years old. They got divorced, and pretty much, after that, I grew up just with my mom. And my dad used to like travel alot. He wasn\u2019t very present as physical, but he was like - like called a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo he called regularly? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was your relationship like with both of them? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, my mom was very close, she was pretty much like my mom and my dad at the same time since my dad wasn\u2019t there that much. But with my dad, it wasn\u2019t as close as with my mom, but it was a good relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: SO what life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say my mom and dad getting divorced would be one. Umm, I don\u2019t know. I am having to think about it. Uhh, I mean, I didn\u2019t grow up here in the US. I grew up in Columbia. So, I -growing up I got to see US and Columbia both because I\u2019d travel back and forth. So I think that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, How did those experiences factor into, or that experience factor into your experience now?\r\n\r\nI think like in the type of people that you meet. You get to appreciate the difference in people. Like, everybody\u2019s different and just because their different doesn\u2019t mean, I don\u2019t know, just \u2026 I\u2019ll say you just get to learn a lot about different people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uhm, How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUhh, I would consider myself a very quiet person. I think that that helps a lot here because sometimes leadership is trying to put out word and their are other people talking and saying stuff and it is just sound pollution. So, I think that that helped a lot. Also, I am a very person - I listen a lot. There is definitely a lot of attention to detail here, so I guess that helps a lot too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, Describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community and so what made you want to do it, and some of the examples they have here are do you have any SEALs as family or friends or do you have any military family or friends? \r\n\r\nYeah, so prior Navy, I did not know any Navy SEALs and the way I got like learn about this community was pretty much, so I was born here in San Diego or you see little camp down by the strand by those motor homes down there. I used to see the BUDs classes down the beach and that really got me interested. So, I grew up and started learning more and decided thats what I want to do. I didn\u2019t want to do the same things my friends were doing, like finish high school and go to college. You know I wanted to do something else, something different. \r\n\r\nSIO: So, Tell me a little bit about your childhood.  So were you, specifically, how were you disciplined as a child? Like spanking, grounding? \r\n\r\nUhh, I mean my mom was great. She was like, she was definitely very strict, but she was also very nice and kind and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you get spanked? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, early\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEary? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hardly remember a time I got spanked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you got grounded? Timeouts? Things taken away? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, yeah she was like, like - I like a lot of sports, so if I got a bad grade, she might take sports away from me. Something like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move a lot?Uhm During your childhood or teen years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, yes, pretty much back and forth between the States and Columbia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this area? San Diego and Columbia? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Diego, Yes. So I went to school there, but I spent all of my vacations here.  Summer, Christmas, all spent here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  So when you were a teenager, Did you participate in team sports or other activities.\r\n\r\nUhh, yes, I played for my soccer team, my volleyball team, and my basketball team in high school. And, I was into boxing and martial arts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Martial Arts? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, yeah\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/s? \r\n\r\nHigh school pretty much. I finished high school and came here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you went from high school to enlisted in the Navy and came\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes and came here to BUDS. I finished high school in 2018. 2018, I came here to San Diego and probably lasted like two months working out and then joined the Navy and came here to BUDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you consider yourself impulsive? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not consider myself impulsive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe example in the question they ask is do you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the only one I have. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there is some literature that suggest that having tattoos is a sign of impulsivity. Probably dated, but uhh, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to read that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMehh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivates you on a daily basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? (Holistic question) (Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S)\r\n\r\nUhh, I wouldn\u2019t say its a day. Its like a week. I would say it would definitely be first phase. Its just like you\u2019re super tired, you\u2019re hurt, yeah, you\u2019re drained, but you \u2026 and you have these test like physical evolutions like runs and swims. You start thinking you might not be able to make it and your like scared about getting performanced dropped. Especially when you\u2019re hurt and injured. Having to do those things while you\u2019re hurt and injured, I mean, you might not be able to perform. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What motivated to push through?  Did you feel like you were supported by the group?\r\n\r\nUhh, I think like all the training and like me leaving Columbia and coming here because I knew I wanted to do this, I was just not going to let that be for nothing. Yeah, I was just not going to let me family down and myself down. And I was already here so, I was like this is my only option so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What practices (physical, mental, spiritual) did you utilize to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nUhh, self talk, you see you have that voice in my head that would tell me that I have like a little more. I would have things in my head that would make me feel happy. I would think a lot about my brother and my mom. Yeah, thats it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision?\r\n\r\nWhat decision did you really struggle with? \r\n\r\nHmm, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe example that they give here is turning in a cheating classmate for example. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, yeah something in hell week. We were running boat and one guy was definitely not performing. He was not keeping up with us and it was either we slow down and have in in our boat and not perform or performing and eventually knowing that he would not be able to keep up with us and that he would get dropped. He definitely wasn\u2019t one of the good guys in our class, so we decided as a crew that we were going to run him out. So we just sped up and he eventually ended up falling out. I\u2019d say that was a hard decision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what went through your mind when you made that decision? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh, I was thinking like was it the right thing to do. Maybe we should have slowed down and let him keep the pace or was him performing a good thing to do by making us not perform. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think a lot has to be with the people that you met here and the relationships that you make. They definitely help a lot. And like I said before, I felt like I left behind me like a lot of stuff to come here and I was not going to let that be for nothing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you notice anything different about those that did not make it?  If so, can you describe those differences?\r\n\r\nYes, they were very, like before coming here, when we were at great lakes, they were very cocky, talk a lot, or be like oh yeah, I am an amazing guy. Yeah, they were pretty cocky, no humility. Uhh, immature. Yeah, I think those are the two big things I noticed, Cocky and immature. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: BONUS QUESTION - How did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nUhh, it definitely showed me that you can definitely like you and your mind can just do a lot of things. You might not be the fastest or strongest dude, but if you really think you can do it, you can. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh is there anything else that I should have asked you that helped you or hurt you through BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, I think that is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, we\u2019re done.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: James Velten\r\n\r\nDate: 11August2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 351\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 16:22\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is participant number 351. So I\u2019ve just got a series of questions and... we should be able to get through all of them - we\u2019ve got 15 minutes, um ya know give or take a minute or so. Um when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh, I want to say June last year, uh June July area. Came in February. \r\n\r\nIs this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\nYep, yes.\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nOne younger sister.\r\n\r\nWhat is your uh, what was your parental situation growing up?\r\n\r\nUh my parental situation? Um, my parents were together until I was about 17 years old and then divorced. Um...Very civil. There was no uh big situation, not even child support or anything. Just parted ways.\r\n\r\nSo it was amicable?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your relationship like with your mom and dad?\r\n\r\nUh..like, like I said - very civil. I visit both of them regularly. They\u2019ll be around each other regularly. So, it\u2019s - they\u2019re very good. Very, um, probably consider my relationship with my dad a little more like a buddy, but very respectable, at least I\u2019d say normal.\r\n\r\nWhat life-changing events um happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm.. yeah, nothing crazy. Especially involving me coming to BUD/S. No, nothing.\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say uh well I\u2019ve always kindof considered myself a little bit of an agreeable person, so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA what?\r\n\r\nAn Agreeable - person.\r\n\r\nAgreeable?\r\n\r\nYeah, uh. I definitely uh. That kind of makes it really easy to get along with a lot of people. When you have a bunch of different personalities and you\u2019re. But um, I\u2019d say that\u2019s been in my favor. No authority issues, have an easy time following orders. Take charge when I need to.\r\n\r\nSo, describe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community and in particular, the question is, do you have any SEALs as family or friends, do you have any military family or friends in general? \r\n\r\nOkay Umm. I do have military family. Not immediate family, uh, my grand-dad was in the Marines, but that\u2019s, that\u2019s about it. No close relatives. No military. Uh, prior to going to BUD/S I did landscaping growing up and construction, and uh I found out that I didn\u2019t really find, see myself pursuing anything like that. Looked around, didn\u2019t know the military was an option, uh really, didn\u2019t consider it until later. And uh, jumped on that pretty quick. Found out about the BUD/S pipeline, SEAL teams. Jumped on that about as fast as I could.\r\n\r\nAnd how did you hear about their, how\u2019d you find out about the SEALS? \r\n\r\nUm I guess, movies. I mean they\u2019re pretty popular. It\u2019s kinda, it\u2019s kinda easy to pick up the name. Um I went to talk to the recruiter - I was originally going to go Marines. But, the recruiter. I accidentally walked into a Navy command. He told me about the SEAL teams and everything. So, I liked the idea of that a lot more than the Marines. \r\n\r\nSo tell me a little bit about your uh childhood - so, in particular, how were you disciplined as a child? Were you spanked? Were you grounded? \r\n\r\nNot nearly as much as I probably should have been. Um, yeah, I was - I was spanked. My dad had the sound of him opening his closet with the belt hanging. It always kinda, make a noise. The whip of the belt coming out. But probably didn\u2019t get my butt beat nearly as much as I should have. \r\n\r\nDid you move around uh as a child? Teenager?\r\n\r\nNo, no.\r\n\r\nDid you in high school participate in team sports?\r\n\r\nUh, no, I played as a young kid - I got into music when I got in high school and I had to start working. So, no. \r\n\r\nSo, you did music in high school? \r\n\r\nYeah, yeah I didn\u2019t play in the school band or anything. I got in a garage band with a bunch of my buddies. I played guitar since I was younger. But that was sort of where a lot of my interest went.\r\n\r\nAnd then you started working? \r\n\r\nYeah, yessir - I worked since I was a little kid. Um I did landscaping with my dad; worked at the grocery store; went and did construction. \r\n\r\nFraming? \r\n\r\nUh, it was more demolition. So I started with demolition and then I would help rebuild the house too.\r\n\r\nSo destruction?\r\n\r\nSay again.\r\n\r\nDestruction?\r\n\r\nIt was, it was a big mixture. So it was disaster restoration. We\u2019d come in and mow the house out, and then rebuild it. So we did some framing, um I helped a lot with drywall, a lot of interior work.\r\n\r\nSo what have you done in the last five years before coming to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nUh construction area.\r\n\r\nSo did you, did you graduate high school and go? \r\n\r\nUh, yes. I graduated high school in 2014. And then I tried college, wasn\u2019t much for it - couldn\u2019t really find an interest of my own. I do plan on going. Um, yeah that was about it, working, gave the college route a shot, find my way in there.\r\n\r\nSo you, some college, you\u2019re working, you joined the Navy?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHow long have you been in the Navy?\r\n\r\nOne year this year. \r\n\r\nSo you joined the Navy specifically to come to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nYeah, bootcamp straight to here.\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n...No.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be measuring the delay it takes for people to answer that question. \r\n\r\nOkay, sorry. \r\n\r\nNo, I\u2019m saying - the irony would be, if you took a long time to say yes.\r\n\r\nOkay, right.\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s an example of impulsivity, apparently. \r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nSo, what was the most challenging component in BUD/S? Uh Either in a day or an event. \r\n\r\nUm, well one of the biggest things that was a shock to me was like the kind of people here. Not even so much an event, but really just trying to keep with these guys. Like, like I said, I didn\u2019t play sports in high school. So I might have been a little bit on the lesser spectrum of godly athlete. But um, trying to keep up with them was fairly difficult. And the mind and physical. Yeah, you got the hard chargers. That definitely. Super professional, everyone shows up on time. That wasn\u2019t something I was used to. But um, yeah. I was going to say a specific evolution, but can\u2019t think of anything else.\r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\nUm same thing, um you kind of look around while you\u2019re getting cold and wet, and running with that boat on your head. You look around and kinda see everyone else suffering too, it takes you out of your own head kinda. \r\n\r\nDid you feel like group support was important?  \r\n\r\nFor sure.\r\n\r\nSo what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, did you use to push through? \r\n\r\nWell I don\u2019t know if you know about our Masterchief Magorachi, with his stuff, the visualization, and the um, that was probably a big thing when it came to doing stuff like OC8. Kinda going and getting the mental reps in your head before you go something definitely helped a lot, that for sure a big thing. Um, following the breathing they gave us. Really everything he briefed us on - I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with it. It\u2019s very uh, it\u2019s - I definitely encourage it. \r\n\r\nWhat is it in particular? I mean, what kind of..\r\n\r\nSo, he gives these - it\u2019s based off of say uh three of four little principles - visualization, arousal control, um it just involves controlling your breathing, how excited you\u2019re getting, stuff like that. To be honest, I can\u2019t bring up in my head right now. But, he kind of precedes all of BUD/S with this big brief; he talks about everything, it\u2019s pretty interesting. Just stuff along that matter, I can\u2019t remember the rest of the acronym. I\u2019d say the visualization and everything.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the, what is the acronym?  \r\n\r\nV-A-G-S. Vags. But it\u2019s, it\u2019s very good stuff - very intelligent. \r\n\r\nSo when you made a difficult decision during BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made the decision? So what decision did you really struggle with and in particular, the examples that are listed here are: running classmates out or turning in someone who\u2019s cheating, anything like that.\r\n\r\nWell, you absolutely don\u2019t want to do that. But at the same time, you don\u2019t want to do that at the beginning. Now, you\u2019re looking around the room and like realizing you\u2019re going to work with these guys, I realized that kind of early on, run out of boat in BUD/S, unfortunately now you got out. Um, I don\u2019t know if that answers the question much, but.\r\n\r\nWell, so I guess the question is really about - did you have to make such a decision, and when you made that decision what went through your mind?\r\n\r\nUh, yes. Just we all signed up for it. It\u2019s part of the process. Um, they used to say, ya know not everyone is a good team guy, some people are just good neighbors. \r\n\r\nGood what? \r\n\r\nGood neighbors. They\u2019re better neighbors than they are team guys. That\u2019s kind of what I always thought about - if you\u2019re meant to make it through the program, you\u2019ll find a way through it.\r\n\r\nDo you have a specific example?\r\n\r\nUh, being underneath the boat is a pretty good example. Um again, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s your extent of knowledge is on what we\u2019re doing, but in first phase we run with the boat on our head, and that\u2019s when you run people out, because if you fall out then that\u2019s technically a DOR or a quit. So yeah, multiple times it stinks, because everyone is passionate about it. \r\n\r\nSo, that\u2019s when the boat is upside down on your head and you\u2019re?\r\n\r\nThe inflatable boat. There\u2019s seven of us in a boat crew. And uh, you\u2019re running to and from whatever evolution or for the evolution you\u2019re running with the boat on your head. And if you don\u2019t keep up with your classmates, then you get exhausted and fall out, or they pull you out, just depending. Um, yeah I mean I\u2019m not going to stop to let him catch up - that makes the rest of the boat get dropped. I\u2019m trying to say that without sounding extremely arrogant. But, no no you don\u2019t want them to see everybody stopping.\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI would say um\u2026 definitely the mental game. Um a lot of time, we really think, think things suck, but you take a look around and see everyone else succeeding. Definitely helps. Same thing as earlier. It\u2019s a group mentality. That would probably be my biggest one. Like I said, I did do construction and landscaping, that was good, fun, tough work - probably made me a little bit more used to the grind if...\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different about the people who didn\u2019t make it? Any specific characteristics? \r\n\r\nA lot less confidence in themselves. Um, yeah, yeah for sure. They uh - we always kind of joked around that you could see it on people, but um it\u2019s really hard to call someone on whether they\u2019re going to make it, because they may surprise you. Um, but yeah, confidence was a big thing. Especially when you\u2019re about to quit. Um, nothing else.\r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person, if it did?\r\n\r\nDefinitely more mature, and definitely know a lot more about myself. I look for kind of professional little traits that I didn\u2019t look at before. Maybe a little bit more judgemental - the standards are a little bit different here than other places. But, definitely my confidence is through the roof now. \r\n\r\nIs there anything else that uh, I should have asked you that I didn\u2019t, or that helped or hurt you in BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI just hope they keep it the way it should be, the standards shouldn\u2019t be lowered. It should stay the way it is, if not keep getting harder.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: LOFTUS\r\n\r\nDate: 19 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 352\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 12:49\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright so I'm here with uh partici\u2026  participant number 352. Time is 0732 on 10 Feb. This is Commander Ledford. And uh we are doing the interview. Do you consent to be interviewed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright awesome. So some warmup questions just to kind of get you started. Uh how many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll younger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, what are there ages?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh one of them is 22, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh male or female?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMale. 22 year old brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19 year old brother. So male 19, and then female 16. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh what were your male brothers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNice. and your age is?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24 so I\u2019m the oldest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then uh your parental situation growing up. Are your parents married or divorced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are still married now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSame parents yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got your birth order and siblings uh and how was your relationship with your parents? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery good like extremely strong relationship with both parents, still today. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong. So prior to BUD/S uh what life changing events do feel like if you were looking at the span of your life what events were like some major ones that probably shaped you in some way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell growing up I played a lot of baseball you know I always wanted to be a big baseball player but uh I had shoulder surgery in highschool uh and uh after that another like finger surgery uh it kinda limited my physical ability so I had to learn how to commission it back like playing with a hurt shoulder when I wasnt supposed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen did that happen, the shoulder surgery?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was uh Junior to Senior summer in Highschool. That was like the big recruiting season so like once that happened I kind of realized that baseball might not be my thing and I had been thinking about this for a long time and that kind of i guess directed me this way I think thats one of the bigger ones like huge life changing events I cant really think of any bigger ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo pushing through that injury?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean that that was one thing that really taught me to play through pain i guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I guess it showed me I could do a lot more than I thought before i guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how did that kind of factor into your experience at BUD/S? Like uh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I learned how to push through pain I was told not to play baseball for a year but I was very stubborn and I started playing within three months after having surgery so I learned what I was capable of I dont know more than I previously thought as a teenager that kind of deal. So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweet. What do you think about your personality that contributes towards your sucsess at buds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess I kind of have like a very serious personality um I found more serious than a lot of the guys in the class honestly very disciplined and focused um so I was able to latch onto the goal for a long time without really having much else to distract me i guess thats probably a trait that helped me I suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo uh going back to your background did you have any seal friends or family? Do you have a military family?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dad just got out of the navy he was a surface warfare officer for thirty years. So uh he always i guess kind of inspired me to do the whole military thing even though he didnt push me towards it at all and then just kind of by chance I read a book that interested me about seals and I guess directed me this way so \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo going into a little bit about your childhood uh how were disciplined were you like did your parents put you in timeout did they spank you uh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIguess \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithholding toys?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pretty standard like timeouts they never spanked me at all uh when I was a teenager standard groundings like no phone no going out with friends for a week pretty standard nothing too profound I dont think they were very uh they were very quick iguess to lay down the hammer with regards to i guess mild discipline like I couldnt really get away with a whole lot which I guess was pretty good in the long run so kept me on a straightened arrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot or all the time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI moved eighteen times before I moved out of the house so i think at least once or twice a year so it came in waves so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo about your teenage years what about uh your participation with uh team sports were you in any tightknit communities \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust baseball yeah I was always playing baseball year round down near southerncalifornia so always on some kind of team and it was just strictly baseball since it was all I cared about at the time so \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then in the last five years before you came to buds, what were you doing in those five years before you came to buds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I played college baseball at a small community college for a couple years and actually I came to buds with class 321 and dored out of that class and spent a couple years in the fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo first you went small community college\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall community college  and played baseball\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you did that for two years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes two years uh then I at that point I enlisted with class 321\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass 321\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDored out of that class and I was a bostwains mate in the fleet so just a lot of painting and then I came back\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long did you spend in the fleet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two and a half years pretty short compared to a lot of guys but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself compulsive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tNot at all uh any tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat do you think was the most challenging component at buds? Think about your  \r\n\r\n            hardest days at buds \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBasically for me the hardest \u2026 (Inteligible 7:52-8:09)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAnd what motivated you to push through it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWell I knew that I had to do it I decided this a long time ago and I knew that if I didnt \r\n\r\n            pass it and if i did drop that my life direction would be non existent (inteligible  \r\n\r\n            8:26-8:30)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey guys can you try and keep it down a little bit ok for the interviews? Please thanks Uh\r\n\r\n            um what what practices do you have any practices that helped you especially during the challenging phases of buds so peaceful practices mental practices spiritual daily practices \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA lot of in the moment ones its kind of like the very stereotypical box breathing that definitely helped like in the moment like on the pool deck before pool comp to calm me down um and then just like a lot of reflection like at the end of the day I really I really would think about the reasons for being here and be like yeah this is sometimes terrible sometimes not and I just kinda reflect the long time it took to get here the first time and get back the second time and be like well theres no other option so i guess just intentionality mindedness for lack of better wording\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAnd did you find yourself doing that reflection each day? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tYes very frequently even throughout the day when things start getting low I kinda would look back at the past couple of years and remember why I was here and who I was and all that kind of stuff. Sounds like what we talked about before its the mindedness portion i think thats the biggest thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So uh when you made a difficult decision during uh BUD/S what went through your mind as you made that decision? Was there a decision that you really struggled with while you were here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cant think of like one decision in particular um I just really thought about long term consequences like if I do this now am I going to be able to live with myself in five years, ten years whats my wife going to think about that um what kind of legacy would that leave behind \u2026 (inaudible 10:15-1020)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful in BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause I decided I had to. I had made this projection for this life and the man who I wanted to be and (inaudible 10:32-10:38)  looking back to now i decided there was there was no other option so thats really it once you make that kind of commitment. Kind of game over in my opinion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different um from the guys who didnt make it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think a lot of the guys who didnt make it through were kind of here for the I guess the status, they didnt necessarily want to do the job and be the man that this requires. I never really thought too much about that though honestly, in regards to other people I kind of just you know like remained focused on my own development and tried not to judge other guys so I dont know if I have the best perspective on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did you feel like this changed you as a person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIve uh yeah Ive grown a lot ive matured a lot I feel like ive aged significantly from coming here and then trying to come back and then actually making it through on the second go around (inaudible 11:36-11:40)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything that you think uh I should be asking you about what helped you or hurt you coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wouldn't even know what to begin with for those kind of questions I think these are probably a good place to start for your background checks. I guess (inaudible 11:59-12:02) more questions about mindfulness. Once you know who you are and what you want you can truly articulate that and there is nothing else that can stop you so I think mindfulness is (inaudible 12:10-12:18).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwesome. Sounds good. Alright that is all I got, Hey thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you Sir. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI really appreciate it.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Andrew Malick\r\n\r\nDate: 12AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 115 switched to 353 (115_2020.02.10_08.05_01.mp3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 16:19\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Alex Deitrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 353\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you completed the consent. And do I have your consent to record? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, great. So your number, you can tell me your number and sort of explain the situation...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy old card was 115. It was lost last time I checked in. So we switched it to 353 with the new information. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. So when did you start your BUD/s class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI came to Coronado with class 337. I was rolled out of orientation, did not class up with first phase with  337. I secured hell week with 338. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. And was this your goal, was that was your first BUD/S experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulations on making it this far. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo could we talk about your family? Do you have any siblings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have one younger brother is three years younger. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you talk about your family dynamics? Were your parents married, divorced and separated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of my parents are married? So, yeah, they have good, good relationship. They've been together my whole life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how has your relationship with them? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's good. I'll talk to them all the time still while I'm here. Growing up, would describe as the typical relationship dynamic you would expect between your parents and kids. But I've talked to them a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, any life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm proud of BUD/S yes, so I was in college and pursuing my degree earned myself a night in jail on a DUI. So that was kind of a big turning point in my life. I would say the biggest thing that happened to me, because that's when I really turned my sights from school to focusing on this actually into being suspended for a semester of college my third year because of that. And then from there, I decided to continue my education and go on to start training for this assessment. I left I didn't earn my degree. And I didn't did not finish. Yes. So I left and started training for this. And a year later, I joined the military. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. So you enlisted?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think? And if so, how do you think those experiences factored into your experiences at BUD/S? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think that just knowing that I can overcome hardships are when things were- things was a pretty dark time for me at that time, as well as really disappointing myself and continue to go on. I think that knowing that I can could overcome, you know, like change events such as that going into BUD/S. I knew that whatever they'd throw at me that I can overcome it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, knowing you could overcome adversity? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n How do you think your personality affected your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider myself a pretty amicable person. I can kind of talk with people, connect with people. So that's I think the big thing here with the emphasis on teamwork is, you know, creating good, strong relationships with people around you. So I think that was a big part of it, was being able to kind of integrate with the class full of type A, very hardheaded people. So it worked out really well and it worked. I think I became pretty clear about everyone in class. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it sounds like you're agreeable. You talked about good communication skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I believe so. I think that I can convey my thoughts and emotions to people in a direct manner, but one that, you know, people can respond to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd relationship building. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK... Would you consider yourself competitive? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Absolutely. I grew up playing sports all my life. I've played three sports all through high school and have always had that competitive drive and desire to succeed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut somehow managing to balance that with others, but also relationship building?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, absolutely. I mean, I think competition is- there's a difference between healthy competition and one where you want to be... raise your personal station and be detrimental to others. But I think competitiveness and good drive will to succeed is very important. However, having that competitiveness, you also want the people around you to succeed with you. I think that's kind of the essence of teamwork and something that's very important here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo describe anything in your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community? Did you have any SEAL mentors or is there somebody in the family or friend? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family. Family friend- I grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia. So it's you know, that's a big half of the community over there. So I'd always kind of seen them walking around and whatnot. And from a young age, you know, knowing who they were, and kinda had an idea of what they did. You know, my parents, you know, when they first told me about, say, \"you know, these guys are the ones that protect us and whatnot.\" That's kind of where it started going back my head. But when I was young enough, it sound like such an insurmountable thing. But growing up, we had a couple of family, friends who, you know, I would talk to and the people that they were I wanted to emulate. So from there, it was always kind of thought that, hey, I'm may pursue this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo tell me about your childhood. For example, you have a good relationship with your... parents? How how you disciplined? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporal punishment was a very big part of- spankings and the belt and whatnot. Yes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. There was a belt? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, there was definitely a belt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd like through what age do you think? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was probably like 10 I so would probably be the latest that was, you know, as I started to grow older, you know, that they will just treat me like an adult. And when I made mistakes, I was held accountable for those mistakes. So that was, when I got older and teenage years and what not. It was more grounding and kind of restricting my freedoms because I would say they got breached their trust or something. So because of that, my freedom would be restricted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking video games away? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI didn't play any video games, but just grounding. I couldn't go play with my friends. And, you know, yeah the car once I was able to drive is a big thing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you move around through your childhood? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I was born and raised in, Virginia Beach, the same house. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, same house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, yes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then tell me about your teenage years. You mentioned sports? Any team sports?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, yes. I played baseball, football. I swam from 9th grade on middle school as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Yes. So the school, I went to a first through twelfth grade private school. So it was you know, you were in the same building your entire your entire time in school. So middle school and high school were always more blended than it would be in, you know, typical elementary, middle, high school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling the team dynamics, sort of learning how to work on a team?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I mean, the people that I went to school with, I was pretty much with from first grade on. So, you know, very strong relations there. And so it was beneficial because we all knew each other very well going into when we played the team sports. So that was a good, good relationships built early on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this question asks about the last five years, immediately before BUD/S, I think you answered, that you had the college experience? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I did college. And then when I when I left college, I came back home and worked odd jobs. I worked in a restaurant for while. I was a server. I was I was- my summer job was a Virginia Beach lifeguard. So I did that for eight years every summer. That was a big part of a lot of physical training involved in that. And outside of that, you know, worked out a lot and then got on certain programs lifting programs and running programs. Once I had, you know, set my sights directly on my dock to BUD/S, which was about two years ago, I would say it would be a really good turning point defining moment when I started, \"I'm going to train for this.\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, great. Would you consider yourself impulsive? For example, do you have any tattoos you just got on a whim, or speeding tickets?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tattoos, I have speeding tickets. Yes. I did like to drive fast from time to time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen was the last time you had a speeding ticket?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSay, four years ago, the last time. But impulsive isn't tattoo's or making rash decisions if-. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBig purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, if it's a big purchase or something, that's going to impact me for a long period time after I make that decision, I typically am pretty thoughtful about that. I'd say that most of the mistakes I made my life were something where this was kinda younger and more than my decision making from that. But if I made a mistake, it was because of an impulse decision and because of that, I think now, as I've grown up, matured a bit, that rash decisions are fewer and further between. And I'm more thoughtful in my decision making and the whether they're negative or positive impacts the decisions have. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S? This is kind of a holistic question. So it could be a particular day or could be sort of a general- the water. You know was there something that's really been a challenge for you to overcome? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it was overall just being doubtful of... my ability to do so. You know, you're surrounded by so many incredible athletes, incredible driven people. That was kind of a thought of... You know, if you see guys quit, you thought were absolute studs and like, okay, these guys can't make it. Will I be able to? So I think that just like on a day to day basis, like, hey, you're going to get up and you're gonna do this to the best you can and whatever happens, happens. But I think this mental aspect is is by far the most challenging part physically. Everyone can do it, but mentally is where it separates who does and who succeeds and fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through? How did you get past that, \"self talk\"? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's, I think just looking for the guy to the left and right of you. It's like, you knowl don't do it for yourself, do it for the guy next to you. So if you're gone, they're going to be carrying more weight because you're gone. So in order to continue on, you have to make sure the guy next to you is OK, because that's what really matters. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. You were doing it to support them. Did you feel supported by the group? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Yes, I did. I mean, I was fortunate enough- the guys in my boat crew who were also of similar heights. You know, I think I was fortunate to have a group of solid guys who we became very close with. So that driving factor of, \"I care about these guys. I want them to succeed as much as I want to succeed.\" So I think that really is what pushed me all the way through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you ever thinking about somebody who wasn't in that immediate situation like that when he doesn't want your family or your-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it would be my mentors, people that I talked to when I told them, like, I'm going to do this, like you said, to do this dream go all the way. You're not going to come back until you fail so-. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you ever thinking about them in the moment when it was hard? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmmm, no it was more so at the end of the day, it's like, hey, \"I made it through another day.\" I can tell them that I'm continuing on. But in a moment, It was the guys that drived me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So did you have any practices, physical and mental, spiritual that you used to push through the challenges? Any prayers, or mantras, sometimes athletes will do a routine before they go into a game situation. Do you have anything that you used? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI said the simple mantra in my head, it was, kind of, you know, \"Brothers do it for them. And that was just in the same vein for the guys that I did not do it for them.\" So I would tell myself that things are rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I couldn't hear the, \"Do it for them\". Who is them? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a very broad thing, but, you know, it kind of encompasses the guys beside me as well as, you know, my family and friends back home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So when you made a difficult decision during training to BUD/S. What went through your mind as you made that decision? And what was there a decision you really struggled with an example like appearance, running classmates out, or turning into a cheating classmate. Really struggle with any decision? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning classmates out was a big one. You know, I like them as a person? But, if they were going to be a liability and cause of injury to myself or the guys who were putting out and performing, then, yes, it's always tough to see that. But in the end, you're going to make a decision that's going to be good for the whole of the class. So if someone wasn't keeping up or wasn't carrying their weight, then... they need to be removed from the program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting back to this larger- what's what's better for the greatest number of people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExactly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in getting this far? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think a big part of it was having those mentors and kind of having idea what was coming. So being mentally prepared for it and knowing, you know, it's going to suck for a while, but you can do it because people before you have done it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you notice anything different about those that did not make it? Those that dropped?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there was a fear- whether that was a fear of failure or fear of of what's to come next rather than, you know, just being in that moment- was the biggest defining factor. Guys would most of the guys that quit, quit before an evolution, not during it, but before it because, it was \"oh I'm scared to do this. This guy is just going to suck.\" So I think there was a trend that I saw these in the classes in my class in first phase was if guys were quitting, it was a quiet moment in between an evolution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So how does this experience, BUD/S, changed you as a person? And if so, how?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I think the biggest thing is that the confidence, knowing what you know, whatever you can throw at me, whatever the instructor throws me, whatever situation is going to be, it doesn't matter, you're gonna get through it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything else? I haven't asked that you- insights you have to, what would make a successful candidate and what we should be looking for when we screen? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I think those questions are pretty good things. It's just, you know, asking about the mental aspect. What you have, you know, mentally in your in your headspace, that's really the biggest aspect of it. But I think to those questions, covered it pretty well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much.

So I just have a series of questions - we got about fifteen minutes to go over them - they are somewhat open ended questions, so answer them however you feel appropriate. \r\n\r\nOkay, Awesome.\r\n\r\nUm when did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nStarted BUD/S, let\u2019s see, I started with 38. Um, I couldn\u2019t tell you the exact date, I believe it was in June. \r\n\r\nOf \u201819?\r\n\r\nYes, umm, But yeah I couldn\u2019t tell you the exact date of when we started BUD/S Orientation, but I know it was somewhere around then.\r\n\r\nUm is this your first BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nHow many uh siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nI have two sisters. \r\n\r\nAre they older, younger?\r\n\r\nUh, both of them are older.\r\n\r\nSo sister - sister - you?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nWhat was your, um, parental situation growing up?\r\n\r\nUmm\u2026 had ya know, mom and dad were never divorced. Had a really solid family life. Umm, they were really supportive. \r\n\r\nSo your parents are married?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with them now, is it good? \r\n\r\nUh..yeah - normal. Good relationship with my parents. Call them about once a week. \r\n\r\nWhat, if any, life-changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUhhmm. I wouldn\u2019t say there were any big life changing event. Ya know, I don\u2019t really have any big life changing moments like that.\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm\u2026 I\u2019d say just being like stubborn, or not, I guess, just the idea of ya know whatever the guy next to me can take, I can take that. Kind of uh, tough and competitive personality.  \r\n\r\nDescribe your background that led you to pursue becoming part of the SEAL community? So for instance, do you have any SEALs as family or friends? Do you have any um family members in the military? How did you - what motivated you to do this?\r\n\r\nSo I don\u2019t know anybody in the community. Umm, and the only people in the military in my family were my grandpa on my dad\u2019s side - I believe he was in the Army. And then my great grandpa on my mom\u2019s side was in the Navy. Umm, but they never really talked about their involvement in the military. Umm so I wouldn\u2019t say I had much of  a military influence growing up. If I did, I would say I probably would\u2019ve decided to do this sooner. Umm, but yeah, I didn\u2019t really have any military influences, I just decided to do it. \r\n\r\nSo there - so there\u2019s no military influence, but what made you decide to?\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to do it just because I uh finished college and\u2026 I - just to back track from that - so I grew up on a farm. I, uh, kinda always had it in my head that I was gonna farm someday, and I was always working on the family farm, ya know every summer.  When I got to college it was just every summer, but growing up I was always helping out. And uh, I uh, ya know, I knew that - it was kind of like when you know your future - it\u2019s almost a little scary, ya know. Like when you know exactly where you\u2019re going to be - I wanted something that was exciting, something that was challenging. Umm, I always had this idea in my mind that I would do something big. I really had no, no reason to think that - just kind of always had this sense of confidence that I could accomplish something, but I never really had a chance to prove that, until I decided I was gonna do this pipeline. Um, so I would say, ya know, after college, just working on the farm, driving tractor for long hours, listening to podcasts of, ya know, ex-Navy SEALS, and, um kind of getting turned on to um, the uh, the challenge of it, kind of led me to wanna pursue that and see a recruiter and start talking about it.  \r\n\r\nOkay, so tell me a little bit about your childhood - for example, how were you disciplined? \r\n\r\nUmm.. so as far as disciplining, I was definitely spanked - um ya know for, for good reason, and I deserved it when, when it happened. Umm..I think my dad, uh, used a belt like one time, um, in a, ya know, a spanking way, um but definitely no abuse or anything like that. It was - I have no, ya know, traumatic memories of that happening.\r\n\r\nDid you get grounded, or have things taken away? \r\n\r\nYeah - yeah. Uh I remember in high school I got my truck taken away for a while. Umm, yeah I\u2019d say - spankings, umm, yeah nothing too crazy.\r\n\r\nDid you move, uh, through your childhood and teenage years?\r\n\r\nNo, I stayed - I like moved - so on the farm I grew up in this kindof older house, and then we built a new house right next to it, so I lived in the same little small town my whole life.\r\n\r\nWhere? \r\n\r\nUh it\u2019s right outside Sacramento.\r\n\r\nOh in California?\r\n\r\nYeah, in California.\r\n\r\nSo tell me about your teenage years, did you participate in team sports?\r\n\r\nYeah so, my freshman year I wrestled and played football. My sophomore year I just played football. And then, my junior year I played basketball and wrestled, or played basketball and played football, because between my sophomore and junior year I switched high schools and they didn\u2019t have a wrestling team, so I decided to play basketball instead. And then my senior year I believe I did, uh, football and track.\r\n\r\nWhat have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nUh last five years - let\u2019s see so 20 to, or 19 to 24. So I was up at Chico State, I was going to school up there, um graduated in 2017. And then, after college I traveled for about a month - and then, started working on a ranch down outside of Monterey, where I worked until I decided to do this. So I worked there for almost two years, um, mostly doing manual labor, driving tractor, um working with livestock, so basically just living kind of a ranch life. Tra- training, uh after work, running, um I didn\u2019t know how to swim so I had to teach myself how to swim, kindof after I had already talked to a recruiter. I failed my first PST horribly. Uh, and then got in the pool like every day.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s a PST? \r\n\r\nPST is like the physical screening test.\r\n\r\nThe screening test?\r\n\r\nYeah - so they, you have like a swim time and I think it\u2019s like 12 minutes to pass. I was like - it\u2019s a 500 yard swim and I had never swam 500 yards before in my life. So I like, ya know, realized I had a lot of work to do. And then, like, one, I like swam everyday and passed and they gave me a contact, and I was like holy crap, about to go, ya know, to bootcamp, and I just learned how to swim, ya know, like a month ago. So that was kind of the uh...\r\n\r\nIn Navy bootcamp do you do any swimming? \r\n\r\nYou do, you do - they don\u2019t teach you anything. Ya know in Prep they taught you how to swim a little bit, in BUD/S Prep. But uh, that was probably where I had - ya know, the biggest warrior for me was the water. Because, ya know, it\u2019s not like I, ya know, didn\u2019t know how to, I had swam before and gone to the lake and ya know swam, ya know, but I never really like swam laps or had any formal training and, ya know, swimming lessons and stuff like that, so. But yeah, to get back to your question, it was either, ya know, during the summer working on the farm, during the school year going to college, and then after college back to work on a different ranch. \r\n\r\nSo after you - so, you quit working on the ranch and joined the Navy? \r\n\r\nYeah, so uh.\r\n\r\nHow long have you been in the Navy? \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been in the Navy for about a year now. \r\n\r\nSo you signed up specifically to come to BUD/S? \r\n\r\nRight - yeah.\r\n\r\nSo you, you came in, you went to boot camp...\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAnd then you went to..\r\n\r\nBUD/S Prep\r\n\r\nGreat, Great Lakes? \r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\nAnd then here?\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAlright, wow. Um, would you consider yourself to be impulsive?\r\n\r\nUh, I can be, yeah, I would say so.\r\n\r\nAnd it sounds like you decided to join the Navy, that - that wasn\u2019t really an impulsive decision, it was, ya know, thinking about it, right?\r\n\r\nKind of, I kinda... I kind of realized that like I was ya know - I think I was still 24 at the time. Um, or no I was 23 at the time. I kind of like, kind of had like a life crisis I guess, an early life crisis. Where uh, I figured ya know I can do this farming thing for the rest of my life and get into it right now, or I can do this - ya know - try the whole Navy SEAL thing, and ya know, do something more. Um, I guess you could kind of say, I just, I just felt kinda stuck, I needed uh, needed a change. So...and, ya know I feel like most all the guys that make it, they just kind of have this sense about them, or they, they have some, some sort of, ya know, confidence that just, I don\u2019t know what is stems from but they just - they know they\u2019re going to make it. Ya know, like when I signed away 6 years of my life, like, I knew I was going to make it. Ya know, I mean, if you don\u2019t believe it, then ya know who\u2019s going to believe it? So, looking back on it, it seems pretty crazy that I just like signed a paper, ya know, here we go, six years but, ya know it\u2019s all worked out, so. \r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos? \r\n\r\nNo, no tattoos.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s an example of impulsivity, or so, or so they think. \r\n\r\nRight, yeah.\r\n\r\nOr so someone has written.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. \r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging part of, of BUD/S? Like a particular event, or particular day or?\r\n\r\nUmm, I\u2019d say first phase was the worst, I mean that\u2019s where I was had, ya know, I was tested the most was definitely in first phase, where ya know, for me I would say like the log PT\u2019s were, were the hardest thing for me. Um, coming into it I thought the water was going to be the hardest thing. But uh, I would say log PT and OC8. I got rolled for OC8, that\u2019s why I got rolled to 39 - so pool comp. Um, but...\r\n\r\nIs that where a lot of people get rolled?\r\n\r\nYeah that\u2019s pretty common. But uh..\r\n\r\nFor the drown-proofing, or ?  \r\n\r\nUh so that was in first phase - I didn\u2019t have any problem with that, uh, but in OC8 I, I uh failed it - ya know, I passed my fifth attempt so I failed it - passed out like two times, almost three times in the water. Um, so yeah I would say probably logs and pool comp were the two hardest things for me.\r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\nJust being stubborn I would say - just, ya know - and then, thinking about, like I always had a rationale, like clear head, where when you quit, you like know where you\u2019re going. It\u2019s like - yes, you\u2019re gonna ya know have comfort for, ya know, that day, but ya know your mind isn\u2019t going to let you live that down that you quit, and then to go home, ya know, and tell your family that you quit, and all your friends and everyone that knows that you\u2019re doing this pipeline, ya know. There\u2019s a lot, a lot on the line there, so. No matter how bad it was. As long, as long as you - as long as I kept a rational mind and thought about the consequences of what it means to quit I was never going to do it. And, ya know, I never thought about doing it as hard as it got, ya know. There were times where I was like worried that am I going to get performance dropped right now,  am I like not performing well enough right now. But never in my mind was it that I was going to go voluntarily end my BUD/S career, ya know.\r\n\r\nDid you feel like you were supported by others?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, yeah, because you are with the guys since boot camp, so - you\u2019re all, all in it together. For sure.\r\n\r\nSo what practices, and to some extent you just answered this - but maybe there\u2019s something more, what practices: physical, mental, spiritual, or etc. did you use to push through the challenges? \r\n\r\nUm, I think the biggest thing for me, was like I said, just keeping, not making an emotional decision, and keeping your rational mind where ya think about, ya know, how stupid it is to quit, especially when you\u2019ve made it this far. Like by the time you get to Hell Week, you\u2019ve already put in, ya know, months and months of training, and boot camp, and BUD/S Prep, and BUD/S Orientation, just like by that time it\u2019s like, ya know, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to just tap out, ya know because...\r\n\r\nWhen you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made the decision? Um, and what decision, you can give an example, did you really struggle with? And the examples that give here are: running classmates out or turning in someone who\u2019s cheating.\r\n\r\nUm, let me think about that one for a second. Um. I can\u2019t think of any particular instance. I know...I know that\u2019s happened, ya know. That happens a lot in this pipeline, ya know. Like, If someone is really underperforming, they will get run out. And then, as far as turning someone in, like my attitude, um, would be to handle things in class, and not, and handle it at the lowest level. But, I really can\u2019t think of any decision I\u2019ve made personally, although I have witnessed, witnessed those kinds of decisions being made.\r\n\r\nDid you notice - so, we\u2019re pretty much out of time, I don\u2019t know where the time went here- um, why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI would say just, it sounds super cliche, but just showed up everyday and didn\u2019t quit. That\u2019s all it comes down to - I\u2019m sure you hear that from everybody, but, just a stubborn guy that doesn\u2019t quit.\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different about the folks who didn\u2019t make it? \r\n\r\nUh, I would say they had a moment of weakness and made an emotional decision. Um, other than that, that\u2019s ya know, everyone has a time where it\u2019s like, ya know - they, everyone has something they struggle with ya know, and some people get through it and some people feel sorry for themselves, and just end up quitting. So - they make an emotional decision and just want to get out of the pain right away, and just, just quit. \r\n\r\nHow did this experience change you as a person, if it did?\r\n\r\nUm, I would say it just makes you realize that you can do things that before you thought were impossible I guess, or. Basically you are capable of so much more - and the human body can do so much that, ya know. When you are pushed to do something, you can step up to the plate and do it, so.\r\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s about it, so thanks.\r\n\r\nCool, thank you.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Bradley\r\n\r\nDate: 23AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 356\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 00:13:17\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Scott Lynch\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 356\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is particiopany 356. I've got about eight questions broken into 100 parts each, broken into a few parts each so uh but we've got 15 so we should be able to get through it. So they're somewhat open ended questions but ya know if you keep your answers relatively concise we should be able to make it all the way through. \r\n\r\nOh yeah I shouldn't have a problem with that.\r\n\r\nWhen did you start BUD/S?\r\n\r\nOh I started May of 2019.\r\n\r\n18 or 19?\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\n19. Is this your first BUD/S experience?\r\n\r\nYes it is.\r\n\r\nHow many siblings do you have?\r\n\r\nUh I have three siblings.\r\n\r\nWhats uh the uh sex and uh sequence?\r\n\r\nUh I have three older sisters.\r\n\r\nThree older sisters. Just out of curiosity, how old is the oldest?\r\n\r\nI think she's about to be 30 or is already 30. I'm not 100 percent sure.\r\n\r\nWha- what's your uh parental situation growing up? What was it?\r\n\r\nUh great I...\r\n\r\nMom, Dad?\r\n\r\nI have a mom and dad yeah. \r\n\r\nAnd then your parents were married?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nAnd you have, do you have, what's the relationship you have with them right now?\r\n\r\nUh I have a fantastic relationship with them.\r\n\r\nSo what, if any, uh life changing events happened in your life prior to coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh I\u2019d say the main thing was uh my best friend died when he was 16. He had a heart attack.\r\n\r\nOne of my best friends died in a car accident at that age. Two of them actually together. Um how did that factor or that experience factor into your uh experience at BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm it it's the sole reason I'm here really. It's like the big overarching reason I acutally came. Uh I think it helped me a lot to keep in mind that I was doing this for uh more for people than just my own sake. \r\n\r\nIn what way?\r\n\r\nUh it just made me uh put into put my life into retrospect for myself and realize that uh i should never be doing things for myself i should just try to help others as much as possible and I think that's helped a lot going through buds. \r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUmm im pretty quiet and reserved guy so i think uh it kinda helped just keeping my head down and not making a lot of noise.\r\n\r\nSo describe your background that led you to pursuing becoming a part of the SEAL community? Uh do you have any SEALs as family members or friends?\r\n\r\nNo no actually uh my parents aren't even, they're from England so they\u2019re not even citizens of the US. I just uh one day wanted to do something more than just working construction back home so I went to the recruiter's office and they handed me the pamphlet for this program and uh I decided to do it. \r\n\r\nOk so let me ask some questions about your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child?\r\n\r\nUh my parents were always strict like they never like beat me if I did anything wrong, they just...\r\n\r\nWere you spanked or? \r\n\r\nNo no no they just corrected by talking to me sitting down explaining why things were wrong and why I shouldn\u2019t do them. \r\n\r\nDid you move throughout your childhood?\r\n\r\nYes uh three or four times.\r\n\r\nWere these uh like uh major moves or?\r\n\r\nYeah I moved from um Massachusetts to Texas back and forth both times, all the times\r\n\r\nMassachusetts to Texas to Massachusetts and\u2026\r\n\r\nBack to Texas yeah\r\n\r\nSo MA to Texas to Massachusetts to Texas again. Quite a cultural change.\r\n\r\nYes it was.\r\n\r\nUm tell me about your teenage years. Were you involved in high school sports or team events or team ya know community or anything like that?\r\n\r\nI played lacrosse, football and I ran track and cross country.\r\n\r\nAny other team events? \r\n\r\nUh i was on the robotics team \r\n\r\nWhat have you done for the list 5 years prior to coming to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019m 21 so I was in high school and then uh I worked construction and landscaping and I worked in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nLike as a cook or as waiter or\u2026?\r\n\r\nUh, I was a waiter.\r\n\r\nAnd then you joined the Navy?\r\n\r\nYup I joined the navy.\r\n\r\nDid you go straight from signing up or enlisting to um\u2026. So no college?\r\n\r\nNo college.\r\n\r\nSo did you, you enlisted and you went straight to basic or bootcamp or whatever its called in the Navy?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAnd um then to Great Lakes?\r\n\r\nThen to Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nThen here. Like a lot of people follow that, follow that track. Would you consider yourself as impulsive?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\nI do\r\n\r\nHow many \r\n\r\nOne\r\n\r\nIs that supposed to be a sign of impulsive?\r\n\r\nOh I thought about that one for a long time.\r\n\r\nYeah some still think it's that way. What was the most challenging component of BUD/S either like a hardest day or hardest event or?\r\n\r\nUm life saving was probably one of the harder ones. It's a lot of... (unintelligible 8:00-8:01)... stress during the actual event too. \r\n\r\nWhat's involved in that? \r\n\r\nUm you have to uh buddy tow on of the instructors across the pool but uh there's three different types of rescues you have to do you have to do an active front, an active rear, and a passive and so during the active and the, the active front and rear, they\u2019re fighting you the whole time so they'll like grab you and roll or they\u2019ll grab you and try and like pull you under water. Like act like a panicking victim so you have to uh react to the situation and follow the proper procedures to break away and uh successfully tow them to the other side keeping their head above the water. \r\n\r\nSo what motivated you to push through?\r\n\r\nUh I mean I just... Same thing for uhh all of BUD/S pretty much I knew I wanted to be here. After uh seeing all the guys around me just the whole mental attitude of everyone here and uh I wasn't gonna quit. \r\n\r\nDid you feel a lot of support from the, from everyone else, from the group?\r\n\r\nOh yeah everyone is always supporting everybody. \r\n\r\nWere there any practices that you used like physical, mental, spiritual to help you get through?\r\n\r\nUm I mean yeah I'm religious. I'm not like overtly religious but I definitely am, I pray, I think about that stuff a lot but also like breathing staying calm and keeping collected the whole time. \r\n\r\nWhen you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Uh so was there a decision at some point that you really struggled with? Like for instance uh whether to turn someone in for cheating or to run someone out?\r\n\r\nUh it\u2019s pretty easy uh I just always did something, did whatever was right like uh either morally or by the instructions that were given to us. My boat crew never had to run anyone out. We were all pretty tight, pretty close with each other.\r\n\r\nSo so was there ever a difficult decision?\r\n\r\nUh in my opinion no, i think it was all pretty cut and dry. What we were supposed to be doing.  \r\n\r\nWhy do you think you were successful at completing buds?\r\n\r\nUh I think cuz I didn't ever have the idea that I was gonna quit. Once I was here I was gonna be here the whole time.\r\n\r\nDid you notice anything different about the people who didn't make it through?\r\n\r\nHonestly I didn't really think a lot about them. Obviously you know people who quit but you only them for such a short period of time you never get to know them all that well. \r\n\r\nHow quickly do they drop out?\r\n\r\nUh like 1st phase you know the first three weeks a lot of people drop and then uh obviously the fourth week, Hell Week,  it's not actually that many that drop during Hell Week but uh within the first four weeks you pretty much know who's gonna be here and who's not.\r\n\r\nSo how did this experience change you as a person?\r\n\r\nUm I think it it really just reinforced what uh I already believed in. Just doing the right thing no matter what.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that I should have asked you about that I haven't that helped you or hurt you uh in getting through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nNo I don't think so anything in particular.\r\n\r\nPretty much said everything?\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\nAlright then.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re done. \r\n\r\nThank you very much sir.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Andrew Malick\r\n\r\nDate: 12AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 81 switched to 358 (81_358_2020.02.10_10.56_01.mp3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 16:16\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Alex Deitrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it ok if I record? \r\n\r\nIt is OK.\r\n\r\nGreat. And can you tell me your participant ID and sort of explain why you have two numbers here? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81 and 358. 81 was given to me in class 338 after I got rolled. I was given a number 358, in 339. \r\n\r\nAwesome. Thanks for clarifying that. So when did you start BUD/S with that original class? \r\n\r\nAs in Coronado, or when did I start like the whole-? \r\n\r\nYeah. When was your- When did you start training? \r\n\r\nUh, We got our class checked into into Coronado in April of 2018. \r\n\r\nOK.\r\n\r\nThat was my first class with 337 actually. \r\n\r\nAnd is this your first BUD/S experience? \r\n\r\nIt is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): Ok great. So I'm going to ask you about your family. Are you- do you have siblings? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have one sister.\r\n\r\nOk, older or younger? \r\n\r\nUh, younger, she's two years younger than me. \r\n\r\nAnd are you parents married, seperated, divorced? \r\n\r\nDivorced\r\n\r\nWhen did that happen? \r\n\r\nSix or seven years ago. \r\n\r\nSo you were older. You were in highschool? \r\n\r\nAbout, I\u2019d say I was a freshman or sophomore in high school. \r\n\r\nOK, How was that experience? Was it impactful? \r\n\r\nWhen they finally got divorced, It wasn't a surprise. We knew it was coming, wasn't easy at first, but, gotta get used to it. \r\n\r\nHow's your relationship, with your parents now? \r\n\r\nDecent. Decent now. \r\n\r\nWith each? Or...? \r\n\r\nYeah, decent with both. \r\n\r\nOK. And your relationship with your sister? \r\n\r\nGood. I try to stay in touch with as much as I can. \r\n\r\nSIO: Yeah. Were there any other life changing events that happened in your life prior to BUD/S?\r\n\r\nUh, not really. I mean, we tried to try to join the Navy when I was 18 to come here, and my eyesight was too poor, so I moved out of the house. It seemed like the right time. Stars aligned at that point. So when I was 18 and kept pursuing this goal, after I got LASIK eye surgery. \r\n\r\nOK. So how long did that take you, to get the surgery and?\r\n\r\nI got the surgery immediately after I was disqualified for the program. And then I moved to Texas two months after that. And after that it took about two years to get contracted out. \r\n\r\nAnd what did you do during that time?\r\n\r\nI worked with a friend who moved down there, started his own company. So he started going door to door sales with him. Moved to corporate security after that. \r\n\r\nInteresting. So, do you, is there anything else? And the other major events? \r\n\r\nLife changing? Not particularly. \r\n\r\nAny college? \r\n\r\nOh, yes. I went to college for about a year and a half. And, uh, just I knew I was going to come here. My mom encouraged college because she wanted me to get my degree before I- if I ended up doing this why not make it college prior to this? I couldn't study, I was just burnt out from it. I wasn't having a good time or it didn't some fun and exciting. And I didn't really have a major that I just committed to. So I just decided I'm just going to enlist now... do that later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo how do any of these experiences factor into your experience at BUD/S? \r\n\r\nPrior experiences? If I went at 18 I don't know if I would've made it. I was immature. Learned a lot. I had a lot of life experience, in those two years. Screwed up, became way more independent. Just uh, devolved... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSIO: How do you think your personality affected your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n...Uh, not one of the higher physical performances in the class, but boys, uh... Find out. Always had a personality that I feel like is just trying to help out. Trying to kind of help the team. I always had a teammate attitude. So I think that helps as well as just being a decent person to everyone, regardless of who they are, how they treat you. So I feel like that has developed me through that's definitely helped develop me through this pipeline and essentially just kind of building that team work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: OK. So, you mentioned this desire to pursue this community. Do you have any family or friends that were SEALs? Or how did you- what really gave you that spark, that inspiration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was in high school, I had a lot of friends that joined the Marine Corps. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with my life, yet. The military was always kind of in the back of my head. And when they all started going to the Marine Corps, I uh, that was initially the plan. I was- Marines were always like the superhero. Like, \"Those guys were the toughest dudes and studs. Started working out with them. Uh, did some of their PTs with their leaders and stuff. I started, uh, training in my own time getting into shape. But that's kind of a phyical low, but I got into shape and I started becoming one of the fastest runners. They didn't feel like I was being challenged. So I wanted to try something more wishful- Marine recon. And uh, I was pursuing that for a while. And our friend in my hometown said, \"Oh, I'm saying for the SEALs\". I mean there was this old retired SEAL guy that trains, and \"you should meet him.\" And I met him, and this kind of attitude and outlook on life, and how humble he was made me switch. The job isn't that much different, but I really like the way this guy acts, I want to be that guy.\r\n\r\nAnd did he serve as- the roll of of mentoring-. \r\n\r\nYes. He was actually from the start of the company down in Texas. I moved down there and kind of always... Focused... like he was my boss, but he also had that unique understanding of what he would focus on this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So lets talk a little more about your childhood, how we disciplined as a child? Like what was their parenting style? Did they spank you, was it free-range parenting? \r\n\r\nIt kind of depended. I was someone that had... Physical punishment was ever like... if I really. As a younger child, that was like a standing, but it was never like a... as I got older. It's just like, okay, well, you're not going out with friends. You don't get your phone or... Privaledges were- Stuff that definitely as a kind, sucked, but nothing that was like, crazy. \r\n\r\nOK. And did you move around throughout your childhood? \r\n\r\nUh, I moved... \r\n\r\nCause your parents separated. \r\n\r\nMy dad, my dad and well, I stayed in the same house. So I, uh, till I came here.\r\n\r\nOK. So you didn\u2019t even have to move schools, or? \r\n\r\nThe only time I moved schools was when I moved from one city to another. I was about... about 6th grade. So right when I- one moved from when I was in sixth grade from a place 60 miles away, and that was totally fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, so, tell me about your teenage years. Did you play a team sport or an activity with a tight-knit community? \r\n\r\nI played hockey since I was about eight years old. Just on a competitive level- so Ice Hockey and that's pretty much it. That's pretty much it. I thought about getting involved in other sports, but hockey was my focus. \r\n\r\nHow many years? \r\n\r\nThe last time I played on a team was senior year of high school. So 8 years, to what, 18? Maybe 10 years of competitive play. \r\n\r\nOK, so already talked about it a bit, but five years before BUD/S, so you had two years working? \r\n\r\nTwo, roughly two years, yes. \r\n\r\nTwo years working, then a year and a half of college? \r\n\r\nYes. During that year and a half, I was getting really focused on...\r\n\r\nOk and before that was high school? \r\n\r\nYes. A lot of that, pretty much most of that time I was focused on. \r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah you were, training, for BUD/S, OK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO And then would you consider yourself impulsive? \r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, depends on what what it is. \r\n\r\nOK, so, for example, like, do you have any tattoos that you got on a whim? \r\n\r\nNo tattoos. I'm not planning on ever getting tattoos. \r\n\r\nSpeeding tickets? \r\n\r\nEeeee, I have one. I have one speeding ticket but, I.... \r\n\r\nOK. Do you have, like, big spending, did you see a car and buy it? \r\n\r\nI don't buy expensive cars, but I have a tendency to collect. Like, not collect cars. But like I have a- I'm a big car guy so I'll like, ahhh see  like this unique or weird car and be like, \"I really want to buy that thing because it's really unique and rare.\" \r\n\r\nYou don't- you're not impulsive and...? \r\n\r\nI just, I can't, I won't bankrupt myself. It's like, it's like, in Princeton, I bought a ill-advised.. It's an ill advised decision but I found a car that my dad and I have been talking about our project for. \r\n\r\nCool. \r\n\r\nSo I found one, I found, I've been in a Fontana. \r\n\r\nSo you researched it? \r\n\r\nAnd I think a week as I drove up there. Yeah, I do. I know-\r\n\r\nIt's more of a hobby. \r\n\r\nIt is. It's more of a hobby, but it's kind of a obsession I suppose. \r\n\r\nSo we're really trying to get at decision, right. You make analytical decisions where you think them through and do research and plan, and meticulous thinking. \r\n\r\nIt's very meticulous. It's... I mean, if it gets impulsive in that I know a lot about it, but if something pops up like the stars are like, okay, so this is like this is what I've been looking for for a while and I'll see it 20 minutes later and I can buy it but like It's usually a case decision.... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: What was the most challenging component of BUD/S? So, this could be like a day, or an event... or, uhhh, some guys say, like, \"logs\", or \"water\". \r\n\r\nI don't know if I can really narrow it down to a specific evolution. All of it's difficult. It's getting cold. It's definitely a mental challenge. But if there were no rules, I think the most challenging part is to... Always, always keep your self-confidence up. Never let that nagging thought of am I doing good for it? \"Am I... am I doing well enough for the team?\" to not creep in, even if you're doing perfectly fine. That was something I always get in my head is \"am I hurting people?\" I never came to the conclusion that I was always, I was always thinking about that because I didn't want to hold anyone back, or be a liability. So that was always kind of a treat on my mind.\r\n\r\nSo when those thoughts were creeping in, or when you got rolled, and you kinda said like \"ohhh, it like, do all this over again\". How did you- what motivated you to push through that challenge? \r\n\r\nOh, the dedication to wanting to be here, I guess. I mean... Sure. I mean, I know I'm not one of the.... Division one athletes in the class, but uh... it really boils down to how much you want it, how committed you are to being here. Nothing else matters. If you wanted to do- well for most guys it's you want to do- how badly do you want your job, how badly do you want it? So it's really just boils down to your self-confidence and self... Your desire i guess to be part of and willing to serve this community. So I know it's not going to be- it's going to there's going to be harder times, that what were put through here, so there's never going to get easier. You kind of have to accept that its our job to get through this. And that's going to be way easier than the....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you have any practices, like physical, mental, spiritual, that you used to pursue the challenges?\r\n\r\nA lot of self talk. \r\n\r\nYeah? What did it sound like? Did you have any mantras?\r\n\r\nUh, no. It wasn't a really matras, I never even really about training. I would just kind of talk to myself. It took one mind off, whatever was really happening, and essentially forgot about everything that was going on. And like, I always thought about, like what I was, \"oh, my car's broken down.\" What I to do to it this weekend, I thought through- like I said, I need to work on this part, work on that. So I was kinda, I always kinda mentally just, especially during the more challenging \"not this\" evolutions, took my mind out of it and put it someplace else. So it's like something that happens, \"Oh, wow yeah, training.\" \r\n\r\nUh, this is really interesting cause some guys will say that they, instead had developed this intense focus. Right, like, this is where I am, this is what I'm doing. But you actually, removed yourself. \r\n\r\nYeah. and it depends. So like they were- in the evolution that required focus, by, for instance, in third phase, when were doing IADs, I'd say that it's definitely more of a,  focus mode, but if it was something like a two and a half mile swim that was like extremely long. I would just, start thinking about other things and just completely forget about the swimming portion so, that autopilot, I feel like that helped, had they talked about how difficult... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Uh, when you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Uh, and is there a decision that you really struggled with at BUD/S. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficult decisions? Such as? \r\n\r\nFor example, running classmates out or turning in a cheating classmate or the decision to go to medical, even though, you know, you might get rolled. \r\n\r\nThat was a difficult decision was definitely medical, I got rolled in second base. It's okay, especially after I was well, the first time those nagging me on my head but like, \"Oh I might get dropped for this.\". \r\n\r\nSo why did you do it? \r\n\r\nI knew if I had continued, it probably would have been extremely dangerous to my health if I hadn't gone. I could've, essentially like, like extreme risk for ...\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Isaac Bengel\r\n\r\nDate: 8/12/20\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 359\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 18:19\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue):\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, uh. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it's OK to record me. I'm participant number 359 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n359, OK. Trying to figure out the best way, to set this up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, no worries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry, I'm on East Coast time and like, what time is it? hahaha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not 10 o'clock haha. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAwful enough haha. So easy questions to start with. When did you start um BUDS? Where you with three three nine? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was with 337 so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was uh May of last year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so May of 2019? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd had you ever tried to do BUDS prior to that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNope. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is your first. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst time. OK. And then where are you kind of coming from? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm from Boston. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh and I went to Tufts University. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI played college sports there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh is that what you mean by that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah. So. So were you. Did you do OCS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I'm an officer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to OCS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK, and is this kind of your your first things you did OCS then you came straight To BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so easy questions to start with. How many siblings do you have? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA younger sister. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA younger sister, Ok. how much younger? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm she is two and a half years older. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. And then what was your kind of parents parental situation growing up? Two parent households. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo parent household. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time growing up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd your first...see you answered my question and got me even asking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere ya go, that's good \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm and how's your relationship with your parents? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood, really good. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd has it always been that way. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Very much so um growing up we were in Massachussetts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were times where my parents were like just focus on (intelligible)? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. OK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was for a couple years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a great relationship with my parents. I consider my upbringing normal but I think but I think to most people it's not normal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah. Do you think what kind of years of your childhood was she sick. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm she was basically sick until my 13th birthday. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first 13 years of my life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was a lot for her. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing through that but yeah, also like it changed the dynamic going through that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah absolutely it changes the dynamic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt home and everything. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think that kind of situation shaped kind of your viewpoint on life? When you are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly probably but it's hard to say because I I thought it was normal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought it was like everyone's life but it wasn't so yes, yes ma'am but I don't know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. No. Makes sense. That's a good answer. What kind of life changing experiences or events happened your life prior to coming to BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm nothing crazy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a very normal upbringing in life but I mean life changing could be considered college I went to private high school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was considered successful. I won national championships and state championships I think that to me was life changing and I was on some great teams as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider to be life changing as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sport was that again? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI played football and lacrosse in college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd growing up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so and so you played them both in college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's great. That's not that common right? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha That's kind of intense. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah it was fun though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, tell me a little bit about kind of your experience being on sports. Like what what what's great about it? What wasn't great about it? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I love the team team aspects I love winning. I like the competitiveness and the common goals everyone on that team is working together for a common goal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings you don't like about it? Um I think it's like anything like if you have uh (intelligible), you learn a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have bad people on the team you need to get rid of them and you have to figure out how to get that team to be successful without being distracted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like all of it is positive if I'm being honest, I don't find many negatives. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did kind of your experiences, whether in sports or whether they were just growing up, contributed to your experience here at BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I think I was able to draw a lot from a lot of drills from lacross in college and in football in college. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(intelligible) To BUDS. And nothing seemed to me like , Ok I always have something to fall back on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd uh, previous experience or draw from like if I made some mistakes, I could just think back to lacrosse ok this is what we did in this situation. This is how it should be. I think it could be very helpful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Do you have a specific example for all that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSure. Like something that we used to say in lacrosse was like one more. So that can stem from anything from being one more rep in the weight to one more rep in practice to just focus on the next game and I used that in Hell Week all the time to be like hey I'm just going to do one more push up or. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr one more bed check and it was something I didn't need to do it, but it was just like wanting to remind myself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemind me of my buddies back home and it just made things not be as bad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMakes sense, what about your personality? How do you think it contributes to progression for BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. I think uh I can take a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd uh adapt and will to change and my ego is not too big going to get in the way of anyone. I think that was really helpful. And I think ultimately I got to be able to laugh in the face of adversity or pain and just use humor all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow would you describe your personality in general? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm an outgoing, caring person. And a leader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what in your background led you to want to pursue SEALs? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm honestly I just knew I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a firefighter in the community until I was like five and this was pre 9/11. I was like yeah this is what I want to do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny like family members, military, anything like. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dad was a helicopter pilot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Was he active duty growing up? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, yes. Or no, sorry he was active duty before. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Did you move around a lot when you were younger? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I was always in Boston. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, What about, I know this kind of seems strange, but they build into all of this how about as a child? How are you disciplined? What was discipline like? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI parents were really strict, they ran a tight household. Not as bad as helicopter, but they were just around me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on what you did, you'd have to like write an apology or do pushups or something that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in general, with, like, discipline, was there a spanking or was it more like, OK, push ups or timeout or. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, more like timeout or take something away? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRestriction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe asked about it and moved around a lot as a child. So did you always live in Boston? Never kind of. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I was in the Boston area. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow but you did say you spent some time with your cousins growing up when your sister was sick. Was that the same area? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. So we lived in different towns at the time but because I'd go over there so much more we ultimately moved to their town. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it became like an even shorter commute. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. And then how was that living? Like, how long did you live with them or was it just short burst of time? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, it varied like sometimes I wake up in my house and then I'd wake up in their. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr I'd start to go to bed in my house then go to their house but sometimes it would be like a week or more. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to me it was a normal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just thought it was what people did. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha just part of life. It's amazing what child is like. Oh like how you know you don't really realize those things. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, you don't, it seems normal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is, um. What about teenage years? So you talk about you participated in sports. Um anything else that you did besides sports? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I was. I was always a part of student council. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr like anything with leadership rolls. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd um so with sports, I mean how you talked again a little bit about how you think it played in to being here. But um, anything else that kind of you see a link between the sports that you played being here like any other contributors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I think education levels. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that the majority of the dudes here have a college degree. I mean obviously have like four or five, 18 to 20 year olds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n] And one of them his dad is a SEAL also, I think just by virtue of want to read his chances of being successful in htis program are a lot higher. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the other three or four dudes are just really tough. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think education, if you want successful you need to be educated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think it is about education that lets you to be successful? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's a good question. I think it's more like perspective on what you're doing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can kind of you don't think about selfishly about yourself but you can also think of others. And I think you can just take a little bit more \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what did you do in the last five years to kind of prior to becoming coming to BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm once I graduated from college, I took a little time off and I worked. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. What? What did you work? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI worked for the Kraft Group. I was doing data analytics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Interesting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Very normal, I, I uh, very hard for me. It wasn't my first choice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that like a desk job? Right. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesk job. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Interesting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's the New England Patriots, essentially. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk and so was that kind of like your plan or were you always thinking SEALs? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I knew I wanted to do this. I took that job and I talked to the CO, and said hey, look, I'm going to come to BUDS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's more of a matter of time. I'd really like to work and get some experience just doing something else in the meantime. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was like sure, come on board. He like put me in this role. He's like I know you don't have any experience doing this more challenging for you, but like I figure it out you'll be fine. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. How long do you do that? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it was like 10 months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a little bit of time \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, and then training wise, I mean, were you physically training what types of training were you doing outside? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was working out like three times a day I work. I'd workout at lunch. And then I would go in the afternoons and work out again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMkk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my friends for like three, four hours. But in the mornings, my commute was like an hour and a half each way. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was really bad. So in the morninng I couldn't really do much \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got I got that commute right now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah seriously. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha. So would you consider yourself impulsive at all? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I mean, I'm definitely like I get excited when I make decisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI say like let's go. Maybe I don't formulate a plan all the time, like beforehand. Like a comprehensive plan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd maybe I like to figure things out on the fly sometimes, but other than that I think big decsions through a good amount. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. What about do you have any tattoos or anything like speed, lots of speeding tickets. Anything that would indicate. I know we have these strange questions thrown in there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI figured that question was coming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does that fit? Hahaha. What about what do you think the most challenging component of BUDS was?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm personally or what do I think in general. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI failed pool comp my first time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it was challenging because I thought I was comfortable in the water. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I had to get into like another level of comfortability and for me that was just relaxing. I feel like in this program you're taught to really very upright, very hard, but and that instances like hey you just need to relax, like hey you're completely fine just calm down and that's hard for me to like just chill out. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo was there anything you did specifically to kinc of try to calm your mind, learn to relax. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI used visualization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh Mags teaches us here like visualization arousal control uh goal setting, self talk and I just used all of those tools. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat we learned. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat. What kind of motivated you to push through that that challenge? When you failed pool comp. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hated failing and I was embarrassed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore so embarrassed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that was it. Because you said you came in three seven. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got rolled medically. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOK. Um and did you feel like you were supported by the group when you failed pool comp? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, definitely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah well, all they dudes are really helpful and encouraging. How can we help you? Sounds cool to see. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Um we talked a little bit about kind of some of the practices you did. But anything else like whether it's physical, mental, spiritual that you think helped push you through challenges? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm yeah. One thing you can practice the diving on the grinder. They call it dirt diving. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have like PVC pipes, tanks you can use. Any time you can walk through stuff like that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're getting dry runs it was really helpful even like with pistol qual or rifle qual or practicing that trigger pull was really helpful on the island. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about was there a time you had to make a difficult decision during training here? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I mean, again, that was all training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think anything too too challenging that we had to face certainly its organized chaos but I wouldn't say anything too too crazy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas there any, like, cheating that you observed or like a classmate something? you kinda had to. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, there was a kid in my original class after Hell Week we decided he couldn't get up on the obsticals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he decided to go around. And then worded in that he passed but everone in the class saw. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a really well liked kid, a really good performer and we eventually turned him in. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd said hey cheater. And they eventually dropped him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat. What kind of helped make that decision as a group? Was it somebody really pushing the. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me it was a no brainer, he had to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was like hey he's a scumbag I don't want him. But like other guys were like no, he's done really well we should keep him it was like a one time mistake. But it was more so challenging arguing that against different peoples moral ethics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about. Why do you think you were successful completing BUDS? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I think I was just really dug in and focused on it but I think there's a good amount of luck that's also involved. I think I had, like other people would say that I'm am lucky cause I had two rolls. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a med roll and a performance issue. Other guys just go, right though it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can do it right away on one shot like that's a good roulette game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat means you're healthy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRolling to a roll. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn't freezing cold like it's been recently. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, exactly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything that you think is different about you? The fact that you got through it, and people haven't gone through it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink I don't know how you can quantify it. I think, you know prior coming to BUDS whether or not you're going to be successful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd why, what what do you think it is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just knew growing up. I was. I knew I was going to graduate and I knew. It was never an issue. It was more so like do I really wanted to do this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo I want to subject myself to all of this misery and do I want this to be my lifestyle. That was the question. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn't oh I'm wondering if I can make it through, and I don't mean to sound cocky or anything, but I think everyone in this room knew that. That they knew that they were gonna make it through. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a there's a level of confidence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, how has this changed you as a person? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I think it gives you confidence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it's also like your opportunities and potentials untapped. You're never in question. You can literally do anything that you want. Which is cool. Like I've been compared to my other friends and they're like, I think you have superpowers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha you're not the first person that says that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh really. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, it's interesting, you know, but I think that's a good thing I don't think it's a bad thing cause you kinda need it for what you're going to do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh absolutely. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou kinda  have to have that mindset. So uh anything else I should have asked that might contribute to our study. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI include uh well I don't know if it would help but what I would ask if like guys think that they've made like knew they were going to make it through. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that would be very interesting. I think the guys of asked on the handful are like yeah I didn't really know if I'm going to make it going into Hell Week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat are still here today. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, but I think that ulitmately that everyone knew that they were gonna make it through. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat would be the only question. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, great. OK, well, I'm finished. I'm gonna collect your card.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Dan McDonald \r\n\r\nDate: 16 August 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 378\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 9:47\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Dixon\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your participant ID?\r\n\r\n378\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, do you mind if I record you? \r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay great. So when did you start BUDS and is this your first BUDS experience? \r\n\r\nSo, showed up last April. Started with class 337 and uh yeah this is my first BUDS experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd how many, just a little bit of background, how many siblings do you have and what\u2019s the birth order?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got two younger siblings. I\u2019m the oldest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd are they girls, boys?\r\n\r\nGirls. 21 and 18. And I am 24. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd were your parents married, separated, divorced? \r\n\r\nThey\u2019re married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what was your relationship to them? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m super close with my parents. I\u2019d say more so now than when I was younger, but um yeah just have a really good relationship with them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood. Did you have any life changing experiences prior to BUDS? What you consider life changing is whatever I mean by life changing. Like some people say no and other people say like five things. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know if one thing per say was life changing. I think a lot of things culminated in smaller changes that happened over time. But it wasn\u2019t any one thing specifically. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think that I\u2019ve wanted to do this my entire life so its like a little bit easier to look at this whole experience and uh I think in terms of my personality in terms of who I am and who I know myself to be I am very confident. I was confident that I wasn\u2019t going to have too many problems coming through this program. Um yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat made you even want to be a SEAL like do you have military in your family or SEALs that you know? \r\n\r\nSo my grandfather was in the Navy. He was a corpsman during WWII. But that was about it uh. I think what led me to this was, uh took a, uh, a Noviance test we took in high school to see what worked best for us, and I got law enforcement. My uncle was a federal marshall and was talking to him about it, and he said it's really hard to come from. I\u2019m from Massachusetts and the way the policing works there in the city is that all the veterans priority for those who want to go to the Academy. I could go be in the military for a little bit. And from there I decided if I was going to join, I was going to do something that had a big impact on the world, so. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me about your childhood. How were you disciplined as a child? Would you say your parents spanked you, timeouts, withheld toys, physical stuff? \r\n\r\nDefinitely, timeouts. Go to your room and you\u2019ll be in there for a bit. Nothing physical ever really. It was just kind of things being withheld and being alone it wasn't anything super crazy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot? \r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Tell me about your teenage years? Did you do any sports? Anything individually? What specifically did you do? \r\n\r\nI was big into playing football when I was younger. Um, when I was real little, but didn\u2019t play in high school. I did wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu in high school. Played baseball in high school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo were uh either of those a particularly tight knit group? \r\n\r\nNot so much with those teams no. Like we were all close with each other but not in the same manner as like it is here I guess. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat have you done in the last 5 years of your life prior to BUD/S training?  \r\n\r\nUh, went to college. Went to Boston University. Um and a student and graduated in December of. I guess January of 2018. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you ROTC or anything? \r\n\r\nI was in a fraternity, but that was it. I played on the rugby team for a year and that group was really close. But \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?  For example, some people get tattoos impulsively?  \r\n\r\nNo, I don\u2019t think I am impulsive. Maybe like a little bit but nothing like big decisions and what not just kind of smaller stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the most challenging component of BUD/S? Think about your hardest day or event at BUD/S. What motivated to push through?  Did you feel like you were supported by the group? \r\n\r\nGetting rolled out of 338 was probably the hardest probably because it wasn\u2019t anything that I did or the other six guys. It was that they didn\u2019t have enough equipment for us to continue with the class. So they just kind of pulled seven guys and told us to take a seat. So that was really hard. I think the guys that I got rolled with I\u2019m now super close with which is awesome but definitely the guys I was around helped out a lot and I guess the other part of that was talking to my parents, talking to my mom. She said you know everything happens for a reason. That\u2019s the deal. I kind of just looked at it as an opportunity to heal up and rest and get ready to keep on going but that was definitely probably the hardest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you have any practices that helped you get through like physical, mental, spiritual stuff? Routines that you did.\r\n\r\nUm, I think just having like time to myself to sort of think and kind of meditate I guess on everything. There were certain weekends here on 618 I would go to Coronado and get a cup of coffee on Saturday or Sunday morning and facetime my parents. I think that was also something that helped. Definitely something that I have done ever since I got here. Outside of that nothing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must have some very supportive parents. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying as a parent. Yeah, that\u2019s hard. When you made a difficult decision during training at BUD/S, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Some people said they haven\u2019t made a difficult decision and if you haven\u2019t that\u2019s fine too. \r\n\r\nYeah, I haven\u2019t really had any difficult decisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy do you think made you completing successful in completing BUD/S? If I am trying to interview people trying to go into BUDs, what should I look for? What made you successful?\r\n\r\nI think, uh, the level of seriousness they are about this program and how committed they are to it I think if people are\u2026 If people like the idea of being a SEAL or going through this program, they like that, they don\u2019t necessarily understand what the training is going to be. They don\u2019t understand how stressing it is and how taxing it is on yourself physically and mentally. Um, yeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, did you notice the people who didn\u2019t make it, looking around this room, anything different about those that did not make it?  If you could say oh yeah they\u2019re this, they aren\u2019t going to make it through? \r\n\r\nAh, I don\u2019t know if anything definitively could. I think there are, there was uh, guys you talk to them that they didn\u2019t seem as committed. Talking about during first phase on the weekend, could see some guys just really inside themselves thinking about what was going on and then later on that next week, they would quit. So I think uh, definitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo do you mean they were going out and partying and not taking it seriously or they were psyching themselves out?\r\n\r\nThey were psyching themselves out. Just really second guessing what the program was. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did do you think this whole experience changed you as a person?\r\n\r\nI am definitely more confident in myself and my abilities. Um, that\u2019s definitely the big one. Uh, I think I have always been decent at communicating and this program made me even better at communicating. Um, dealing with all sorts of people is another big thing that I\u2019ve learned a lot and grown. Um yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd anything else I should have asked you to help us get, so the Navy is having us do this so that they can pick better of the people who are coming into BUDs? Is there anything I should have asked you? Of course it takes this\r\n\r\nI dont really think so \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo worries. We just finish up with that just in case. That was perfect.

I had the best childhood growing up. We did everything as a family. LSU football games on Saturday, church on Sunday morning, watch the Saints and the Cowboys on Sunday afternoon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd did you grow up in one place? Did you move around a lot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep yeah I grew up in the same house\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Where did you grow up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLafayette, Louisiana\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, um, anything life changing like in your life that happened prior coming to BUDS?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so I was playing professional baseball in uh Colombia South America\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd got ss...ate some bad food and got really sick and uh had to go to the hospital and ever since then I\u2019ve lost sight and ever since then it was the last time I picked up a baseball\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh wow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm and then I just remember coming home from there and I always, I always wanted to become \r\n\r\na SEAL. I thought baseball was my purpose, I wanted to go Major Leagues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo jobs, whole nine yards. I remember my dad picked me up from Louis uh International Airport in New Orleans and I said I\u2019m done with baseball, I wanna be a Navy SEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, so what was the timeframe?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was in um November of 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk\u2026So what were you doing prior to that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinishing school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had um four classes left so it took the next semesters to do that online, and then I started \r\n\r\ntraining for 6 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh huh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s when they shipped me out in February of 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. And then um how do you think that experience of kinda trying to play professional baseball had shaped your experience here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt absolutely had\u2026I had\u2026I felt like I had the mental, baseballs all mental, its physical but mostly a game of nowadays what kind of mentality you have. And I feel like\u2026you know\u2026you have three, if you hit three (intelligible) you\u2019re a hall of famer, so failure is part of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I feel like that helped me\u2026constantly\u2026constantly learning how to fail, and accepting failure, and always trying to succeed and learning how to succeed as well shaped me well to come to BUDS\r\n\r\nYeah\u2026um\u2026could you describe your personality and how you think that contributed to your experience here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery, very high energetic\r\n\r\nOk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm sometimes emotional roller coaster but for the most part very positive um love. I have too much energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha. Was that a good thing here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm in what way? Can you give me an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm for staying positive like always finding humor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn uh the worst situations possible in Hell Week, getting gassed on the island in third phase just always, you know, having that high energy to motivate the guys around me \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\u2026what are the um what made you, you kinda wanna be a SEAL?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm I\u2019ve always loved training for anything I love having a purpose and a goal, and baseball was just not meeting that, and of course reading the books, and you know, watching the movies, and doing more research, and actually understanding the training, and making that commitment, is the most purpose I have ever, I\u2019ve ever had in my life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah anybody military family at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah my dad was in the Army for four years, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh-huh, was that prior to you being around\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was when he was right out of high school, yes ma\u2019am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny friends that are military?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(intelligible)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo um tell me a little bit more about your childhood.

I planned to live there when I retire, don\u2019t know when that will be but\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo back there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, as soon as possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm..what about your teenage years, tell me a little bit about them, tell me about baseball\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to a private school, catholic school, um in high school, and played football and baseball and um excelled in baseball, not too good at football, really excelled in baseball, um and just you know every Saturday morning before the LSU games my dad would go hit, you know work on my craft, something like that um. Yeah just you know, normal high school athletic life, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInner lifestyle. That\u2019s it, yeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm what about any, you talked a little bit about um kinda uh uh playing professional baseball a little bit. Anything else in the last 5 years, you said you were finishing college\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes I went to the University of Arizona\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayed baseball there, and then uh\u2026finished my last year at Troy University, which is where I got my degree from. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm\u2026 and you did that after you came back into?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was taking online classes and giving baseball lessons during that time period\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. And where is, where is Troy University?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. So, you taught baseball, did that, anything else that you did that you were kinda like were you im going, what were you doing to prep? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh.. running, swimming, lifting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMkk. Anything you were doing mentally to prepare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhhh yeah, I listen to this app called HeadSpace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always done it during my baseball career. I absolutely love it. But, other than that, that was it. And then obviously the workouts, which were mentally challenging. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Were you working out with other people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so one of my buddies from back home, uh he\u2019s a fire, a fire fighter, um loved the training aspect of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we just got after it, kinda held each other accountable \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMkk. Um. Would you consider yourself impulsive at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent. I mean everyone is impulsive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo could you describe some of your impulsive behaviors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhhh\u2026I don\u2019t know. As far as the training, or just in life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn life\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you give me an example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm like do you have tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, no tattoos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo tattoos, any like, made any big purchases on a whim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh I bought a dirt bike *snaps fingers* just like that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have, like have you ridden bikes before?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes growing up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk. Um what about lots of speeding tickets, anything like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, yes I have about 4 to 5 speeding tickets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWere they in a short time frame or were they over a year or so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterally innnn probably two months (inaudible) all the sudden \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe careful, haha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was 2017, haha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha, wow, hahaha um um what was, what do you think the most challenging component of \r\n\r\nBUDS was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAh well I got rolled in um OC-5, uh, that was the first time, I have never felt anything and I \r\n\r\nswear on my lung nothing in BUDS compared to OC-5 and I failed it three times in a row\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree attempts then I got rolled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what\u2019s OC-5?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOC-5 is um buddy um ditch and dawn your gear underwater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, ok\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had three little procedures messed up and that was the best thing that has ever happened to me \r\n\r\nbefore \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell why is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause I absolutely love this class it kinda humbled me a little bit I mean I was passing the \r\n\r\nformer (intelligible) I got rolled and it was kinda getting to love these guys, I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so do you um, what kind of motivated you to kinda have that experience?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, well one you\u2019re here for a goal and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to accomplish a goal, and two its just, you know, I feel like, when, again, playing baseball learning how to fail, it\u2019s just a part of it, part of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, when you got rolled into this class you said it was good, good to know them as people, was there was there support from the group? Talk to me a little bit about the group dynamic \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah so half this class was 338\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, theres probably like 20 of us, and this class had like 59 that are in 338 so having that part of group of friends come in and is just kinda you know 59 originals coming in is a small group so its very easy to mesh \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Um any practices whether they are physical, mental, spiritual that you utilized to get through in general or any specific challenging moments here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, I feel like when we got gassed on the island that was a mental stay in it, stay in the fight, stay in the fight, other than that it was just you take something and you just do it \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow um on that was that like kind of as a group you were doing that or was that more in your own head that you were kinda saying stay in it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was that was something I feel like that is all individual \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean as a group, we got grouped, we got gassed as a group as a class, but as far as individual I feel like everybody had their own mental fight \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get through?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the worst \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the worst evolution in BUDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha, it\u2019s over, haha\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was simulated death\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm, was there any time you had to make a difficult decision during training at BUDS like whether it was for you personally a moral or ethical decision or seeing someone else making the wrong decision and then you had to decide do I say something or not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNone that I can recall. I know one of my good friends quit (inaudible) in first phase, he was rosining the log and I tried to get him not to quit but he ended up quitting but that\u2019s like the only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut other than that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, so nobody kind of taking a short cut or anything like that. Ummm.. Why do you think you were successful during BUDS?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildhood, umm\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about that specifically?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing up just always being rough or playing backyard football or baseball, ya know just \r\n\r\nalways training, always getting outdoors, outdoors is huge. And then, uhh, another thing is just the support of my, if you have support that will literally get you through 99% of BUDS. And also just uhh having an edge, I don\u2019t know I feel like just my own personal mentality, I just wanted to succeed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Umm\u2026 Anything you notice that was different about those who didn\u2019t make it and more specifically those that quit? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. I feel like, not for everybody, but the majority, when I see people quit I think they were in it for the wrong reasons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know, the the glamor of being a SEAL I don\u2019t think they really actually wanted to do the work that the job entails \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm. How did this experience change you as a person? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUm it it really the more you train the more you realize you one you either are actually doing it for the glamorous reasons or you\u2019re actually doing it for the job. I feel like the more I trained the more I actually wanted the job and what its gonna take \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else you that you think I should\u2019ve asked you that I didn\u2019t ask you \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI I think the best question on that is what I believe it was uh what you think I used I think in childhood \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the years of like 0 to 12, 10 or 12 most kids either grow up to play video games or watching way too much TV or outdoors with their dad and doing that type of stuff \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah and do you think that people that are outside \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI really do believe \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it will set their children up for success\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, you have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha when they beat each other to death \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaha yeah encourage that, encourage that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, well that\u2019s it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, Ma\u2019am, thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t12\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Daniel McDonald \r\n\r\nDate: 17 AUG 2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 553\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview:  10:08\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): \r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this your first BUDS experience and when did you start?\r\n\r\nYes started with class 337 \r\n\r\nAnd then you went to 338 or you went to *unintelligible*\r\n\r\nUhhh 338 then 329\r\n\r\nOk and just starting with your personal life, how many siblings do you have? Are they older, younger, girls, boys?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m oldest of three siblings, 2 boys 1 girl. Uhh Girl is the youngest, she is nineteen. I am the oldest. I\u2019m 24\r\n\r\nOkay and then where your parents married, separated or divorced?\r\n\r\nMarried the whole time\r\n\r\nAnd what is your relationship with them?\r\n\r\nUhhh it\u2019s good, really good. Good household. \r\n\r\nDo you have any life changing events that happened to you before buds?\r\n\r\nUh No\r\n\r\nOkay \r\n\r\nWhat do you think your personality contributed to your success at buds?\r\n\r\nUm just keep going um \r\n\r\nOk ok and then describe to me the background that made you want to be a seal. Like did you know anyone that was a seal, were your parents military, did you watch a movie, play a video game?\r\n\r\nUhh I just kind of knew about it. I couldn\u2019t tell you one thing or another. Just when I was young um I knew it was out there and I grew up with, with doing sports and uh I liked the idea of serving.\r\n\r\nOkay, Okay I am going to ask you more about that in a minute but tell me about your childhood. Like When your parents disciplined you, did they put you in a time out, did they spank you, did they take away stuff? What was the norm?\r\n\r\nUmm just time outs I guess.\r\n\r\nokay\r\n\r\nLectures like any other parents would\r\n\r\nYeah \r\n\r\n*unintelligible*\r\n\r\nDid you move around a lot when you were little?\r\n\r\nNope, same house \r\n\r\nSo tell me about your teenage years. Did you play sports? Did you have a tight knit community like boy scouts, were you religious?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m an eagle scout\r\n\r\nOh that\u2019s excellent \r\n\r\nEagle scouts \r\n\r\nCongrats\r\n\r\n I did that\t\r\n\r\n\tThank you. Definitely uh one of my bigger accomplishments I\u2019ve ever done. Um three sports. Football, lacrosse and wrestling. And then I am also a volunteer firefighter so I did that and I am still currently in the program. But I obviously participate in the community\r\n\r\n\tSo which one of these where these all very tight knit communities?\r\n\r\n\tAll very tight knit umm obviously I am sure you already know about the boy scouts. I hold that organization very high. I was in a very good troop. The town I grew up in, good town, nothing really bad happens there so sports are good. Uma and then obviously the fire department is kind of similar to this service community, all that good stuff.\r\n\r\n\tWhat did you do in the last five years of your life prior to BUDS? Like did you go to high school- \r\n\r\n\tUm I\u2019ve been in the navy so-\r\n\r\n\tOkay so \r\n\r\n\tFor six years in May\r\n\r\n\tSo it star- after- so did you go to high school?\r\n\r\n\tMhmm mm\r\n\r\n\tDid you graduate from high school?\r\n\r\n\tYes I graduated from high school\r\n\r\n\tAnd then you enlisted?\r\n\r\n\tYeah like six months off and then got my contract and joined the navy um I went in to be a rescue swimmer. Flying helicopters. \r\n\r\n\tOkay\r\n\r\n\tThat\u2019s what I wanted to do \r\n\r\n\tSo you flew the helicopters or on helicopters?\r\n\r\n\tNo I was on helicopters. Where the crew is.\r\n\r\n\tUm Okay and would you consider yourself impulsive? Like do you binge drink, do you have tattoos\u2026?\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n\r\n\tNo? ok\r\n\r\n\tAnd then what, what was, think of who taught you the most challenging day at buds.  What was that and what motivated you to get through it?\r\n\r\n\tUh I wouldn\u2019t say any day was more challenging or less challenging than any of the others, just \r\n\r\n\tReally? You\u2019re not gonna tell me log PT or hell week after the nap or\r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s like anything\r\n\r\n\tOk\r\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t know um\r\n\r\n\tOkay\r\n\r\n\tOne day at a time\r\n\r\n\tSo what motivated you to push through when you were going through any of those difficult times?\r\n\r\n\tUh just it\u2019s going to end eventually. It\u2019s not going to stop\r\n\r\n\tOkay \r\n\r\n\tDo you have any things that you practice that helped you like uh spirituality or mental things or physical things uh uh meditating anything that you do?\r\n\r\n\tNot really \r\n\r\n\tUm did you have any difficult decisions that you had to go through at BUDS? Like thinking that you had to help run someone out or turn someone in for cheating or anything like that?\r\n\r\n\tUh nah alright someone\r\n\r\n\tI\u2019ve heard a lot of examples so \r\n\r\n\tAlright so I was the LPO of 3 7. Um we had one dude who got caught cheating on the O course and that kinda got blown up and uh I kinda had to do the role of the LPO thing and take care of that appropriately so that was a uh little bit of a fiasco  \r\n\r\n\tSo, so what did you, what was going through your mind when you did that? What, what was uh what helped you make that decision? One way or another\r\n\r\n\tUh obviously my moral values kinda from growing up in all those different organizations and how I was raised from my parents um  what\u2019s what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and how something like that should be handled \r\n\r\n\tMhmm and why do you think you were successful in completing buds?\r\n\r\n\tUm I didn\u2019t stop.  Just kept going. Made the timelines for the evolutions and woke up every day and put my uniform on \r\n\r\n\tLet me ask this a different way- what did you notice about the people who left? Where there any differences where you could say \u201cyeah I knew that guy was going to leave\u201d?\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n\r\n\tReally?\r\n\r\n\tYeah. Yeah I mean some people yeah, other people no. It\u2019s hard to say um I mean I worked with a lot of, uh they are called buds duds, guys who don\u2019t make it and go to other programs right. So my last job as a rescue swimmer, a lot of rescue swimmers are guys from this program. All good- most of them are good guys. Um I would say some better, some not. But say the same thing about guys in the class\r\n\r\n\tMhmm\r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s hard to say um I mean they are all doing a job. I\u2019m sure those guys will put their lives on the line for other people just like these guys who will\r\n\r\n\tDo you think this experience changed you as a person? Going through BUDS?\r\n\r\n\tYes and no. Um I don\u2019t ever think I am ever any different than who I was when I came here uh but I would say I am a better person I guess for going through this, experiencing this\r\n\r\n\tHow how how are you better?\r\n\r\n\tUh just learning more. Every day you learn more stuff, learn more about yourself. I wouldn\u2019t say thought that\u2019s just because of this program. It\u2019s just struggles. Hardships. \r\n\r\n\tOkay\r\n\r\n\tEveryone can go through struggles and hardships different parts of life\r\n\r\n\tSo the Navy hired us to try to get a good feel for what makes people good candidates to go through buds so that it\u2019s not so hard to find people who fit in. What should I have asked you that would help you, help us understand more about BUDS? Like is there something that were missing that were not even asking and you say \u201coh my god if you looked for the people with whatever, that\u2019s easy to see they are not going to make it\u201d\r\n\r\n\tUm I think background have to do a lot of it. Kinda like those questions of what you did growing up and who you are kind of as a person before you even get here right like you want to probably try and attract guys with good moral compasses, good past experiences, um who have already been through some sort of struggle and hardship\r\n\r\n\tOkay\r\n\r\n\tUm \r\n\r\n\tBut you said you didn\u2019t really go through it any hardships before you came here\r\n\r\n\tWell you got all those different things I did right? So like eight years \r\n\r\n\tFirefighter\r\n\r\n\tTrying to become an eagle scout, fire fighter, sports\r\n\r\n\tBut would you say they were hardships?\r\n\r\n\tUm I would say growing up not being that smart in school and having a learning disability so that could be a hardship or\r\n\r\n\tYeah\r\n\r\n\tOr just working with different people. Um I wouldn\u2019t say like it\u2019s any crazy kind of hardship but\r\n\r\n\tBut I it\u2019s interesting that you say good moral compass. How do you think we can tell if someone has a good moral compass?\r\n\r\n\tUm \r\n\r\n\tI I think that\u2019s a good thought\r\n\r\n\tGetting to know who they are without necessarily talking to the person because somebody could tell you what you want to hear. Even like now right? Like you only you only know who I am from what im telling you \r\n\r\n\tExactly \r\n\r\n\tYou wanna kind of *unintelligible* maybe your friends. Kinda like \r\n\r\n\tLike what do your scout master type in\r\n\r\n\tYeah kinda like\r\n\r\n\tFire station\r\n\r\n\tLook at how they do for security clearances, I know that\u2019s probably not feasible but that\u2019s probably the best way to really get to know who somebody is.\r\n\r\n\tYeah this all what we call \u201cSelf report\u201d. You\u2019re telling me everything you want me to know, you could\r\n\r\n\tYeah\r\n\r\n\tMake up something totally \r\n\r\n\tLike you have no idea if any of this is true or not\r\n\r\n\tYeah, right\r\n\r\n\tSo\r\n\r\n\tAnd we are not go verify anything \r\n\r\n\tExactly\r\n\r\n\tEither so I\u2019m going by what you tell me because I\u2019m hoping that you have the altruisticness that you want to help other people \r\n\r\n\tYou\u2019re hoping I have those characteristics already \r\n\r\n\tYes\r\n\r\n\tOf those *unintelligible* that we talked about \r\n\r\n\tYes, absolutely \r\n\r\n\tI would say you know it\u2019s kind of like um what they are starting to do with the program is look for people like that and kinda \r\n\r\n\tYup \r\n\r\n\tPut that at the top rank because you could teach, it\u2019s easy to get someone to run faster or jump or swim um you know it\u2019s kind of hard though to reengineer 18 years of being *unintelligible* so to say \r\n\r\n\tYeah \r\n\r\n\tI mean a guy that would pick up trash you know as a 13 year old boy scout, you know what I mean \r\n\r\n\tYeah I do. Thank you so much\r\n\r\n\tNo problem\r\n\r\n\t I really appreciate this. That\u2019s very help.\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Jesse Hall\r\n\r\nDate: 10Feb\r\n\r\nParticipant #554: \r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 23:19\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): CDR Ledford\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): 554\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright the time is 0913 on 10Feb, this is CDR Ledford and I\u2019m with respondent 554, originally you were 141 initially you opted out and then you came back in again which is great..

Parents, married/divorced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh Married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways married?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow are you with your parents?..close?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh yeah uh yeah...if a son could be closer...I think I talk to em every day, at least 3 times a day\u2026if I can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back through your life, what kind of life-changing events shaped you, any big influences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBig influence..Running, I got into uh competitive running at a s..somewhat early age and dropped all other sports for..for running..I think that is the biggest influence which is its brought a lot of success..and its really boosted my confidence and made me more like strong...I\u2019d say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou said made you headstrong, confidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I would say I was a above average runner for the early parts of my running career and then uhh somethin actually I\u2019d say I looked into, I always wanted to be a SEAL, every since I was little kid  I made like guille suits, went out in the backyard and was just like shooting airsoft and everything and then I looked into the program to see what it was about my junior year...when I went into my junior year of high school, and I was like \u201coh this looks pretty cool\u201d and then ummm I really started putting more effort into my running and then came out my junior year track season with two state titles and uhh a high point trophy from states and it was like awesome. I went to Kokora and SEALFit, a camp that summer, aaand and that was a huge eye-opener..umm and I came...I came from that, and the knowledge I gained from that put into running and I won the following seasons cross country states as well. To this day, I still follow that same mentality I had at that point..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about your personality and how should we view it being successful at BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI always try and keep a good attitude, especially the amount of rolls I\u2019ve had, setbacks...always try and keep a good mentality\u2026.its not worth it if you\u2019re not having fun\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow bout your background with friends, family, SEALs and the military?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh my uncle was Special Forces....my dad state police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow bout your childhood umm your parents pretty strict but their parenting style? Would you get spankings if you rebelled, timeouts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah timeouts spankings, uh got my car taken a couple times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you\u2019d describe them..strict? Probably standard\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d say probably standard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow bout ummm did you have to move around a lot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, weee stayed uh, stay more in town all the time...not all the time but..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeenage years...team sports, ran, track, cross country..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRan track and cross country\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about the 5 years leading up to BUD/s uh up to starting 334, what did you do, walk me through uh what did you do those 5 years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo uhhh I was in high school uh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you go high school to Boot Camp right into BUD/S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to uh one year of college\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSooo one year of college...college where?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhh University of Alabama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright so your one year of college then..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 weeks later\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust decided it was for you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I had uh I was running down the, loved it, but not the running part, I think that running collegiate made fall out of the love of running and\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh went home for christmas leave er christmas break and uh was just thinking...I\u2019m just kinda sittin on the couch, lovin it I\u2019m home with my family, just thinkin there\u2019s so many others...other guy other people who can\u2019t be at home right now. And so I looked into the military more at that during christmas looking into it, and then that following semester talked to a Navy recruiter, and said \u201chey.. I\u2019m interested, I\u2019m in\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy the Navy recruiter right why didn\u2019t you go Army like..SF?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell it\u2019s a funny story, I went into the Navy recruiter and I guess I went a little to early.. They were closed and it started early and my buddy dropped me off so I just kind stuck in the rain. The army recruiter was uh open and he was like \u201chey wanna sit inside until your buddy comes and picks you up?\u201d and I was like \u201cyeah I\u2019d love to\u201d and I started talking to him and he was like \u201cDo you have any family in? And I said \u201cyeah, uncle\u2019s SF\u201d and he said \u201cYou look like you\u2019re pretty fit, do you think you could go SF too?\u201d and I was like \u201cI don\u2019t know my hearts pretty set on uh being a SEAL\u201d and he was like \u201cohh you\u2019re betraying you uncle right now.\u201d and I was like \u201cI am but I\u2019m doing the cooler job soo\u2026\u201d he was like \u201cAlright you sure I can\u2019t change your mind?\u201d and I said \u201cI\u2019m positive\u201d so my buddy came and picked me up and the next day I went to the Navy recruiter and then talked to him, got everything ready, went two weeks after my first year just right to boot camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did you umm why did you think about the SEALs to begin with? Like is it a book, is it a movie, is it friends or?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy uncle always told me cool stories, he did a couple of deployments where he was uh with SEALs aaand so that\u2019s that was crazy..crazy stuff he told me, so as I kid I was always just pretending I\u2019m a Navy SEAL, Navy SEAL do all that stuff...I\u2019d jump out of trees pretending I\u2019m jumping out of a plane. Everything I guess that kind of just translated...up until I went to Kokoro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd SEALFit and I was like this this is what I wanna do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlightly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any tattoos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo tattoos..What do you think the most challenging part of BUD/S, hardest day, hardest thing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting rolled. I\u2019d say getting rolled \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne in particular was more devastating than the other ones?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh this past roll, getting my third phase roll, that was probably the most heart-wrenching one...getting so close and just getting sent all the way back, especially knowing everything you have to redo. That was, the anticipation was devastating. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is tough. Yeah it\u2019s one thing to get rolled at the beginning yeah of phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then you don\u2019t know anything and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing all the way through it\u2019s just like you have so much to look forward to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat motivated you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh just my buddies\u2026 they helped me out so much. They helped me out uh my parents helped me out. And then resetting myself to the point of okay you\u2019ve, you\u2019ve already done it before, you can do it again, and just saying it doesn\u2019t matter the path, just the destination, and so it was like let\u2019s go get it again, I thought that was that was definitely the hardest role, the hardest part I\u2019d say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about practices, did you do anything during the day? Like mental practices, physical, spiritual practices that helped you stay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUhhh I\u2019d say just more meditation, um\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUh everyday I\u2019d get back, this was uh, I started this in 2nd Phase. Every day I would just, I\u2019d set aside 5 minutes, and I\u2019d put I\u2019d put my headphones on, they\u2019re noise cancelling so they\u2019d just block everything out and I would just sit there and think about what happened that day, anything that could be done and if I could have done just what would have been the better route, just kind of just repeat each day and just have that reset every day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you you did that pretty consistently 5 minutes after second phase? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I\u2019d say I\u2019d say every day, other than weekends I\u2019d I\u2019d say every day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you come across a difficult decision at all that you had to make uh something that you really struggled through BUD/S, running classmates out, or turning in a cheating classmate or someone, that you really struggled with?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, I\u2019d say, well there\u2019s one instance in 37 we had a guy who uh skipped an obstacle on the O-course, and we all talked to him about it, and just said hey like he knew that it was a wrong mistake, did it anyways, we all confronted about it saying like \u201cyou know what you did\u201d um but I think that was the furtherst I got with it, was just confronting..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what happened? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm, our officers, they took hold of it and brought it up to the cadre, and he\u2019s not he\u2019s not in the program anymore. I think that was probably the, in relative to those situations I think that was probably the hardest part, because he I liked him a lot, he was a good guy but.. You just can\u2019t do that stuff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think made you successful going through BUD/S?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a tough question\u2026 uhhh a good support system is is huge. You definitely need that. Umm just I\u2019d say that reset every day. Resetting yourself every day, and just kind of tackling the whole day. Tackling each portion of the day I\u2019d say, every meal one meal at a time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything about the people who are not here anymore, the quitters, the people who got rolled, what\u2019s different about them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUmm I\u2019d ss, I keep up with a lot of a lot of the guys that left the program, got kicked out of the program, I keep up them them. And I think they\u2019re still the same guys I went to boot camp with and classed up with and a little more sad, you can tell, but overall they\u2019re still hungry they just\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any difference though between them and the guys that made it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMmm no, they\u2019re still goofy guys, still goofy guys, they\u2019re just the ones that didn\u2019t make it, so..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow about uhh [unintelligable]like has this changed you in any way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, uhh more mature. Umm I definitely take caution with every step I take. And I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like a mixture of kind of tunnel vision and kind of open view, I\u2019d say uh when I\u2019m tackling something I keep that tunnel vision but when you take that step back you still have to take everything in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything else you feel like made a difference that I should be asking you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s just\u2026 keeping your head up. Keeping your head up and remembering why you\u2019re here, why you decided to jump in, how you see yourself in the future, if you can look at yourself in the mirror and still see the same person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate it. Have fun going forward it was awesome this was great we\u2019ll stop there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was cool\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah this was great dude\r\n", "TRANSCRIBER NAME: Andrew Malick\r\n\r\nDate: 12AUG2020\r\n\r\nParticipant #: 557 (557_2020.02.10_09.51_01.mp3)\r\n\r\nLength of the Interview: 19:43\r\n\r\nInterviewer (Code in Blue): Alex Dietrich\r\n\r\nParticipant (Code in black): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterview Guide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's going, OK, and I'll ask you again is it ok if I record?\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s fine.\r\n\r\nAnd would you please tell us your participant I.D. number?\r\n\r\nFive five seven.\r\n\r\nAwesome. OK. So when did you start your BUD/S class?\r\n\r\nMy original class was 334. We got here October 1st, 2018. Been in the program for a little while now then. And then uhh\r\n\r\nAnd is this your first time going through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nStandard Interviewer Question (SIO): So let's go back to your family. Are you an only child, do you have siblings?\r\n\r\nI have four siblings.\r\n\r\nWow, ok.\r\n\r\nYeah. Older brother is 24, then me, just turned 22. I have a younger brother who\u2019s twenty. Then two sisters, they\u2019re 18 and 14.\r\n\r\nAnd are your parents married, seperated, divorced?\r\n\r\nYes. Married.\r\n\r\nHow long have they been married?\r\n\r\nProbably pretty close to 26 years.\r\n\r\nWhat was your relationship like with them?\r\n\r\nI have a great relationship with my parents.\r\n\r\nAnd your siblings as well?\r\n\r\nWith my siblings, yes. We all get along.\r\n\r\nSIO: SO Have there been any life changing events happened in your life prior to BUD/s?\r\n\r\nMy dad was homeschooled all the way up until sophomore year of high school, and I went to high school for three years, graduated and I went to college for two years. I knew when I was in high school that I wanted to come to this. But my cross country coach at the time, I was very close with and who was kind of like a mentor to me. I wanted to kind of find out more about this training and about the demographic of guys who do well. So he contacted one of the NSW Scouts and found out that typically the guys who succeed are like in their young 20s. High schoolers don't normally do so hot. So. So he suggested to me, you know, maybe hold off, don't enlist right out of high school, maybe get a couple of years of life experience or not. Get a little stronger, a little more mentally, more resilient. So I took that advice on board and did a couple of years of community college just to stay busy. And then over those summers, I would go and kind of do something out of my comfort zone. So one summer, I went and worked at the summer camp in Yosemite. So going into that, I didn't know anyone there, had never been to that part of California before, but thought it would be a fun experience. And I thought it kind of pushed me to be better at adapting to new environments. \r\n\r\nSo, and do you think that was effective?\r\n\r\n SIO: So, How did those experiences factor into, or that experience factor into your experience now?\r\n\r\nI think it was effective. I think, I think, I changed a bit, most people do those couple years after high school. And I think that I think that I did better as a result. I don't know for sure what would've happened if I want to come here as 19 year old, but I'm glad that I made that-\r\n\r\n-more mature and getting comfortable?\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah. And then just learning independence and making my own decisions, being away from home. \r\n\r\nSIO: Uhm, How do you think your personality contributed to your progression through BUD/S?\r\n\r\nPersonality meaning\u2026?\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, are those traits that are unique to you, and are predictable behavior, so it could be openness to ideas, conscientiousness, extroversions or introversion, you know what I mean? And agreeableness,  \r\n\r\nRight. \r\n\r\nLike how you deal with stress, or anxiety.\r\n\r\nI think I'm definitely introverted. So... You know, sometimes it's a bit of a grind being around all these dudes, especially, you know, things like on the island were together all the time. There's no getting away from them. But but I tend to also be pretty agreeable. I don't get angry very easily. And maybe as a result of growing up with so many siblings, pretty patient. Yes. And you can kind of take things in stride. So I don't think I really have any enemies in the class\u2026 I haven't gone off on too many people-\r\n\r\n-Even keel. \r\n\r\nRight. I like to be calm and get along with others as much as possible.\r\n\r\nSIO: So, Describe your background to becoming part of the SEAL community do you have any family or friends? \r\n\r\nNo, not really. My uncle was in the Air Force for a little while and my grandfathers were both in the Navy long time ago. But yes, I think since I was a kid, I wanted to go to the military. It's just interesting to me. But I didn't know what I knew I wanted to pursue. I didn't know anything about the SEALs until I was in high school. I watched the movie Lone Survivor. So I was I was very influential to me. I watched it with my best friend at the time. And then after the movie ended, I watched it and I told them I'm going to do that. And he started laughing. He was like, are you crazy? Like everyone in that movie died, like, that was very unpleasant. And uh, But I knew. I knew pretty much since I saw that later, some research I did. I was really drawn to the unity that I saw in the guys that were in that movie, how they were facing an incredibly negative circumstances like, you know, overwhelming force. They all kind of knew what was going to happen. And yet they didn't turn on one another. They didn't go every man for himself, they stayed together. They fought till the end and, I knew I knew I wanted to go to the military. And I knew that I wanted to be part of a brotherhood like that where it didn't matter what was happening. Guys were there for each other. So that was kind of what first turned me on to this program. Then quite a bit of research on my own, and eventually I ended up going for it.\r\n\r\nbiological father?\r\n\r\nStepfather\r\n\r\nStepfather?\r\n\r\nYeah...and uh that introverted side of me has always, I\u2019ve always longed for a community. \r\n\r\nAre you enlisted or officer?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Enlisted\r\n\r\nEnlisted.\r\n\r\nSIO: So going back to your family, and. childhood, we're interested if you could describe your parents like their parenting style so uh, discipline, were you spanked as a little kid uh, free range parenting? \r\n\r\nI've spanked as a kid, but my parents would always sit me down afterwards and let me know why. So it was never you know, there's never any ambiguity about it. I always knew what the reason for my punishment was. So, you know, typically when I was making decisions, I knew whether I was going to be disciplined for it. Other than that, though, my parents were fairly hands off, especially, you know, my mom would kind of.. she wasn't like helicopter parent. Like, I remember we'd go to the playground and all the other kids or moms would be like, hey, you know, be careful on that piece of equipment. Like, don't walk on top of the monkey bars. That type of thing from my mom was never like that. Yeah. She's like, if you walk on top of the monkey bars and you fall, you know, you're going to get hurt. And you know exactly what's going to happen. So if you do that and you get hurt, I'm not going to feel bad for you. So she would, you know, just just let us go and do the things we wanted to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFail in a safe environment?\r\n\r\n[00:08:35] Yeah. She knew we weren't going to die falling off the monkey bars, but we decided to do that and got hurt. That's our fault. So, yeah, it's just kind of maintain that attitude. And even now here she said she doesn't worry about me because she knows that I made the decision to come here and I'm aware of the risks involved. \r\n\r\nSIO: Did you move around in your childhood?\r\n\r\nNo, not at all. I was born in a house that I grew up in. So like a home birth. And I live there. All the way up until grade school-\r\n\r\n-So you were homeschooled?\r\n\r\nNo, not at all. I was born in a house that I grew up in. So like a home birth. And I live there. All the way up until grade school. Homeschooled up until sophomore year of high school. And then that was, you know, even when I would take off over the summers, I still came back to that house. And that's. I was until I left the group camp in May of 2018. \r\n\r\nSIO: And so, did you see any team  sports or activities?\r\n\r\nIn highschool, did track and cross country. So people that I met on those teams and my coach were really positive. And uh,  I love doing sports.\r\n\r\nSIO: What have you done in the last five years prior to coming to BUD/s you mentioned, what was  it,  two years of community college?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes two  years of Community college. And also, at that time, I was working as a server at a restaurant, and then over the summer, one summer, I went to summer camp and worked there, and then other summer I worked at San Diego County Fair. I got an aunt who lives. in Encinita so I stayed at her house over the summer. \r\n\r\nSIO: Would you consider yourself impulsive?\r\n\r\nUmmm, generally, no.\r\n\r\nOk, so  do you have any tattoos you got on a whim, speeding tickets, big purchases?\r\n\r\nNot really. I like to like to typically be pretty informed about the choices I'm going to make. And I like to do my research beforehand. I don't really make any impulse purchases or make any permanent decisions without thinking about it beforehand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: So, thinking about BUD/S, what was the most challenging part of BUD/S? So, a day, event, or it could be just a theme like, logs, or water? \r\n\r\nAll that stuff's challenging, certainly. But I think for me, so I was, uh, originally three, four, and then I got rolled in hell week, for a couple of injuries... and I think kind of making the decision to stay mentally in the game and come back with the class that I ended up coming back with three three seven. That was a very difficult decision because I'd been pretty much all the way through first phase, gone through, you know, a really challenging selection and realizing that I was going to have to start back. They won and no one cared about what I had already finished. That was really hard. Already having seen behind the curtain knowing that all that was coming.\r\n\r\nSIO: What kept you going through that challenge? \r\n\r\nI think just the resolution I had already made that this is where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. I was I was still willing to do whatever I had to do to make it. But it was not an easy thing to accept.\r\n\r\nSo you had made a commitment?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nTo yourself?\r\n\r\nYes, myself and I told my family I was doing this. My reputation is really important. I didn't want to be telling my parents saying, you know, it's too hard.\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\nSIO: So now we're getting the internal motivation and external factors. Did you feel supported by the group?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Yes. I had some friends, both in a previous class and my classes ahead of me two that were really encouraging and helped me... Sort of deal with the challenge of having to come back. A couple of guys who are in this class now, actually, who had already been rolled from 334, for injuries or whatever, that they had sustained during first phase. I knew I was going to be classing up with them. So it was good to have them around during the time that I was rolled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIO: Did you have any practices like physical, mental or spiritual, that you used to push through the challenges?\r\n\r\nYes, I'm a strong Christian, so I pray quite a bit. And also kind of a weird little saying, but, uh something that would just help me stay focused. As I would just say, this is what I'm doing right now. You know, no matter what was going on, if my mind started to wander and I started to wonder, like, hey, you know, it's pretty sweet if I weren't out here in the search zone right now. I would just repeat myself, \"this is what I'm doing right now\". It doesn't matter what I could be doing. This is what I am doing. Just help me calm, stay grounded in the present moment.\r\n\r\n SIO: When you made a difficult decision during training, what went through your mind as you made that decision? Can you give me an example of a decision that you really struggled with during BUD/S? So, for example, running a classmate out, or turning them in for cheating?\r\n\r\nYeah, there's a couple couple of difficult points... There's a good friend of mine and first phase who we ran out of our boat. Really liked him as a person. But uh, you know, wasn't... wasn't able to keep up and other guys in the boat was saying some really negative things to him. And I didn't feel like the words they were saying were really reflective of who he was and what he had shown us about himself, up until that point. But the fact of the matter is, he was born this way. So I didn't personally say anything negative to him, but it was really difficult to see him take that negativity from the other guys in the crew.\r\n\r\nSo what got you through the decision to say, he\u2019s got to go, we got to take action?\r\n\r\nThere's a performance standard and at a certain- most of the time we'll try to help one another. You know, you're lacking in one area, but at a certain point, you see a guy give up on himself. And if you can't help him bring himself to the standard and he's given up on himself and he's done up here, we recognize that in him. And I can see that he was he was out.\r\n\r\nSo that's... Kind of, what\u2019s the greater good of the team?\r\n\r\nYou have to recognize that everyone else in the boat is pulling their weight.So you don\u2019t want them to get hurt.\r\n\r\nBest for the team.\r\n\r\nSIO: Why do you think you were successful in completing BUD/S?\r\n\r\nI think I probably some guys have mentioned sense of humor is important. I think that's a small part of a bigger strategy. I think the reason that I'm still here is just the ability to segment and compartmentalize my mind. I don't think that there's really any evolution in doing this program that every guy who shows up to Coronado could complete. I think, I think everyone who has gotten a contract and made it here could do every evolution from the program. But it's when you start to overwhelm yourself with, \"I'm doing this, which sucks\". And then after this, I know what I'm doing and I know that's hard. And then we have a night evolution, so I'm not going get much sleep tonight. And then tomorrow is a really challenging thing. And you start to just stretch what your mind run away. And those guys end up just quitting on something that, you know, they could easily finish. So I think uh- \r\n\r\nSo, they talked themselves out of it before they even started?\r\n\r\nSo I think I'm still here just because you take things one day at a time and kind of make light of present circumstances.\r\n\r\nSIO: Is there anything, uh actually, has this experience changed you?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I think the biggest thing is perspective on what it means to suffer. I feel I feel a lot older than I am just because when I'm in an area with peers, you know, you know, we go downtown or something and you're around, the 20 year old year olds instantly recognize that they have no idea what it means for the way that we have and they have no idea what they're capable of. We've kind of gotten a glimpse of that through some of the things we've been put through. We realize that our potential is incredible, but there's people out there no idea how much they can accomplish. No idea how hard it can rise. So I think the biggest thing that's changed about me is my weirdness of what you can do when you really set your mind to something. What's possible.\r\n\r\nOkay. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think would be helpful to our study investigating this idea of resilience, heartiness, and mindfulness?\r\n\r\nNo, I don\u2019t think so, I think you\u2019re off to a great several questions.\r\n\r\nOK, so stop.\r\n",

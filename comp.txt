I DON’T HAVE ANY TATTOOS. I’M NOT A TATTOOS LIEUTROPY. I DON’T THINK SO. I THINK THINGS LIKE GET IN YOUR HEAD AND FELT GREAT. THOSE THINGS, THOSE THOSE LIKE FEELINGS JUST GET IN YOUR HEAD AND FETCH. THEY’RE NOT BAD.
UH SOMETIMES. I HAVE MY MOMENTS, YEAH. I HAVE A COUPLE TATTOOS. I GUESS ITS MOSTLY LIKE BUYING STUFF.

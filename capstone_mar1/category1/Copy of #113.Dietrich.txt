A: ya 

113: it was kinda like I don’t know I always go out and try my hardest with pretty much everything I did 

A: describe your background which led to you becoming part of the SEAL community 

113: so when I was 12 years old I wanted to wrestle a tournament down in Virginia Beach and uh just to watch and there was some SEALs there I didn’t really know a whole lot about it, I talked to them and I did the whole pull up thing but I was just a little kid and they told me if I wanted to do it I should do it 

A: ya

113: and I uh started reading about it you know watching movies watching you know just hearing from other people like my friend was a SEAL or my cousin was a SEAL my buddy went to BUDs and I’d talk to them, my neighbor was a retired master chief SEAL so 

A: from childhood?

113: yes from my home town a super super super small town 

A: so tell me a little more about your childhood and I’m particularly interested in your families parenting style uh so this is five siblings right

113: right 

A: what was their discipline like? Was there spanking, timeout, grounding, soap in the mouth, taking away of video games, toys

113: my parents were super free range parenting and they basically let us do anything we wanted until we lost their trust or did something to retract their free range style 

A: spanked?

113: no not really no I've been getting grounded or couldn't go to a friend’s house or stay the night at a buddies or something

A: loss of privileges

113: right right not a whole lot of spankings for my siblings um ya 

A: tell me about your teenage years you said wrestling was big

113: ya 

A: were there any other activities that you were apart of that had a tight knit community or was wrestling  your thing

113: Um, all my friends were into like we would ride bikes and BMX and stuff. I’d always try to have you know like be better than them at that and they'd be better than me at this thing and I’d try to work hard and be better than tham at that, but ride BMX we’d snowboard

A: um when you were ya when you were doing wrestling in college was that a D

113: just a D3 school 

A: okay did it all four years

113: I did it for two years and I ended up not going back for the team

A: okay, um was it did you find it were you dropping weight or trying to stay with it 

113: ya so I wrestled 184 was the weight class I was losing like 10 pounds a week which is pretty average for that level um my coach he’s kinda an old school style he would uh he would set like perimeters for us and we’d be different than the entire school we’d had curfews like our off season like over the summer he’d be really strict on drinking

A: this is in highschool or 

113: college

A: so coach was strict

113: ya very strict very old school mentality he was like 75 76 years old 

A: ok

113: um basically I got tired of it um he was kinda nagging me when I’d go to a party or something like out of season and I was 21 like two years ago and why are you going to parties and I don’t know. You know it was kinda my fault I was kinda a dummy I don’t know 

A: Just normal college 

113: right, you know uh 

A: ok so very strict and controlling 

113: very controlling and very micromanaging and I said you know I’m not gonna do this anymore it’s not for me. I’m gonna focus on going to Buds so that’s what I originally wanted to do to begin with 

A: so they last five years prior to buds you were in the fleet 

113: yes 

A: so anything else happening in that time, things you would do on a down time, leave or travel 

113: I really like to go out and hike like get a couple buddies together and go out to the Shenandoah mountains just relax go shoot go hike, camp stuff like that

A: ok

113: take my friends jeep off road, kinda like fun things to do 

A: would you consider yourself impulsive 

113: at some things I’d like to think a lot of things through but if someone is like do you want to go do this right now I’m like ya sure you know what I mean or you wanna liek can you go help me with this or can you go do this for me like ya or I would pretty much I wouldn;t think it through 

A: spontaneous 

113: spontaneous, ya maybe not impulsive but 

A: uhh do you have any tattoos 

113: yes i have four 

A: ok were any of those spontaneous 

113: uh the one on my right side was 

A: ok, on what was the circumstance of it 

113: um it was four of my friends we were just together, goofing around and talking about like east coast versus west coast mentality we had a couple buddies from the west coast who were the surfer kinda guys and we were all like kinda I wouldn’t say like just like back wood you know I mean like kinda not redneck but country type of style you know we were snooping around in the woods so we got an east coast tattoo on our right butt cheek so that was kinda spontaneous  

A: ok do you have speeding tickets or any other 

113: I have like minor one, I got one in Virginia Beach 3 or 4 years ago in a neighborhood it wasn’t like anything it was just like 35 in a 25 or a 30 or something like that 

A: so nothing else like reckless like that 

113: no no 

A: ok, so what motivates you on a daily basis

113: that's a good question so I wanna be the best at ...Unintelligible… weight lifting or running or swimming or something like that so thinking that waking up their a little bit earlier to warm up ten minutes before trying to do that 

A: when you say you want to be the best is that compared to other people or is it that you want to be better your best self better than you were yesterday 

113: yes

A: yes to both 

113: ya both ya actually so one of my mentors he kinda told me about this one percent rule and I kinda really I didn’t really understand what it meant at first but I it took me a long time to figure it basically said make yourself one percent better every single day when your doing so if your pulling yourself and go back in time the day before what did you do today that you didn’t do yesterday so try to better yourself one percent everyday 

A: what was the most challenging part of BUDs so thinking of the entire experience holistically was there an event or entire day 

113: uhh I think the worst thing for me was chest carrying the log, log PT 

A: ya 

113: I don’t know why um its I thought I had a pretty good foundation in strength but that crushed me everytime  

A: so what motivated you to get through it?

113: um its kinda looking over and seeing other guys suffer to and seeing someone who is 18 19 I’d say maybe 160 150 pounds and their right there suffering right next to me and try not to repeat six years ago you know what I mean 

A: ya umm did you feel like you were supported by the group

113: I did um the boat crew that I had was for the most part solid we had guys in and out but we always tried to win everything so you know being the fastest in the boat being the fasted on the logs so we didn’t have to do the extra PT sometimes we wouldn’t be the best wed always try our hardest but most of the time we did really well so that the uhh the crew that I had would rotate guys out fresh guys in all the time 

A: ok uh what practices, physical, mental, spiritual

113: uh so I do a lot of visualization that’s a big thing for me 

A: ok

113: sometimes it doesn;t work for people 

A: were you taught that here or does it come from somewhere else

113: Ya I learned that here 

A: is there anything else, do you pray or meditate 

113: um I I don’t personally um I probably should honestly

A: do you do anything before physical like stretching routine from wrestling that you brought with you 

113: uh for anything physical I try to do uh dynamic warmup

A: ok, does that also get your mind right 

113: ya exactly 

A: and um when you made, can you think of a time when you went through buds you don’t make a lot of decisions for yourself, did you make any tough decisions? Can you think of an example of one and what was going through your mind when you had to make a decision 

113: umm so ya there there’s a tough one um one of my friends when i was in my original class he was in my boat and we were in hell week and he was super beat up basically more beat up then the rest like physically beat up and we weren’t as fast as we could have been and we were kinda holding back for him and I basically told the boat crew we’re not gonna run him out just cause a lot of that was on me and I didn’t want to see this guy that I worked with for six years get sent home for something that you know at the end of the day doesn’t really matter ya you can I don’t know, he’s physically capable of being an excellent operator but he just had a bad luck bad draw card  

A: so your decision was to hold back the rest of the crew

113: right so I basically made the executive decision that we were not gonna run this guy out of the crew 

A: held back to save um one member 

113:ya 

A: and what was going through your mind and then the big picture

113: the big picture was i’ll take the beatings just as long as he doesn’t leave

A: loyalty to this individual

113: ya exactly and I know for a fact that he would have done the same for and the whole boat crew was on board and the whole boat crew thought he was a good guy and it was the end of hell week it was like Thursday morning or thursday afternoon so we knew he wasn’t gonna quit so 

A: ok 

113: just gotta pull the reins back a little bit

A: why do you think you were successful and then why do you think others weren’t you know what i mean?

113:ya ya 

A: like why did you make it through and what was there something like a trend or in those that failed out 

113: um I think a lot of it is luck um in hard work luck, hard work and just the will to like no matter what and just know that this is your last chance at anything here and you set your entire life you know devoted your entire life to make it through and their gonna have to kill you to get you off ya

A: so for those that failed out DORd or dropped um 

113:they might of had straight up bad luck they could have worked harder, lost that fight, lost that fire like for example bad luck would be broken leg injury or something something that isn’t your kinda out of your hands you know what I mean 

A: How has this experience changed you as a person

113: yes I think so, how, I think I’ve become more introverted than extroverted from when i started 

A: ok

113: maybe the last six to eight months I don’t know why maybe the whole quiet professional thing I’m starting to figure that out 

A: umm so your like internalizing that 

113: yes yes trying to apply that 

A: anything else? 

113: No I think that’s it you 

A: is there anything that I din’t talk about that you'd like to share about this experience that you think would be helpful for grit resilience 

113: um the biggest thing I can think of is it sounds kinda cliche but it’s always gonna end at the end of the day your gonna go home and your gonna take a shower and your gonna eat cause they have to feed you that's if you can just think of that, if i Had thought about that the first time I’m not saying I wouldn’t have quit I kinda go tin my head I would have just thought about that more, I’d probably be in a different spot ya 

A: great ya I’m gonna stop it

79: hockey was like my main 

A: and then you played at uh USNA 

79: yes 

A: which was a D1 program?

79: their a club team 

A: ok 

79: yep ya 

A: ok great umm what have you done is the last five years of your life prior to BUD/s and would you consider um the like any of that to be uh relevant to your experience here? 

79: umm so with the Naval Academy I guess that helped with leadership like team aspect and everything, getting different exposure to different communities and just like seeing where I didn’t want to be and where I’m interested in umm how about that   

A: ok

79: is that 

A: so like summer training at the academy 

79: yes um so I guess SOAS helped 

A: ya 

79: get exposure to it 

A: great, what motivates you on a daily basis

79: just getting just getting better and seeing other guys who are better than me makes me kinda want to push myself to be the best that you can be 

A: inspired by others

79: yes

A: Great, what was the most challenging component of BUD/s uh and this is like a big picture question it could be a specific event or a day or   

79: um 

A: um 

79: probably the first day of first phase or I’d say that um the the the uh first it’s like uh barracks inspections  

A: yep 

79: that was ya 

A: ok what motivated you to push through it 

79: uh just telling myself not to be like uh just the idea of having to call my parents after that and my brothers and stuff and just telling myself I wasn’t soft thats it

A: ok so positive self talk or negative self talk

79: yes uh I well what would that be considered

A: i don’t know

79:uh

A: depends on the narrative in your head, like saying I can do this like 

79: no like so 

A: or are you like 

79: it’s more like don’t be like 

A: be weak

79: ya be weak 

A: um 

79:um

A: and then do you feel like you were supported by the group

79: yes and I think that uh what motivated me so being with the same group of guys that came out from the academy with here 

A: ok

79: like being with them every day helped a lot like seeing them go through the same stuff not wanting to let them down kinda thing

A: ok

79: pretty much not wanting to let them down was probably the biggest motivation piece 

A: ok ya were there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used to push through the challenges?

79: other then just like getting

A: purp meditation like a stretching routine

79:no other than just like preparing before and working out and stuff nothing specific on that one 

A: when you made a difficult decision during training BUD/s what went through your mind as you made that decision, can you provide an example?  

79: umm (long pause) uh I got really nothing sorry

A: ok Would you consider yourself impulsive for example do you have any tattoos? 

79: I do not have any tattoos um but yes I would say impulsive I guess uh I’m just 

A: not not

79: no no i am 

A: oh ya 

79: sort of 

A: Do ah you have speeding tickets? or

79: no

A: ok spontaneous

79: spontaneous I guess ya just kinda if someone says their doing something randomly i’d be like ok ya  

A: is that layed back or is it 

79: ya 

A: impulsive implies you would just um  

79: go and straight

A: doing things on a whim like oh lets go get a tattoo 

79: oh ya alright probably not like super

A: ok so not impulsive but spontaneous ok um when you made a difficult decision ok we already talked about that, no difficult decision

79: I can’t really think it’s kinda all just a blur

A: ok why do you think you were successful in completing bud/s so why were you successful and why do you think others didn’t complete

79: um preparation I think

A: ok

79:a big one 

A: ya 

79:coming from the academy I kinda think we have an advantage form the start because compared to the enlisted guys we have all the prior knowledge about it and knowing people that have gone through the same thing beforehand kinda get their experience from it and can learn from that

A: ok

79: and then also just I think I’m very not necessarily stubborn but I don’t like if I;m gonna do something I don’t want to quit on it I guess so 

A: can I use the word tenacious you know what that means?

79: uhh not really

A: um it’s like you don’t quit

79:ok 

A: right 

79: ya ya 

A: so I like your word stubborn i’m gonna write that down and then I’m gonna write tenacious, ok did you notice anything about people that didn’t make it? What would you say? 

79: I think so not like having their heart kind of in it if their just kinda doing it on a whim I think that those like a lot of those guys quit umm some of it’s probably luck but I think most of it is just I think the majority of people that quit they make the decision ahead that they are gonna quit I think it’s more mental than physical 

A: ok so you don’t think it was a lack of their physical strength 

79: cause all all in around had I think  

A: umm

79: for for mentoring 

A: uh ya how did this experience change you as a person 

79: um it makes you realize things are not that bad I guess but the majority of the time and that you can push through like a lot more than you think you could  

A: so you think that boosts your confidence

79: ya ya you are more confident doing normal tasks or that you’re someone’s asking you to do something that you don’t think’s possible you’re like oh that’s not that hard

A: ok great anything else that you’d like to share that I didn’t ask, ok great, thanks so much.

110: yes you have my permission to record

A: ok, how many siblings do you have 

110: uh two 

A: and what is the birth order

110: um I’m my brothers the oldest, hes 30, I’m 29, I’m the middle and my little sisters 25 

A: ok if you think of your life experiences what might you describe as your crucible or life shaping experiences

110: um besides BUDS

A: yes

110: um ya I think BUDS BUDS is by far the biggest one

A: ok 

110: I have to imagine that will uh be everyone's answer on that question

A: before s

110: before that 

A: childhood teenage

110: oh that’s a good question

A: college

110: ya i mean college I’m thinking if anything stood out as particularly difficult um overall kinda patterns carried out I wouldn’t say there was any sort of 

A: hardship 

110: hardship growing up that I had to do um I did get my pilot’s license um that was pretty difficult   

A: ya 

110: so that was probably one of them but there was no growing up family hardship 

A: ok how did getting your pilot's license or going through college factor into your experiences going through BUDS

110: uh probably the same lessons you get um when you go to college or getting your license it’s applicable to BUDS um you learn attention to detail um you know you learn to both those both college and pilots license are just not something you achieve overnight so it is probably you get out of surveys you are working for a goal for a long period of time and you can't really give up halfway through that goal similar to BUDS so you kinda make the decision to do something and you follow through it um so you know you probably learned a little bit of that um I learned a little bit of that um just gently from written type stuff from having to achieve those long term goals not just an overnight an overnight success   

A: right and how do you think your personality contributed to your progression through buds

110: I don't think my personality changed I think I was the same guy personality wise now

A: ya so to clarify, not how your personality changed but how your personality contributed to your success at BUDS

110: sure sure well I think a big is just my Im pretty light hearted like I I was laughing for 95% of BUDS even when it sucked and that's kinda the same way I've been in life but like keeping a sense of humor with everything your going through everyones in the same situation

A: ya

110: We’re all miserable together so theres something funny about that umm I think ve always be just not I it wouldn't sit right with me if I quit um everything I've done I did in life I’ve just whether it’s my own I don’t want to use the word ego cause that's a negative connotation but for myself you know I wanted to make sure I got through this and did it umm did never give up

A: okay not to put words into your mouth but would you say pride?

110: I would say pride 

A: ya 

110: ya I more pride less less ego I would

A: ya 

110: cause ego is a bad connotation around here but umm but ya my own self pride and self sense of accomplishment 

A: okay describe your background that led you to become part of the seal community

110: hmm mum 

A: um so you could tell me about your childhood 

110: mm ya sure so I I kinda bounced around growing up I lived in a bunch of places umm I born in arizona then moved to new jersey then salt lake city Utah umm

A: were you from a military family

110: I was not but my dads job moved around quite a bit

A: okay

110: so we moved around quite a bit and then umm one of our the one place that was consistent was coronado, we have a summer house here, still do 

A: okay

110: So I’ve been coming to Coronado since I was you know one years old two years old whatever it was so even though like this has always felt like home to me

A: ok

110: I learned about the teams early when I was young umm it was something I always wanted to do but I never really pulled the trigger on it you know obviously I enlisted in the navy at 29, 28 

A: ok 

110: so it took me awhile to get here 

A: yep 

110: umm but

A: but that seed was planted young

110: ya id say so and then I went to college got out of college and started working some desk jobs uhh and just felt overall unsatisfied with what I was doing and Id find everyday I'd be on youtube finding videos on seal teams learning everything I could about the teams so one day I said screw it why am I wasting all this time watching videos why dont why don't I uhh actually follow through with my dreams so kinda quit everything and ran off to join the circus

A: great so if you could tell me going back to childhood uhh about your parents your families parenting style

110: ya 

A: so specifically we are interested in discipline so spanking versus timeout versus withholding toys or video games

110: ya that's a good question my parents were strict they weren't like beat me strict it wasn't like I was getting the belt or anything like that but

A: ok was there any corporal punishment spanking or 

110: uhh no 

A: restraint or 

110: no maybe like no maybe like once in my life they were they were gentle gentler gentler punishers I guess but they were definitely more on the strict side

A: so curfews

110: curfews no obviously no drinking like that growing up 

A: okay 

110: they were very good parents you know I’d had to have good grades in school get into a good college do all that

A: ok and then in teenage years uhh you talked about your moving around did you participate in a team activity or a sport

110: ya 

A: that would have a tight knit community

110: ya I I think any sports team that is a team sport has a tight knit community

A: so did you play any

110: I played basketball uhh in high school 

A: okay

110: I played volleyball as well which in California is kinda law I went to school in arizona 

A: ya 

110: and I ended up playing college volleyball at USC in Los Angeles 

A: so High school and college

110: yep for volleyball

A: was that D1

110: ya that was D1 we were number one in the nation for two years

A: that's great,  congrats 

110: I never played I was a walkon 

A: okay

110: so that probably helped a lot too actually looking at it now just cause I had to be the one first one in the gym last one to leave just to prove that I belonged on that team 

A: ya 

110: cause there was much better talent that they had on the team so the one thing I could really offer was hard work and a good attitude about it 

A: ya ok great, what motivates you on a daily basis

110: uhhh I I would say just trying to better than the person I was yesterday I think I think umm I think lifes in constant quest to get better and if I pay every single day I need to make sure I do something that makes me better than the human I was yesterday

A: ok great what was the most challenging part of BUD/s 

110: um

A: it's a holistic question think about your hardest day

110: hardest day 

A: or the moment where you might have had that 

110: yaa 

A: unintelligible 

110: Monday of hell week

A: monday 

110: about 24 hours into hell week I was having a pretty rough go I was tired cold and hungry I hadn’t quite got into that lizard brain state yet and one of my best buddies who Id spent the last four months with I knew his family his girlfriend he quit uhh  that kinda rocked me a little bit uhh but then I remember we did a very specific evolution called uhh base tour it's this savage like long run with boats on head and it was one of the hardest things of BUDS. That actually kinda kick started me into feeling I was down in the dumps and we did that evolution and I was like hell yea like this is exactly I deserve to be here I belong here and for the rest of hell week I knew I was gonna get through it, it was just that one one crazy evolution that got me through that

A: ya 

110: that pain and that suffering pushed me into that primal state  

A: ya 

110: and I was pumped about it 

A: ya cool uhh okay so is that;s actually my next question is what motivated you to push through so you hit primal

110: ya 

A: and then did you feel like you were supported by the group 

110: I felt like it was a journey that we were all in together but at the same time it’s your own path, the hell week battle it's it’s a big internal battle with yourself as well. You obviously have to rely on the support of the guys around you but there has to be something inside of you that gets through it, you control your fate. I could've chosen anytime to quit or I could've chosen anytime to push through it. You gotta chose it 

A: what practices physical mental or spiritual did you utilize to get through the challenge, do you pray meditate do you

110: honestly I don’t do much of that stuff 

A: ok

110: we learned a bunch of mental toughness techniques uhh for hell week but I think umm ya I mean there was a visualization and I used a lot of that for more technical skill type stuff for example we had this stuff in phase two called OC8. it's a very technical test. I did a lot of visualization at home to get the procedures down right. But as far as Mental toughness you just kinda its hard to put a finger on it I just didn’t quit

A: would you call this chair flying …. Unit. 

110: yea its like chair flying you know the whole going to your happy place and stuff like that didn’t work for me Id go to my happy place and get hit by a wave 

A: haha sure 

110: and get knocked out of it, it didn’t do much

A: when you made a difficult decision during training during at BUDs, what went through your mind as you made that decision and can you provide an example, so were you ever in a tough place where you had to make someone to do something for you and you had the autonomy to 

110: ya the thing about BUD/s is you don’t have a lot of autonomy, every decision you make is pretty much made for you especially throughout you know first phase definitely, second phase third phase a little more autonomy. I would say like a difficult decision if you can go back to hell week that monday night it was the decision of do I stay doing this being in pain hurt and tired then you know for the first and only time in training that I had a second weighed options you know I was like shit if I quit what do I tell my family and those thoughts had never crossed my mind in this pipeline and it was only ten minutes and I was I was challenged and you know you make the decision then and there I’m not gonna let this decision get in my way you know I'm gonna power through it, that was really the only decision you make at BUD/s. Ya I mean there is simple like you know do I go to safety on a pier but just basic day to day decision but not like big life changing decisions that was probably one of them

A: ya great I mean obviously this decision could have been assisted by infinite moments but you didn’t realize or didn’t recognize it was a decision until then

110: ya I mean you always know its in the back of your head but it was a full frontal head on collision that I needed to make this decision right now kinda thing

A: okay so this is gonna sound like another general question but why did you think that you were successful in completing buds and did you notice anything different about those that didn’t make it right so like why you 

110: ya we talked about this alot with the guys around here and our families so I think its gonna sound like a terrible answer but I think a massive part of it is self delusion like tricking yourself into thinking you can do anything

A: those are people who fail

110: why people no no no why people succeed 

A: ohh 

110: right so my theory is like you have to be so good at everything through this pipeline that you gotta be able to run boats for miles on end then you gotta be smart enough to do diving stuff and then safe enough to do gun stuff and no human should really be able to be that good at every single facet of training right your gonna kinda road block at some point during training but if you can trick yourself into training like screw it I can diving I can do gun stuff I can do first phase and hell week and you just telling yourself that absolutely like no doubt in my mind I'm getting through this even if somewhere else statistics are against you and it's gonna such and you’re gonna get through it but if you can trick yourself into saying ya I can do this you can do it, it’s that old quote of those who think they can and those who think they can’t are in both right it’s true, believing in yourself and making sure yourself of making that decision. Does that make sense I know its kinda a weird answer  

A: no it does so we’re talking about confidence about uhh 

110: ya its confidence in yourself but again the whole like its self confidence but a smart person should realize that that there's no way you can get through all this stuff and learn what you need to learn just if you can trick yourself into thinking you can it tends to work out i don’t know that was my problem but probably not the most uhh political answer but you know

A: no 

110: tricking myself into thinking this from the beginning into getting through it is probably how I did it  

A: no its not the best but you did it personally and we’re looking for those raw real answers. So was there what would people do that failed out

110: ya I think bad attitudes I think they when there was pain and suffering and making jokes they were relying on other guys to pick them up I think they just let that consume them and got bad attitudes about I think um overall physical fitness has a big part in it you know I think there's dudes that just ya I its physical fitness does play a role in it but at the end of the day you still have to carry a boat a long way. So you’re gonna have to some level of strength in order to do that

A: so it starts at a low level 

110: ya they really weren’t as physically strong as some guys

A: okay

110: it's tough training you gotta be able to be physically strong

A: ya 

110: and the other one is attitude is not uhh physical mental and then I just it was uhh ….unintelligible…..ya I can’t express what exactly what it is I think attitude is a big thing like you choose if you make it through the program or not like a lot of people who don’t make it through or have excuses they their hurt or injured or the day it was cold that day so that's why I didn’t run as fast they throw out bullshit in my opinion like you are the one that decides if you get through or not and you guys even hit on it in your surveys there's like 11 12 questions if I see a roadblock in my way who has control of that and the answer for most the guys here is I have control the example I use is it starts on that 20 percent that make it through training or whatever it is and people are like oh that's terrible how are you gonna make it through its 20 percent the odds aren't 20% it's not like I got a five sided coin and I get lucky you literally control whether you make it through this or not so in my mind you have a 100 percent chance of getting through cause you are the one who decides they don't decide for you. IF you perform and you do what they say and you just get through it you're gonna make it through and its as simple as that

A: so umm 

110: bonus question, extra credit what is this 

A: um how did this experience change you as a person, are you changed is what I should so how

110: ya I'm more proud of the guy I am now than when I started I would say I wouldn’t say it made me tougher I wouldn’t say anything like that I feel like it brought out qualities I had and gave me a chance to test those qualities sense of humor stayed the same you know and I’m just happy, im generally a happy guy I don’t get pissed off a lot I’m just here to have a good time and make some friends uhh do some really cool job 

A: does this opportunity to test yourself improve your confidence, do you think your confidence has gone up?

110: uhh it’s good to confirm obvious like you know, it’s good to confirm it would save time I just I don’t know ya it helped with confidence I guess but I kinda I felt like I was trying to get through the training before I came in here 

A: okay

110: I didn’t come in saying oh I may or may not make I came in knowing I was going to get through whether that was self delusion or what it works

A: anything else you'd like to add?

110: no that's it

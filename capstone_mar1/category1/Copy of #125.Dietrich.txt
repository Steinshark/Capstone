125: i I had a lot of that I mean as an only child my mom was  pretty um oh babying of me like coddling a little bit but my dad was just is from one of seven or something so there’s no holdbacks

A: Tell me about your teenage year like did you uh participate in a team sport or activity that had a close knit community

125: I ran cross country in highschool I played lacrosse as well and then I did club lacrosse on the outside and i was on like a swim team when I was in middle school but that’s preteen I guess 

A: ok, did you play for the Academy 

125: No I did not, I rowed for the first year, light weight crew and then did not really I mean Patrick did that and stopped doing that after plebe year

A: ok ok anything else like either theatre or band or 

125: I love music umm I’m not I used to play the drums umm I got reasonably good at that and then I went to the academy I couldn’t obviously bring a drum set up there and then during TAD time I picked guitar    

A: ok but anything with like tight knit community

125: oh no 

A:um so in the last five years of your life you graduate you were a Tad anything else, travel 

125: oh we did a bunch of traveling just like a bunch of vacations

A: personal 

125: Personal ya but some of my buddies went to peru iceland um italy Germany LREC from the academy 

A:ok

125: um and 

A: um Do okay do you consider yourself impulsive

125: sometimes I get into kinda like weird waves of um like I’ll be very frugal for a while and then whatever I’l like treat myself kinda thing  but I see myself as of saving up for like certain things like for all those trips I would save up for awhile and kinda like oh stay away you know even the odds for a little while

A: uh ok, do you have any tattoos?

125: I do not

A: how about speeding tickets

125: uh not none on the record

A: ok just warnings, what motivates you on a daily basis

125: honestly it’s what I was saying earlier with the guys like I’m living with you know you try to sleep in one day and they are in your room yelling at you calling you names and stuff, it’s kinda cool 

A: ok

125: it sucks but it’s kinda cool at the same time

A: ok, cohesion

125: cohesion too and then ya just like trying to keep the family proud and everything as well cause my dads’ side is very tight knit

A: ya

125: um and involved with messages and everything and everybody knows everything

A: ok, what was the most challenging thing about bud/s so like looking at your time here, your experience here what was the hardest and uh it could be a day or an event 

125: so I hate the cold so that was bad for me

A: oik

125: uh I think what was probably the worst was life saving for me uh I just had I like saving an instructor and I had to grab a big guy like and I kicked him in the groin accidentally and he was not not too comfortable with that um so usually you swim to the otherside of the pool and he meets you half-way and he chased me all the way across the pool and then some so I’m seeing stars by the end of that about to pass out uh whole life saving and just like everyday grind

A:ok everyday

125: it started to add up 

A:ok so when it got hard what motivated you to push through

125: um on a daily basis it was just like I can’t wait to go to my bed 

A:ok 

125: and then I’d just keep saying in my head the faster you go the faster you’re done

A:ok

125: kinda deal so I’d do that for runs um for swims and all those like like earned yourself a little break here and there

A: ok 

125: and that just helped me a lot 

A: were there any practices physical mental or spiritual that you used for the daily challenges 

125: um I would do I’m catholic so I’d like pray every night kinda deal 

A: ok you’d pray 

125: nothing insane, just before  I go to bed 

A: do you do like rosary or like 

125: no I just like in my head kinda thing   

A: do you do like meditation or stretching routine where you do something physical 

125: um I would stretch um I would start getting like kina hip pain a little bit so I would have to stretch out my hip spend a little more time at night doing that

A: ok

125: and then just hitting the verbal way harder whole friend group was just and like 

A: so like a team psych outs 

125: and then my roommate and I back in first and second phase um it was just communal complaining just lets you see a funny side of stuff kinda makes you less angry there’s that so   

A: ya ok ummm so like like a vent session 

125: essentially 

A: um come from the academy with a sense of 

125: definitely

A: ah did you make any tough decision while you were training at buds and if you did what went through your mind when you making a decision 

125: tough in like 

A: like you were faced with something and you said uhh I gotta decide whether to do A or B and I’m having a hard time with both of them 

125: nothing nothing monumental like or earth shattering stuff but there’d be times when you're running on skill and jump in the ocean but since you’re already wet you don’t need to cause they won’t notice kinda thing umm and and you would get back faster and it paid if you got back faste they’d be like ok you guys go you’re good and keep the slower guys so there was kinda that      

A: so the temptation to cut corners

125: right ya 

A: so what went through your head and what did you decide 

125: umm well the first time the round we were in BO um I like did did the whole I’m already wet I can turn around 

A: ya 

125: um and then kinda thought about it and then some of our friends were like hey man you you didn’t even do it not the second time we’re already wet just gotta do it 

A: ya 

125: so I just thought about that and stopped and then um ya just the the knowing that as it comes as we used to say as an officer or whatever people are still looking at you so kinda keep it good professional 

A: ok uh why do you think that you were successful in completing buds and why do you think others didn’t

125: um I think coming from the academy we knew a little more what to expect you are around it more I had pretty good resources um Rick Joslin over in the leadership hall he’s really good at kinda giving us insight 

A: ya 

125: and helping us out um and then I had my family that I reach out to as well

A:ok 

125:just really good community personal face

A: ok 

125: which was great 

A: ok 

125: uh and then just going back to the personal traits from whatever I said earlier, um I forgot what I was but I think that helped out 

A: ya so what about the people that didn’t make it through  

125: I think again they probably didn’t have the good exposure like knowing what to expect like they show up these big meaty guys and thinking they're gonna throw logs and boats around and it’s a lot of running and stuff and then the daily grind can be is more than just what they account for I think they catch people off guard and the younger guys I’m sure it’s a maturity stand point and they’re more focused on the near and now which like I definitely couldn't do this at 18 so guys that do um just everyday I’m impressed by that um I think the guys sometimes come for like the wrong reasons too like I wanna be cool or whatever or just watched to much movies umm ya I think it;s a big one and  a lot of people just sometimes they hurt themselves and that catches up pretty quick 

A: ok do you think this experience has changed you as a person

125: I think so 

A: how 

125: Uh I think I can handle stress pretty well now like it doesn;t shock shock and awe as much

A: so better coping skills 

125: better coping skilling and I think the word they were using was compartmentalize just kinda like break down problems as they rather then focus on the whole deal like um like cluster you’re in at the moment um I think it’s cool seeing like it was not fun at all or anything but it was cool seeing how much you can go through and still go um physically and um not sleeping for a while 

A: so like confidence

125: confidence so like physical confidence whatever knowing that you can do it if you had too is a nice nice fall back 

A: ya anything else that I didn’t cover that you wanted to share or that you think we should cover 

125: not really 

A: I’m gonna hit stop 

125: ok

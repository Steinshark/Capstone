Dr. Patti:

Okay. So, what is your number for this study?

636:

Number 636.

Dr. Patti:

636, okay, awesome. So, we're gonna s- talk, uh, first about, um, if you could just tell me a little bit about your background, like, things like, you know, did you grow up with both your parents, did you have siblings, where are you in the birth order, blah, blah, blah, that kinda stuff.

636:

I, I did grow up with both my parents.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

Um, I have two older brothers and one younger sister.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

And, um, we moved around, but we just mostly just moved around in the state of North Carolina.

Dr. Patti:

Okay, um, so, how... what's the age gap being?

636:

So, my oldest brother's 31 years old, then my other brother is 30 years old, then my little sister is 14.

Dr. Patti:

And you are?

636:

I'm 21.

Dr. Patti:

21, okay. All right, awesome. So, it's kind of-

636:

It's a little spread out, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... the regul-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... regular family, everybody there together, okay. And then, um, you moved around some. Um, uh, uh, within the state of, uh, h- North Carolina.

636:

North Carolina.

Dr. Patti:

But did that cause you to have to, like, change schools or anything like that?

636:

Um, I did change schools. Yes, ma'am, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And was that-

636:

Um...

Dr. Patti:

... easy, hard?

636:

So, I first moved when I was in the fifth grade. So, all the kids that I grew up in elementary school with, I didn't have going into middle school.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

So, I made new friends in middle school. And then I moved again in the 8th grade, so the kids that I grew up with in middle school-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Yeah.

636:

... I left them and I made new friends when I went to high school.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

636:

But, um, I was a usually pretty... I wasn't socially awkward, for the most part, so I didn't mind makin' new friends, and I'm actually kinda glad that I did. 'Cause I still keep up with everybody, so-

Dr. Patti:

Well, that's cool.

636:

... you know, social media nowadays, you can do that.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

636:

So.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, that's cool.

636:

I still keep in contact with everybody, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, so, that's nice. So, then, in high school, did you, um, play any sports?

636:

I played, um, football, basketball, and baseball, so the s-

Dr. Patti:

The three all-American sports.

636:

... The three, yeah, the three.

Dr. Patti:

And did you play them all the way through high school?

636:

I did. Yes, ma'am.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, wow. That's kinda cool.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Good for you. And then, but then after high school, did you go to college, or did you consider that?

636:

Um, I went to a community college.

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

636:

Um, it was free, so I thought I'd give it a shot. So, uh, I did that, and I just didn't really, um, enjoy. Maybe 'cause of the community college, and some of it was online, I just didn't really-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

636:

... get a lot out of it, didn't enjoy it. So, I decided to enlist.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. All right. We're gonna get more about that in a second. So, then, in the five years, I guess, um, oh, wait, hold on. Take... I retract that statement. Tell me, if you would describe yourself using some personality traits, how would you describe yourself?

636:

Um...

Dr. Patti:

You were a friend.

636:

I'd say I'm pretty outgoing.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

Um, I'm hard to anger, but once I get there, um, I get pretty out of control, but-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs)

636:

... I usually don't get... I'm kind of calm, for the most part.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

636:

But, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And one more.

636:

Um, I'd say I'm, I'm hard-working, um, if it's something that I wanna put my mind to, and I'm really focused on it, then I'll work hard for it.

Dr. Patti:

Then work hard on it, yeah. If it's not something you care about, you probably-

636:

Yeah, yeah. I'll lost interest.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Right. Yeah, like many of us, I think. Okay, so, then, in the five years before going... coming to BUD/S, what kind of training did you do, you know, to prepare, and, you know, did you think about it-

636:

Um...

Dr. Patti:

... for a while, that kinda thing.

636:

I honestly came into BUD/S unprepared I'd, I'd say. Um, well, I decided that I wanted to be a SEAL, or attempt to, uh, probably like a year and a half, um, before I actually enlisted.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

So, I went to the recruiter, got everything done, and then, um, so, I DEPPED in in March, or, no, in February.

Dr. Patti:

You what?

636:

DEPPED in.

Dr. Patti:

What's that mean?

636:

It's the Delayed Entry Program.

Dr. Patti:

[crosstalk 00:03:49] Oh, oh, delayed entry.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. DEPPED in. Okay.

636:

Yeah, Delayed Entry Program. Yes, ma'am. So, I did that in February and, um, I took a PST in March. And, um, I passed.

Dr. Patti:

That's the five event thing. The swimming-

636:

The swimming and stuff.

Dr. Patti:

... pull-ups, push... Okay.

636:

So, I passed, but the scores weren't as low as I wanted them to be, or, as good as I wanted them to be. So, I wanted to retake it, but with COVID, everything started closing down, so I didn't take another PST until June.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

So, I passed that one, I got my contract.

Dr. Patti:

Did you get it... was it higher or better-

636:

Yep. It was-

Dr. Patti:

... [crosstalk 00:04:22] more like you wanted? Okay.

636:

... Yeah. And, um, got my contract, and had a, a date to leave December 7th. So, I trained all the way until Dec- December 7th and I was in really good shape. So, then, with bootcamp now, they quarantine us for 14 days, two weeks. And, uh, so, I did that, and on the 12th or 13th day, we got COVID tested. And, um, so, we were split up into four quadrants, like, four people per quadrant, and a kid in my, uh, quadrant tested positive.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, God.

636:

So, I had to do two more weeks. So, that was... yep, that was four weeks.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

636:

Doing nothing. So, that, obviously, took a lot out of me. And, um, then we got the boot camp, and there's not much we can do there, 'cause we didn't have the 800th division anymore, which is-

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

... where they take you to the pool and they let you run every day, and we didn't have that. So, for about a month, two months, I was doing nothing.

Dr. Patti:

You were just-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... so, it was, like, almost three months, right?

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

'Cause it was four weeks of the COVID.

636:

Yep.

Dr. Patti:

And then boot camp's eight weeks, right?

636:

Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

So, three months to get out of shape.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And, and boot camp's not enough, I wouldn't think.

636:

No, no. But we did have prep, and that got me in really good shape too, so.

Dr. Patti:

Mm.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That was once you got here.

636:

Yep. Well, w- I had prep in, uh, Chicago. My prep was in Chicago.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

636:

Yep, they d-

Dr. Patti:

So, then, you felt like you got in better shape there.

636:

... Yeah, I did, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And then, um, how do you think, like, the experiences that you had before you came into the Navy affected your, you know, performance, outlook, thoughts, whatever on, on BUD/S?

636:

Mm, I kinda really had... didn't really have a hard childhood or anything like that.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

I kinda just grew up in an ordinary family, kinda everything was smooth sailing. I didn't really go through a lot of hardships, honestly. Um, but, yeah, really, I, I don't know. Uh-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. (laughs) Made up for it in BUD/S, I s-

636:

... Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... I bet.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Um, so, then, the other one is, like, describe your background that led you to the Navy. You know, did you play sports, did you have a family member, did you know of, I mean, like, h- how did you know, "I wanna be a SEAL?"

636:

Um, actually, my dad was a SEAL, so.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, really?

636:

Yeah. But he went [SHVN 150 00:06:44], so, then, he retired about four or five years ago. He had 30 years in, so.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

636:

Just, uh, it was pretty, uh, high up in the...

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, how does that feel, like, from your perspective, though?

636:

It don't feel good, you know, uh, uh, obviously, but, I mean, it's... I can't do anything about it now.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, but, I mean, like, I guess, before, before you s- quit, or stopped, or whatever, we'll get to that in a second.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That gives you kind of a different perspective, right.

636:

Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.

Dr. Patti:

If your dad already did it and, you know, like...

636:

Yeah, uh, uh, I had taken advice from my dad and, um, you know, BUD/S has changed a lot. So, you know, really, his, I, I appreciate his advice, but, honestly, it didn't really do me any good, 'cause-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs)

636:

... he went however many years ago through BUD/S, and it's changed a lot since then.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, right, absolutely.

636:

It's more focused on, um, performin'. Back in the day it was just, you know, not quit, you know, you'll be all right. Now, we have to perform every day.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, right.

636:

And you're, you're pulling, like, 23, 22 hour days.

Dr. Patti:

Yes, and, [crosstalk 00:07:51] and they keep changing the standard and making it harder.

636:

Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

And, yeah, it makes it really, really tough, yeah. So, um, so, your dad, did he do a career in the military?

636:

He did 30 years.

Dr. Patti:

So, uh, but you stayed, managed to stay in North Carolina?

636:

Mm-hmm (affirmative), yep.

Dr. Patti:

Oh. I didn't even know they had SEAL teams in North Carolina. I thought they were-

636:

Yeah, he... it's in Virginia.

Dr. Patti:

... Oh.

636:

But he stayed in, uh, East Coast of North Carolina and he drove an hour to work.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

636:

For, uh, my older brothers, so they could go to a smaller school that he's heard about with, um, a good, tight-knit community, the high school and everything, so.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay. Hm, well, that's nice. I mean, I guess that's... Okay. So, then, um, while you were at BUD/S, um, can you just tell me what happened? Like, why... how did you end up not making through, or what was your...

636:

Yeah, um-

Dr. Patti:

I mean, I don't know anything about you, so.

636:

... Yeah, so, the first week, it went, it went good, you know. Um, I was performing well, I was in the middle, in the middle of the pack. And then we lost a lot of people in the first week. So, the second week started and, uh, and I just-

Dr. Patti:

And this is phase one we're talking about.

636:

... Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

First phase. So, obviously, more people are gone, and a lot of the studs are still there, obviously. I'm not... I wouldn't call myself a stud, I was just... I'm average.

Dr. Patti:

Just regular guy.

636:

Yeah, I'm just average. So, all the studs, you know, they're running a lot faster and I, I'll sit there, more people gone, I started gettin' noticed more, 'cause I'm more towards the back of the pack.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

So, uh, that's really what happened with everybody. Then the instructors see that, and then they just zone in on that one guy who's towards the back.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

Then they, uh, [inaudible 00:09:24]. So, that was my sec- the second week, was kinda getting tortured. Not tortured, but, you know-

Dr. Patti:

[crosstalk 00:09:28] Like, what do they do to you, uh, if you're at the back of the pack?

636:

... Um, they just like to insult you a lot.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

And that stuff don't bother me, but, um, during logs and stuff, instructors like to get hands-on too, um, apparently, nowadays. Now they'll come and they'll slap you, and, like, push you off the logs and stuff like that.

Dr. Patti:

Just to kinda make you think about it, I guess.

636:

Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Okay, so, that was the second week. So, you were still hanging in there the second week. Now we're into the third week.

636:

Well, I'm... I was done on Friday of the second week.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

636:

So, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

So, what happened?

636:

So, we were doing logs and, um, they just pulled my crew aside, and, uh, they just kept, uh, torturing us and, like, [inaudible 00:10:10]. So, I, I mean, we're all struggling, and I guess I was, like I say, I'm on a log with a bunch of beasts, I guess you could say, and I'm average, so I was struggling a lot more than everybody else. So, everybody on my log, which I thought were my teammates, were telling me to quit.

Dr. Patti:

Ah.

636:

And they were like, "You're just hurting me," which every, it hap- it's not just me, it happens to, it happens to a lot of kids-

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

636:

... who are just average. They get told to quit by who they thought... someone that they wanted to, to work with. And, you know, go to war with.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

And then they're just telling you to quit and just give up on yourself. And that, and the instructors, so I was like, "I'm just hurting everybody else at this point," so.

Dr. Patti:

Were you hurt, like, physically hurting? Like, did you have something that hurt, or?

636:

No. Tired.

Dr. Patti:

Just tired.

636:

I mean, obviously, like, everybody feels the muscle failure, everything like that, pretty much.

Dr. Patti:

So, if you had it to do over again, what would you, would you have done the same thing?

636:

If I had to do it over again, um, before I enlisted, I'd probably lift weights more.

Dr. Patti:

Huh.

636:

'Cause, um, before, I just did calisthenics and body-weight stuff, 'cause I didn't wanna gain a lot of weight. 'Cause, I mean, BUD/S is a lot of running.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

So.

Dr. Patti:

But you would've lifted more weights-

636:

I would've, I w-

Dr. Patti:

... so you were stronger.

636:

... Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And that would've helped you more, I guess, on the log PT.

636:

Yeah, on the log. Everything else I was fine, just logs was struggling, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Really? That's interesting. But you were fine with the obstacle course.

636:

Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And flipping your body over that-

636:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... crazy, giant thing.

636:

Yeah. Yep.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, that's, that's... it's so interesting. I mean, it's so cool. So, would you, then, consider coming back to BUD/S?

636:

Um, I don't think I'd ever come back to BUD/S, honestly.

Dr. Patti:

You don't think so?

636:

Mm-mm (negative). Well, I've thought about it, but I got a new job sheet and I... they didn't give me anything where it's easy to come back.

Dr. Patti:

What did your... is your new job?

636:

Um, I chose... I'm gonna choose air crew.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

Yes, ma'am.

Dr. Patti:

So, you'll be, like, on a aircraft carrier, or...

636:

Um, it's, I think it's 50/50. I could be in a hangar on-shore.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And you'll work on the aircraft or you'll, um, send 'em off?

636:

That's different, um, I think that's different [inaudible 00:12:12] jobs that comes with air crew. Um, that's... could be a, a co-pilot-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

... to the, um, officer who's flying the aircraft. Um, you can do search and rescue, kinda, little bit humanitarian stuff.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

Stuff like that. And you could also work on the aircraft.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, wow, that's cool. And you must have a pretty high score, so you-

636:

It's decent.

Dr. Patti:

... can choose, you know, the-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... the good, the good jobs, you know.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You're not stuck being a-

636:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... cook, or a floor mopper-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... or whatever.

636:

If I would've gotten airpac or something like that, with that, that's a, that's a job that you're still on rated, so it's easier, you can come back within a year.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

You can put in packages to come back, so I probably would've done that if I would've got that, but I didn't. Which is okay, but I could... I can still do six years and come back. So, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

If you want, right.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You don't have to, but if you like your job, then you keep it.

636:

Yeah, exactly.

Dr. Patti:

And if you don't, you can c- always come back.

636:

Yeah, I've thought about coming back and, and just doing SWCC.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

Just to, just to experience that and, you know, see the difference between BUD/S and SWCC.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

So.

Dr. Patti:

I don't think SWCC is a cakewalk either, though.

636:

No.

Dr. Patti:

I interviewed a guy yesterday from SWCC and I was like, "Whoa."

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

I, I, I didn't even know what SWCC was, so, I don't know.

636:

Yeah. It's not a cakewalk. It's, it's a l-

Dr. Patti:

No, no, it's-

636:

... it's different. It's... the training's different, but...

Dr. Patti:

... It's different, but still hard.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

None of it's a cakewalk. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, then, while you were going through BUD/S, did you do anything to kinda help you get through. The moment, like, when you're freezing or you're, you know, sucking, doing whatever, was there any sort of mind games you played yourself to kinda help you through it?

636:

Um, yeah, I thought about my family a lot.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

Obviously. And what I used most is, "It's gonna be over sooner or later," you know. I'm gonna be in a warm shower in, like, an, in, like, an hour maybe, you know.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

636:

But, yeah, it'll be over. And just, I just go from some chow to chow, from lunch to dinner. From, if we had something in the morning, and I'm like, "Well, like, they're not gonna let us not eat," so I would have breakfast, uh, just from this time to that time.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

And then from after breakfast from, let's see, we're done with breakf- around seven, so, from, like, seven to eleven.

Dr. Patti:

Yep.

636:

And then from eleven to some-

Dr. Patti:

Right, yeah, you just-

636:

... four o'clock.

Dr. Patti:

... one little chunk at a time.

636:

Yeah, just one little chunk at a time.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, yeah. That's a, that's a, that's a great strategy, though. Um, now, do you think that being, coming to BUD/S made you... affected your personality in any way or changed you-

636:

Um...

Dr. Patti:

... in any way?

636:

Yeah, but I think it's for the good. Um, I don't regret comin' and attempting this at all.

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

636:

Like I said, I l- I learned a lot from it. Um, I know what I'm capable of now that I never thought I would... even though I didn't make it all the way through.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

636:

I did the first two weeks of what I did, um, it's a lot more than kids who are not in the military.

Dr. Patti:

Yep.

636:

They just, you know, my friends ask me about it and I'm, I'm just don't even explain it, 'cause it's hard for them to understand, 'cause you have to be in there to under- understand exactly what goes on-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

... in BUD/S. But I wouldn't change it for the world and, honestly, I'm, I'm, I'm glad that I'm attempted it, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

636:

Um, has it changed me? Um, I guess, I'm probably more, a lot more competitive, honestly.

Dr. Patti:

Really?

636:

Uh, yeah. I'm probably... once I choose a job, then I'm gonna work as hard as I can to be the best at it. So, I do not, uh, I don't wanna fail again.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

So, I have a more intense mentality, I would say, now.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, because you don't wanna fail.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

In whatever, yeah, I guess when you've gone through something like this, it really-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... motivates you to-

636:

[crosstalk 00:15:48] But I also know my limits and I can push myself a lot farther than, you know, e- everybody can push themself farther than what they think they can.

Dr. Patti:

... Right, right. Yeah, that's the thing of the-

636:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

... military schools.

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Like, I felt the same way, yeah. That you, you, you s- had no idea you could actually do that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, and then, um, what do you think is different about the people that, that made it versus the people that didn't make it? Just from your little perspective in the world?

636:

Um, more prepared.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

Just physical freaks. A lot of officers, you know, petty officers, um, make it. Um...

Dr. Patti:

You mean, like, they're physical-

636:

They're physically just-

Dr. Patti:

... freaks.

636:

... Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

So, like, LeBron James is a-

636:

Yes.

Dr. Patti:

... physical freak, yeah.

636:

Yeah, pretty much.

Dr. Patti:

Okay, I see what you mean.

636:

They've been working for this for, you know, h- forever, for their life, for 40 years, however long, like, compared to some kids that's working out for just a year trying to-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

... prepare.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

But...

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know. How many years can you work on it, but-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... (laughs) you know. Um, and then, here's the question where you have to think a little bit. And that is, um, so, we're asking all these questions, we're trying to understand better what, you know, what, what causes people not to make it.

636:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

You know, is there anything we could instill in the process that might be helpful, so. But are, are there any questions you could think of that we could ask that we're not asking that, that might help us understand it better?

636:

Um, a good question would be asking the comradery between your class.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

Like, did your class come together? Or did... were they all up against each other? Were they just, um, "I'll get mine, you just get yours kinda thing."

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

Did they have that mentality. Or did your class all come together and say, "Hey, we're in this, all this, together."

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

636:

"If you're not good at one thing, then don't tell me to quit."

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

"'Cause you could be useful in something else that-"

Dr. Patti:

Absolutely.

636:

"... [crosstalk 00:17:51] along the line."

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

So.

Dr. Patti:

Like, with your height, I would think-

636:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... that'd be really useful in some things.

636:

Exactly.

Dr. Patti:

And, and a down thing on others.

636:

Exactly.

Dr. Patti:

But, so, um, would you say... were you class 351?

636:

351.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. Would you say that your class came together or didn't come together?

636:

We, yeah, our class, that's one thing that I didn't like about our class. We, we had no comradery, any, anything, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. And do you think that was from, uh, leadership or, like, y- you know, what, what, w- why?

636:

Um, I think it comes from, you know, the instructors. They get in your head, and then they kinda make it seem like, um, they, they're so big on performance, that everybody's just worried about their own performance.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

You know, they're not helping anybody else, you know, perform if they're struggling, help them out a little bit.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

636:

You know, they, they just... when someone's struggling, and that means, like, under a boat or under a log, someone's struggling, that just means everyone's struggling more, 'cause you're carrying more weight. And instead of, my class, realizing that we can help 'em out a little bit, push 'em through, they just, you know, their mentality just switches up, and they get all mad and angry, and then they're just like, "Just quit already. I don't want you here."

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

636:

So, my class was pretty bad with not... and it comes with the officers. You know, they're the... mostly the leaders of the-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

636:

... of the, um, of the class, and they were nice guys, but, uh, they m- they mostly cared about themselves, so.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right. Yeah, I... you're not the only person I've heard that from, so.

636:

Yeah. It's disappointing, but, like-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, I think that's all the questions. Let me just stop this here.

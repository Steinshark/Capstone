Dr. Miles:

Okay. So what's your number?

642:

Number 642.

Dr. Miles:

642. All right. So I'm gonna ask you a few questions, like I was telling you. Um, and the first question I wanna ask you is if you could tell me a little bit about your childhood, you know, where are you from? Like what kind of a family, parents, siblings, high school, blah, blah, blah.

642:

Okay. Um, so I'm from Columbus, Indiana. And, um, I have, um, a twin brother, um, and then two older siblings as well. So there's three, three siblings. And, um, we're pretty, uh, well, my sister's, uh, she's like 13 years older than me. So, um, she, she's kind of always been someone I could, uh, look up to, um, as a figure of like where to go and stuff. And then I've always just kind of had my brothers that, uh, we just grew up together and got along with. Um, and then, um, I was always a big soccer player.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

So that's what I spent most of my life doing. And, uh, my other siblings weren't really, um, soccer players, but we all played, at one point, we all played like three different sports. Um, but I ended up sticking with soccer and, uh, they did other things as well. Um, and then, so yeah, I went and played in high school, um, and then-

Dr. Miles:

Played soccer in high school?

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Correct.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

And then, um, um, I got, I got pretty good at that. Um, uh, and then from there I went to, uh, I started thinking about, uh, what I was gonna do with my life after that. And I started thinking of, uh, joining the Navy to do SEALs and stuff like that. But, um, uh, my parents talked me in waiting and making sure I wanted to do it and they thought I better get a degree first, in case I, um, have something to fall back on.

642:

Um, so then I started thinking about that. And I really wanted to play, uh, soccer in college. So I was looking into that as well. But I ended up going to engineering route and I went to Virginia Tech for two years.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

Um, and then, uh, uh, my dad was actually doing engineering business. He, uh, he's an engineer as well. And, uh, he was doing business with a company or the university from, uh, Indiana. Um, so I got talked into, talking to the soccer coach there.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

So I could play soccer and do engineering. And so, uh, I did that for a year. Um, and then I found out, uh, that wasn't necessarily for me, um, just because, uh, the coaching and the, the people not necessarily the sport itself. So-

Dr. Miles:

So you switched, you played, you played soccer for-

642:

Uh-uh (negative).

Dr. Miles:

... Virginia Tech, then you switched-

642:

No, I didn't play soccer at Virginia Tech.

Dr. Miles:

Uh, okay.

642:

I only ended up going and playing a year at Trine, which is, uh-

Dr. Miles:

At what school?

642:

... and again, Trine University.

Dr. Miles:

Tryon?

642:

Trine, T-R-I-N-E.

Dr. Miles:

Trine University. Okay. In Indiana. So you went there-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... and you played soccer for a year-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... but you didn't like it too much.

642:

Yeah. 'Cause I, I originally went to, uh, I even had an interview with the one at Virginia Tech and stuff, but he didn't like engineers. He said that, he's like, "Uh, most of the workload is too difficult for engineers. So they end up-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

... quitting anyways," which makes sense. Um, I, I did have a tough few years there. Um, and so then, uh, but, but I still toughed it out and stuff. And then, but I ended up wanting to transfer just so I could have that fun of soccer as well and stuff. And-

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

... um, and, and then I ended, uh, meeting some friends and stuff and I didn't feel necessarily, like I, I got into other outdoor activities that I could do while I was there. Um, so I didn't feel that need for soccer, especially I wasn't getting along with the coaching [inaudible 00:03:53].

Dr. Miles:

Right, right.

642:

Um, so yeah, then I, COVID happened anyways. So, I went-

Dr. Miles:

So did you graduate from that school?

642:

... [inaudible 00:04:02]. Yeah, I ended up getting my engineering degree from there.

Dr. Miles:

From Tri- Trine.

642:

From Trine. Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. Okay.

642:

T-R-I-N-E, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

T-U-R-I-

642:

No, just T-R-I-N-E.

Dr. Miles:

T-R-I-N-E. Okay. I just never-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... heard that before. Okay.

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So you've got your engineering degree there.

642:

It's, it's a small college.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

And actually used to be called Tri-State and it's, um, family donated to it and they named it after them. So, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. So you got the engineering degree there. You didn't play soccer the last year 'cause you had some friends there.

642:

Um, correct. Well, yeah. Um, and that was like when COVID was happening and all that stuff too.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

So, uh, um, so yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Okay. So then, so that gives me a good idea of your background, your birth order, all that stuff. And then, so I'm gonna come back to so- a few other stuff-

642:

I hear you.

Dr. Miles:

... related to that, but so if you were gonna describe yourself, you know, if you were with your friend and you were describing your, you, how would you describe your personality traits?

642:

Hmm. Um, I think one of the biggest things is, uh, just hardworking. Um, I'm not, I wouldn't say I'm one of the, um, smartest or best in the group. Uh, normally I'm average. But I think, the, in the places I have succeeded, which is soccer and even making it through engineering, um, it was, uh, mainly through hard work and determination. Um, and 'cause if I think I didn't have that, um, I would've struggled a lot more. 'Cause I didn't technically fit in with either the engineers. Um, but it was something I wanted to do. So I was able to just put in a lot of effort to get it done. And it wasn't necessarily that it was like fun or anything, but-

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

... I just desired or I saw other people were having a lot of fun, especially with coding. Um, it was one of the more difficult things and some people found it a lot easier than I did. I just had to put in more time. Um-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, yeah. I can relate to that. So, so hardworking and-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... determined.

642:

And then one thing I would probably say is that, um, very agreeable. I don't, I wanna say that's a good or a bad trait. Um, but I find myself easily wanting to please people and get along with people. Um, and I've, I've recently gotten married though. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

Oh really?

642:

And I, I found that causes, uh, conflict though between, especially my immediate family and what they want and then what my wife wants. 'Cause I can't please both sides. So that's been the most stressful things lately. Um, but yeah, I, I definitely, I like to go outta my way for other people. Um, I think that I would consider that being like a good character trait. And I try, I try to be, I wanna be someone that, uh, people would look up to or really appreciate as a friend. And, uh, and so that's like what I also look for out of people. So when I see-

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

... that, so that's what I try to do.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. That's cool. I mean, yeah, that, I mean, those are good trait for sure. Um, all right. So, um, so we talked, I guess, about this prior experiences that led you, but I guess the one thing I didn't ask you is how, how, how did you decide that you wanna be a SEAL? Like how did you even know that a SEAL could be a SEAL?

642:

Um, when I was in fifth grade, uh, I read a book about them, um, I think it was like the first time I ever heard about them. Um, and then I actually met some people, well, one, one of my, my best friend's uncle was a SEAL.

Dr. Miles:

Oh, okay.

642:

And stuff like that. So I started talking to him and then, um, I knew this guy that knew some founding SEALs and had some stories and stuff. So I just like over time kept hearing stories and, um, I just felt like I could relate to a lot of it, like the hardworking and just like pushing through tough times. Like, and just some of the physical attributes I heard you needed, I just thought I really re- could relate to it. And just the, uh, whole adventure side of it. I'm a very big adventure guy. And just all of that just sounded, um, amazing to me and like something like I really could fit in and then also make a difference and stuff.

642:

And it seemed really meaningful. And at the time, like going through high school and trying to, uh, decide about like the soccer career, like I was, I was thinking, oh yeah, going to play college soccer would be cool and all, but it's not as meaningful, but I still like to be like a very active-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... person. And I've always thought this as a path that I could be very active and do something meaningful. So...

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, for sure. Very active.

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

That's for sure. So, um, so then as you were here, I guess, so first tell me what happened, like why, why are you not still in, in your class? Like, I don't know anything about you.

642:

Uh, (laughs), it's okay. Um, I, I, I still think it's kind of foggy to me as well. Um, 'cause I always told myself I'd never quit. Um, but I just had a lot of things go wrong at one time. And, um, I'm also a very big person on like how people look at me and stuff. And, um, so I, one, one big thing I had happened like I, I think it was partially because of the cold, lack of sleep and, um, and just getting hit by those ocean waves and the thing. But I, I kind of-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... got into a delirious state.

Dr. Miles:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

642:

Um, I, like, I don't know if I just had so much sand in my ear or what, but like my balance was wrong and I was getting in my head. I ended up, uh, putting on my gear in somebody else's bag 'cause I was getting rushed and somebody said, "Just throw it in this bag." Uh, they tell you not to do that. I didn't know why at the time, but, uh, people were pressuring me to get the stuff and people wanted to eat and, um, all my stuff went missing. Um, I don't know if, uh-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

... if the guy quit and all the gear went with his stuff. Um, but between that we had an inspection the next, next day and, um, I was starting to get sick too. I thought I had a fever and stuff. Um, the next day I don't think I had a fever when I went to get checked. Um, but I was getting achy and sick and I had all my stuff missing and just all this stuff went wrong at one time and uh, I just, I didn't see a way out. So...

Dr. Miles:

And where, where were you in the process?

642:

Um, I was at the end of week one.

Dr. Miles:

At the end of week one of phase one.

642:

Phase one. Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So you had made it through [inaudible 00:10:38].

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

And, and you were in the week.

642:

Yeah, it was, uh, Thursday morning.

Dr. Miles:

And had you passed all the, I don't know, whatever the obstacle course and the swimming and the running and all the other tour first-

642:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

... things that they do?

642:

... I, I passed, I passed all of them pretty well, except for, um, like even in, uh, [inaudible 00:10:56], I, I was making, um, the swim time per phase. Um, but this last swim, I didn't make it. Um, my body's starting to get really tight and everything like that too. And I don't think a lot of people made that one. Um, I don't know particularly why. Uh, but a lot of people at least had slower times on that one. I think the next sleep was easier. Um, but yeah-

Dr. Miles:

You're worn out, you know.

642:

Yeah, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

It, I think it, it was, it was, um, uh, towards the end of the week, at least. And uh, one of our, like we already did the run and the obstacle course before it, I think so.

Dr. Miles:

Right-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... right, right. So there was like Thursday night, right?

642:

Uh, it was Thursday morning, Thursday morning.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, when you were here, BUD, or, I mean, just in general, I guess, what motivates you to kind of put one foot in front of the other and kind of keep going on, especially in BUD/S when it's so painful and difficult?

642:

Um, the biggest thing, I mean, like I, I told you, like, it's always where I've seen myself. Um, so I was just trying to look towards where I would be in the future and where I could be, and I definitely got, um, like rough. Um, but then, I mean, they always talk about their, your, your why, and for me, the why was always pretty big. Um, like I had a lot of things that was pushing me to go forward and stuff.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

Um, but it, it is hard to like remember those points when you're in there, unless you're like really focused on them. But, um-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative>).

642:

... some of them was just like, I mean, a, a big piece of it was like trying to develop the person I want to be and the-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

... where I see myself and, um, it, it's just overcoming obstacles. And, um, as a kid, I, I didn't always see myself as one of the stronger kids that could stand up for what was right and stuff. And, um, so I wanted to be a more dependent and, um-

Dr. Miles:

Huh.

642:

... strong man, I guess would be, quite a bit.

Dr. Miles:

Right. Yeah. You're trying to prove that you, you could be big and tough and strong and-

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). And my, uh, brother and I, um, especially him, um, but have dealt with like, uh, bulling in the past and stuff. And I ne- I never felt like I was strong enough to stand up to them. I mean, I, I've stood up to some, got knocked down a lot. But, um, but I didn't always see my, like I always wanted to be, we, he, he has that trait too. He always wants to be bigger and better.

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

Um, so I think that was a part of it too.

Dr. Miles:

So that you wanted to be able to stand up to the people, with bullying people or whatever.

642:

Yeah. But not be, um, necessarily like an aggressive horse that like looks out and-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... like turns into like a bully yourself. But I just wanted to be able to stand up when it was wrong, you know.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. Right. For sure. What's your brother, you have a twin brother.

642:

I'm a twin. Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So is he identical twin to you?

642:

No, no. He's fraternal.

Dr. Miles:

And so doe- is he doing the of SEALs or let me know anything like that?

642:

Um, no, he, he's trying to go into, uh, like the FBI and do-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

... like a government agency or something like that.

Dr. Miles:

Oh cool.

642:

So he went and studied psychology at Montana and then, yeah, he's trying-

Dr. Miles:

Oh wow.

642:

... to find his way, and-

Dr. Miles:

Very different route than you.

642:

Yeah. Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, yeah. But still the public service thing-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... right? So that's kind of cool.

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

So now, um, would you, would you consider coming back to BUD/S?

642:

Uh, yeah. Um, so originally after, um, BUD/S happened, I was like, "Oh Lord, how can I see myself doing it?" Even going through it, I was like, "Why, why would somebody want to do this a second time?" Like I wanna-

Dr. Miles:

Why? (laughs).

642:

... make this the first time." But then, uh, obviously I didn't make it through and I didn't like how it ended. I think that's one of the biggest things is, uh, I think it was very circumstantial. And-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

... and maybe that excuse or whatever. Um, but I definitely didn't like the way it ended and, um, I would like to go again. Um, and it keeps me up at night. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

Really?

642:

Yeah. Uh, I don't, I don't sleep, I, well, I sleep thinking in BUD/S a lot, so, and I can't get it outta my head. And so I'm like, I can do-

Dr. Miles:

So if you could go back and change something, what would you change?

642:

Um, one, one thing I thought, um, going in was that, um, they would prepare you for and give you what you needed. Um, and that, like you could rely on other people, I guess, more than you could. But, and they, they say you could, and like the, the best guys make it through, I, I definitely think you can. But so many people have it on their plate, um, that I think just having a level of preparedness would've-

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

642:

... helped, um, because that would've given you more time to recover, less mistakes to make, to, uh, get punished for. Um, yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So, so, um, did you prepare, how much did you prepare, like, okay, you graduated from college, then how much time elapsed between that and then coming here and, and what did you do to prepare?

642:

Um, so I, I did a lot of training. I spent, um, I think I added a little more over a year training-

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

... for it. Um, plus having the soccer background, like I was pretty decent at running and-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

... stuff like that. Um, oh, the other thing I mentioned I would do is a lot more stretching because of the-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

... cold and stuff. I think I, I, I thought, I think it made it pretty clear too. Like I got called out for it. I reacted to the cold more than others too. Um, I shake a lot more and stuff like that. And I think it caused a lot of tightness and it slowed me down. I think in certain things, it made me have to push harder and stuff.

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

642:

So I, I think one of the big things is actually stretching, which you don't think of, 'cause you're just-

Dr. Miles:

No.

642:

... wanting to go to sleep. And they, they say sleep is better than stretching, but I think, uh, putting a little bit of time here and there to stretch would've helped.

Dr. Miles:

Yes.

642:

'Cause I didn't put any, so...

Dr. Miles:

Right. And maybe that might have helped a little bit, right?

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

Yes.

Dr. Miles:

But the cold is, it's hard to deal with that.

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

And you're a thin guy. And I mean, you know, you don't have any-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... fat on you-

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

... to keep you warm, you know. And-

642:

Yeah, that, that's one thing, uh, I did, I came in at, uh, 155 and I, I think I got up to at least 170 before we went in. So I was trying to put on a little bit of weight, um, just to have something. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

(laughs). Exactly. And now you're probably back down below 155 even.

642:

No, I'm, I'm at, uh, like 165 right now.

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

So I'm in between.

Dr. Miles:

In between, yeah.

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It just seems. Okay. So then, um, did you do anything as a practice to kind of keep, get your head in the right space, um, mental, spiritual, uh, mindfulness, whatever to try to get you through things like when you're freezing or swimming or waking up in the morning?

642:

Um, so one of the things, I mean, as I talked about before was the why, but, um, the, the biggest thing is just to tell myself to just keep going and focus on the reality of the situation.

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

Like, um, it felt like it was never gonna end when you were in there.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

Um, but just to tell yourself, just to get up and keep going, like, I mean, this, this is what I was here for. Um, so that was the biggest thing. And then, um, trying to, yeah, just make it like come down to earth, like more than it is 'cause they, they always talked about like, you're, you're not getting shot at here. I mean, this is just a training to see who, who-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... you are and stuff. Um, and like to me, I wasn't actually super concerned about it till the day everything went wrong. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

That's the way I can best put it. Like I wasn't, I, I thought I was doing pretty well. Um, I was making good times before and everything before. Um, I thought I was a, uh, one of the top ones in the class. Um, and yeah, so...

Dr. Miles:

But then you put your stuff in a wrong bag. So then what was the ramifications for you? Like why did that matter? I mean, I guess I don't understand how the process-

642:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

... works. So couldn't you just get new gear or what, I mean what, no, it's not like that.

642:

So, so, um, one, one big thing they, they talk about all the time and so, so I'm still not clear like what the ramifications would've been if I were to keep going.

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

Um, but, uh, so when we got there that night we had to clean up, it's always, um, team's gear, uh, teammates, and then yourself that you look after. Um, so once I got done putting everything else up and all that, um, and helping put away gear, then you have to go and you take out your own gear and clean your gear. And we had to lay it out all on the table and, um, and then they, the next day they were gonna come in and inspect it and all our gear and I had none of my gear. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

So, uh, I couldn't clean anything. And so, um, and some of that gear is like a wet suit and um-

Dr. Miles:

Oh.

642:

... and tan and stuff like that. So also the next day, I think, uh, like if we had any water gear, water training, stuff like that, like I wouldn't have any of my gear. So I don't know what they would've done if they would've sent me to it. I've never heard of it before of a person losing their gear, at least not everything. So I think if it was like one or two things, like there's definitely people that, um-

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

642:

... quit that you could have got your gear from, but uh, to take everything I, I just didn't even know to do. 'Cause they like-

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

... maybe return everybody else's gear too at the end. So that's clear also.

Dr. Miles:

And it's not like you can go to the instructor and say, "Mr. Instructor, I'm not sure what to do. I lost my gear," right?

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

And they would, that probably wouldn't go over well.

642:

No, I didn't think so either. (laughs).

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

So-

Dr. Miles:

I don't know, but my guess is that wouldn't have been well with you.

642:

I couldn't, yeah, I, I couldn't bring myself to even talk to him about it. So I, 'cause I know you get punished for not having your gear like cleaned-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

perfectly. Like, I mean, that's understandable, but I don't know what the repercussions would've been for not having any, anything-

Dr. Miles:

Not having the gear-

642:

... so...

Dr. Miles:

... at all. (laughs).

642:

I just know it would've made me bad, like look bad. And, uh, I don't know if the instructors would single me out or what would happen, so...

Dr. Miles:

Right, right.

642:

But yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So you took care of that problem.

642:

Definitely lost the respect for that for sure.

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Right, right. So do you think that this whole experience, um, being at BUD/S has changed you at all?

642:

Um, I would like to say so. Um, but I'm still trying to figure myself out right now, um, that drive to, uh, to, to push forward, especially like I'm going to, uh, air rescue now.

Dr. Miles:

Oh, okay.

642:

It just, it feels different.

Dr. Miles:

Huh.

642:

Trying to find my reason and what I'm fighting for. 'Cause I mean, I've been dreaming of being a SEAL since I was a little kid and then-

Dr. Miles:

Right.

642:

... always pushed me. Um, so I'm still trying to figure out where I am, who I am, what's my, why I, uh, what's driving me now. So...

Dr. Miles:

Do you think you'll try to come back?

642:

I do. Um, it, it is a, like my wife's kind of against it and I know it's, uh, it's kind of something we gotta decide on together. Um, but-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... personally I want to come back. Um, like I said, I don't like the way I went out. So...

Dr. Miles:

Is she here?

642:

Uh, no. She's in Indiana.

Dr. Miles:

In Indiana. Okay.

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

I, yeah, I, I would think that, that this would be a hard career. You know what I mean? Like I, I personally think I would love it like for-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... for me.

642:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

But, but I suspect that if my spouse was doing it, you know what I mean?

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

It could be, I could see-

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

... what talking about.

642:

So it, it's definitely a lot harder, like, 'cause I'll be busy and doing all this stuff.

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

Um, but she wants to start a family and stuff. So it'd be a lot harder on her and having kids and stuff like that. And then I'd miss their, like growing up. And that's, uh, one thing that I didn't hear as much about until I got here was, uh, how much like you're not home even when you're home type of thing. Um, so-

Dr. Miles:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

642:

... I mean it's still something I really want to do. So-

Dr. Miles:

Right, right.

642:

... and I think it's worth it. But yeah, you're sacrificing a lot for that. And that means your spouse too, so...

Dr. Miles:

Uh-huh (affirmative). Right.

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

It's both of you.

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

Correct.

Dr. Miles:

So then at the end of the day, when, when you're sitting here answering these questions and you're talking to me, is there anything that like we should ask you that I'm not asking you that might provide some insight into all of this, that would be helpful for us to know?

642:

Um, I wish I had a clear answer to that, but-

Dr. Miles:

(laughs).

642:

... like I said, I'm still trying to figure out myself as of-

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

... right now.

Dr. Miles:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

642:

Um-

Dr. Miles:

You pretty seem like a pretty thoughtful guy, you know, I mean, you know, that you think about things, so...

642:

Yeah. Well, I've def- I have definitely thought about this a lot. I mean-

Dr. Miles:

Hmm.

642:

... it's, it's constantly in my head. Um, but-

Dr. Miles:

Well, let me ask you this, did you come in as an officer or did you come in as enlisted?

642:

Um, so I, I came in as an enlisted, um, for actually the reason, uh, there's two reasons. Um, from what I understand, it's a lot harder to even get in.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah.

642:

And, and even let alone get a second try if you're an officer. Um, and I understand that there's a, obviously a high failure rate. Um, and the other reason is 'cause like I said, I'm a very active person. I like to be active in doing things. Um, and I heard basically you get a year out in the field and then as an officer and then you basically get behind a desk or somewhere. Um, and I'd, I'd rather have as much time in the field. And then if I want to, um, apply for the, uh, officer candidate school or whatever-

Dr. Miles:

Right, right.

642:

... OCS or whatever that's-

Dr. Miles:

Okay.

642:

... afterwards. So yeah. So I came in enlisted and so enlisted.

Dr. Miles:

Came in enlisted. Yeah.

642:

Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. Okay.

642:

Yeah. That's a good question though. YeaH.

Dr. Miles:

Yeah. I mean, doesn't matter. I, I don't care about, I'm just, you know, curious. It's interesting to me, how many people have college degrees-

642:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Miles:

... who then enlist. I mean like I think every person I've interviewed, maybe they don't have a degree, but they, they've at least been to college. Like, um, but, but many of them have the degree actually.

642:

Yeah. Yeah.

Dr. Miles:

So, I mean, I think that's all good. Okay. So I'm gonna stop this.

642:

Yeah.

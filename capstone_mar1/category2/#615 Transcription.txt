615: Medical.

CDR Ledford: Medical roll, okay. Medical roll. What was it? Was it uh ...

615: Uh, I had SIPE, and I also had uh, a stress fracture in my right shin.

CDR Ledford: Ooh. What about this, this go with 351?

615: Um, I didn't have any real medical problems.

CDR Ledford: [inaudible 00:02:00], okay.

615: Just kinda was cold. (laughs)

CDR Ledford: Okay. So that was, that was 351, so that was probably what, like 10 weeks ago?

615: Yeah, somethin' like that.

CDR Ledford: Yeah, 10 weeks ago. Okay. Got it. So, can you describe a little bit about you childhood? Like uh, did you guys move around a lot, parents together, siblings, sports?

615: Um, uh, my, both my parents are together. I've got two older brothers, one's 25 and one's 22. Um, I played soccer the majority of my life, and then in high school I picked up rugby in uh, sophomore year. Never moved around, really. Just stayed in the, pretty much grew up in the same house.

CDR Ledford: Good. And two older brothers, you said?

615: Yeah. 25 and 22.

CDR Ledford: ... 22, okay. How would you describe your personality, uh, with traits? If you had to describe three different traits, how would you describe your personality?

615: Mindful ... Honest ... Passive sometimes.

CDR Ledford: What did you do uh, for the last five years prior to training?

615: Uh, I was in high school and um, so pretty much ...

CDR Ledford: So weh, high school, straight to bootcamp?

615: Yeah, high school, straight to boot camp.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Yeah. In your previous, you know, prior to BUD/S, um, is there any ... Did you have any prior experiences that'd be kind of life-changing? Like felt like really molded you, or changed the direction of your life, or shaped you in some way? Any experiences that kinda stuck out?

615: Um, I think my, my brother that's 22, he had a, kind of a troubling, I'd say kinda quarter-life crises or somethin' like that.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: In, in high school he was kinda a troubled kid where he would um, he got involved with trouble with the law and stuff like that, and I just kinda didn't wanna fall under that kinda category, and try to steer far away from that.

CDR Ledford: And so, is this your 22-year-old brother-

615: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: ... or 25?

615: 22.

CDR Ledford: So this is the one who's closer to you, to, in age?

615: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: It was my freshman year, and he was a senior.

CDR Ledford: Okay.

615: So I kinda knew a little more-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: ... once I got to high school about kinda what he was doing, and then ...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: ... just didn't wanna fall that way. There was kind of a reputation around him.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: And when I got to high school, it started coming-

CDR Ledford: You could see it?

615: Yeah, I could see it 'cause ... "Oh, you're his younger brother, blah blah blah."

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: So a lot of teachers would mention that, too, and I'd just try to ...

CDR Ledford: Interesting.

615: Yeah, so I'd try to steer away from acting that way, and be my own person.

CDR Ledford: Describe your background that led you to join the Navy.

615: Um, I always wanted to be in the military in general, ever since I was in like, elementary school I would say. I, I went to the recruit one time when I was real young, I think like third grade. And I went over to the, the Navy side and they showed me that, and I was pretty interested. Even like, I think I have a picture from third grade where my grandpa got me a Navy SEAL hat and I was wearing it. So I was pretty interested for a long time in the, the SEAL program, so ...

CDR Ledford: Uh, what motivates you on a daily basis?

615: Um, do right by my family, I'd say.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Can you uh, describe your experience at BUD/S?

615: Um, definitely more of a challenge than I anticipated it to be, and um ... Even for the little time I was in it, I think I had learned a lot about myself, what I'm capable of.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Anything about like, interaction with students, or instructors? Or did you see a difference between 347 and 351?

615: Um, I don't think there was a real difference. Um, definitely like, I'd say being around older guys ... I'm, I'm pretty, I'm considered pretty young for a class, I think. The average cla, um, age from the classes I was in was like 24 to 26, and I'm 20 years old. So I guess being able to interact with older, older men, I just kinda learned a little more, I guess life experience without experiencing it, I guess.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Is there a time that you had a uh, you had to make a difficult decision?

615: Um ...

CDR Ledford: During BUD/S? And what went through you mind when you were making that decision?

615: Definitely quitting was a big decision. Um, I didn't really think too hard on it, um ...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: I don't remember uh, thinking, er, like thinking over the weekend-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: ... or anything that I was going to do, uh, but in the moment I was, I was on the fence about it and I just did it. And then definitely regretted it for a while, but ...

CDR Ledford: So was that uh, it was something that ... Like, what part were you, where were you doing when you ...

615: We were doing uh, swimmer, ss, uh, surf rescue.

CDR Ledford: Uh-huh (affirmative).

615: And we were just in and out of the water, and then I think we were in the, we had like a surf immersion that morning, and I swam. So my, I was kinda feelin' like my lungs were getting SIPE again.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: And then I was thinking ahead to like, I knew we had the night evolution that night with the uh, night surf passage. And I was just thinkin' that I wasn't gonna be able to like, keep up with, with my guys under a boat because I just couldn't run.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: I mean, we were doin' like, burn sprints and stuff just for um, the evolution we were in. And I was huffin' and puffin' and I was just like, I don't really wanna ... Don't really wanna either be forced out by the guys I'm around, or ...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: ... or um, make them suffer any m, more than they have to, especially when it could be easier.

CDR Ledford: Is there anything that you would have done differently?

615: Um, I think between um, 347 and 351 when I was healing up from my stress fracture, I wish I would've uh, maybe been a little more disciplined in training my, on my own accord.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). How much time was there between?

615: Ah, let's see, four classes, so ... I think 347 was March, February and March.

CDR Ledford: Yeah, so maybe eight months?

615: Yeah, somethin' like that.

CDR Ledford: Yeah, about eight months.

615: Six, six to eight I think.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Six to eight months. And were you just here, you were, where were you at?

615: Uh, yeah. I was in 505.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: And I was LOD for, I'd say over half of that time, just letting my leg get better. And then I went into PTRR, and um, we were doing the evolutions there. But I mean, we only did like the big th, big three or four, where you're ... You do like a calisthenic workout-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: ... a swim, run, O-course. And I'm, wish I would of did a little more training in my own time.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Good. Uh, would you consider coming back?

615: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: So, that's what you wanna do.

615: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

CDR Ledford: What practices, like physical, mental, or spiritual do you use to push through any challenges?

615: Um, I had a mentor that introduced me to like, Stoic philosophy.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: So I kinda picked up a few things there, um ...

CDR Ledford: Like what?

615: A big phrase that kinda stuck with me, stuck out to me was uh, Memento Mori.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: Just remember one day, uh, remember your death is coming one day, pretty much.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

615: So, kinda take it with a grain of salt that ... Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Anything else? Mm?

615: Um ...

CDR Ledford: As far as a daily practice, or ritual or anything?

615: Um, no real daily practice, I'd say.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay. And how do you, how would you say this has changed you as a person, this experience?

615: Um ... Definitely that I can take a f, take failure well, I'd say. 'Cause um, I mean, like I said earlier, this is kinda the, what I wanted to do for a long time. And then suddenly I'm not doing it, so ...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

615: I was, I think I was able to get over that failure pretty quickly, and readjust and ... Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Got it. Uh, is there anything else you feel like, in regards to these things that we should ask you guys?

615: Mm ...

CDR Ledford: Is there any other question that you think would be a good question that we should ask?

615: Mm, [crosstalk 00:15:25] nothing really comes to mind.

CDR Ledford: M'kay. Awesome. All right. Christian, right?

615: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Christian. I really appreciate you stickin' around and doin' this.

615: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Especially when all the other guys opted out-

615: (laughs) Yeah.

CDR Ledford: ... and buggered out on us like that. But um, it's been really helpful.

615: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

CDR Ledford: Let me uh, stop the re-

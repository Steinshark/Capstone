Dr. Luning: I've got a back up here on my phone just in case. So, um, easy questions first, uh, what phase did you leave BUD/S?

603: Um, it was right before Hell Week.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: I was a performance drop for uh, drown proofing.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Okay. Um, and, uh, how many weeks ago was that?

603: Uh, the end of October, so eight-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: Eight or nine.

Dr. Luning: So tell me a little bit about your childhood, I know that's a round question, but-

603: Uh, yeah. (laughter) Grew up in Miami with a good family, two brothers, and mom and dad.

Dr. Luning: Mm-hmm (affirmative)

603: Uh, played soccer my whole life.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: Um, went to school, and, uh, then I played soccer for Ohio State.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Did you do four years at Ohio State?

603: Yes.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: A civil engineering degree.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Um, I'll come back to that. Uh, anything else, did you move around at all in your childhood, or always in Miami?

603: Uh, no. It was always in Miami.

Dr. Luning: And you-

603: Same house that... Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: I visited recently, so...

Dr. Luning: Did you have a good break-[crosstalk 00:01:22]

603: Yeah. It was nice to be-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Normal for a little bit.

Dr. Luning: Yeah. (laughter) Escape.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Escape one sunny area to another sunny area.

603: Yeah. (laughter)

Dr. Luning: Um, I, I lived in San Diego for 11 years so I, I miss it quite a bit-

603: Oh, really?

Dr. Luning: Actually. The sun and, and everything. Um, you said you played soccer. Anything else kind of in your childhood that stood out? Sports, any other sports, or-

603: Uh-

Dr. Luning: Hobbies-

603: Hobbies. Soccer, mountain biking, uh, snowboarding, skating.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: Just kind of in that-

Dr. Luning: Okay. What about if you were to describe your personality, like three traits of your personality. How would you describe it?

603: Uh, hard working, honest, and probably outgoing.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Um, so you talked a little bit about Ohio State, so when Ohio State... Did you play soccer at Ohio State?

603: Yes.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Four years there, civil engineering degree. Any... Did you go from... What happened after Ohio State?

603: I worked in Columbus-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: For a construction firm. I was just a project manager for, like, two and a half years.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: And then when I decided to do this, I moved back home to train-

Dr. Luning: Got it.

603: And then I worked with my dad, so-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: That's it.

Dr. Luning: Um, so last, if you, um, walk me back five years prior to coming to BUD/S, what did that five years look like? And it would probably encompass what you just explained, but-

603: Five years I was probably... I was about to graduate.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: Or, I was getting ready to graduate from OSU. So, I had just finished soccer, 'cause soccer's a fall sport. And, uh, just going through an easy semester, and kind of just enjoying myself finally in college, so that was it.

Dr. Luning: So, when you were in college, you think you were gonna join the Navy, or was that after?

603: Yes. I was close to joining the ROTC-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: In college, but then I... There's no way you can play a sport and have that-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: 'Cause, well, if you were in the Naval Academy, yeah, but- (laughter)

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Not if, if you're just in the regular school, like doing both of them is kind of hard to do. Um, but yeah, I've always wanted to join. My dad was a big factor. He never went to college, but he did go to the Air Force-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: And that made him successful, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I always thought that was my inspiration-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: To join, at least.

Dr. Luning: So did he retire from the Air Force, or-

603: No. He just did, I think, two contracts, so maybe eight to ten years-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: And then he got out, worked for Caterpillar, and then started his own business. And now-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Yup.

Dr. Luning: Um, and so, why Navy and not Air Force?

603: Um, because the SEALS.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: I wanted to do something a little bit more challenging than the Air Force.

Dr. Luning: Okay. So with, uh, SEALS, was that something, like, you were thinking about before... Like, how long were you thinking about trying to become a SEAL?

603: Probably since high school.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: I would say it didn't start before high school, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: High school.

Dr. Luning: Anything that was, like, the tipping point for that?

603: Uh, to join?

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Or, like, that was... That was, like, why you wanted to be SEALS, or interested in SEALS.

603: Um, just reflection.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: That's kind of what I used to decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, it just... Am I happy with where I am now? Just being honest with myself, and then that's what made me go to the recruiting office, and then-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: That's why I'm here. (laughs)

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: What about if you think about kind of your life experiences prior to coming to BUD/S, do you think if there any is, like, life shaping experiences?

603: Um, as in, like-

Dr. Luning: Throughout your whole life.

603: Yeah. Um, not really. I think I had really good life.

Dr. Luning: Oh.

603: Anything, any hardships I had were just, like, on myself. Like, I brought it on... Upon myself, not any-... No one else.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Like I said, I was lucky to have a good family. And then, I was pretty smart, so I did do some good things, and then I also did some bad things, so (laughs) there's nothing... There's nothing... I've always just been a hard worker, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative)

603: I thought this was the right thing, and then, unfortunately, I just didn't make it through-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: One test, so...

Dr. Luning: Um, uh, this is a later question, but I'll ask now. Have you given though to trying to come back and do this thing again?

603: Yes.

Dr. Luning: Okay. Good.

603: It's not as easy, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I would like to come back, and I'm 27 now.

Dr. Luning: Okay.

603: So I'm a little older, so I would want to come back at least within three years.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So I would love to come back, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: It's really hard.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: It doesn't... My best... Some of my best friends that I made, they're right now in second phase-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So that, like... I would like to be with them, and stuff like that, but I would definitely want to come back.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Well, we've seen that, um, in... Over and over in this... In this... I mean, I'm sure you've heard stories, and, and it's harder, like you said, but-

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Um, we've honestly seen it quite a bit. Um, more than we anticipated, and more than I think people are aware. (laughs)

603: Yeah. Exactly.

Dr. Luning: Um, and that's part of why we want to kind of talk to you, and understand, like, there's, there's definitely that chance and potential.

603: Mm-hmm (affirmative)

Dr. Luning: Harder path, but-

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: It's, it's a path.

603: Not the path you want, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah. But-

603: Everything happens for a reason, so-

Dr. Luning: Exactly, and it's a path, and we have met lots of... Lots of guys that have gone through that way.

603: Okay.

Dr. Luning: And, um, and done really well.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Um, what about, uh... I asked you about your background, joined the Navy. Any, any family members that were Navy, anything else that-

603: No.

Dr. Luning: Kind of led to Navy? Okay.

603: No one.

Dr. Luning: Um, what motivates you on a daily basis?

603: Uh, when I was in BUD/S, now this is a little different, but I would just think of my reason why I was here, and I'd get up out of bed, and it's an honor just to be here and be training here, so I wouldn't want to, like, disappoint anyone.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And I would... I know that I have it in me to do this job, but... So I'd just wake up with a smile on my face, and no matter what was happening during the day, I would always try to make a joke or smile, and just that was it. I knew I could do it, so I just had to push myself through it.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Yup.

Dr. Luning: What about before BUD/S? Anything different that motivated you?

603: For BUD/S?

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Um, soccer, and then, like, for that one point in my life it was just kind of just making money, and trying to get higher up in whatever comp-... Or, in the two companies I was in. Other than that, that was it, just, just it, it wasn't hard to get out of bed. Just-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Just a boring hard worker, I guess.

Dr. Luning: Um, can you... If you don't mind-

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Um, describing your experience here at BUD/S.

603: Um, don't believe any of the podcasts or books, 'cause it's a lot harder than that nowadays.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: (laughs) Um, it was cold. Uh, they kind of just... The best advice I ever got, or the best real word I got at BUD/S is, like, they break you, they throw you in the ocean, and then they see what comes out.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: If nothing comes out, nothing comes out, but yeah, it's a... You push your body to the limit. I've never... I played soccer in college. We got some tough, like, days, like in off season when we would train, but nothing compares to how you feel, like, after the first week here.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So, it's, uh... It's really tough.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: But-

Dr. Luning: Um, but what do you think makes it so tough, like physically, mentally, both?

603: Uh, so they say that (laughs)... So they say that it's all mental-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Like, military training is all mental, but here it's not. It's, uh... I mean, when you get to BUD/S, like the first... One of the meetings you're fir-... The first meeting you have with an instructor is them telling you that it's mostly physical.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And it's, like, 10% mental, I think is what he said. Um, it's all physical, 'cause... A good part of it is mental, but if you can get through two days and feel fine on the third day, then you've won half the battle.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Because the third day is you're just cold all day, so... Um, but I wouldn't say... There's a point where you get [inaudible] mentality, and that's probably Hell Week, but I wasn't there.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Um, but it's all physical for the first three weeks.

Dr. Luning: Oh. What about, um... Tell me a time where you had to make a difficult decision during training here at BUD/S, if there were any, and what made you... Went through your mind when you had to make those decisions.

603: Uh, there's a Master Chief here that teaches a couple tricks that, like, maintain your cool.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And for me, I did a lot of self talk.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So I would... There was... There was times when you're just sitting in the water and, um, you want to get up and go get warm, but you've just got to wait a little bit more, so you talk to yourself, and that's what helps. It really does. Um, other than that, I don't think we really had a... There's another thing, I don't know if you know running boat, like-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: You run with a boat on your head.

Dr. Luning: Yep.

603: There's some times you have to make a difficult decision if you, like, know someone, but they can't keep up. And then, the instructors also, like, help you make that decision-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So, sometimes you've got to... They call it run it out, run your... Run the guy out of your boat crew.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So that's a pretty tough decision, 'cause you never want to be the guy. You don't want to be someone's enemy in BUD/S, like you don't want to be an extra instructor.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: But sometimes you have to do that-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Because if not, then you're going to get in trouble for not doing it. It's all a-

Dr. Luning: Was there-

603: It's all a game, so-

Dr. Luning: Actually, two questions for that. For the first one is, was there a time in, in your boat crew where you had to do that, run somebody out?

603: Yes.

Dr. Luning: And, and went through your mind when you were trying to cut-[crosstalk 00:12:12]

603: I, I didn't want... None of us wanted to... We all knew the kid, none of us wanted to do it, but if we didn't do it, then we were gonna get beat for a little longer than we were... Than anyone would want to.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And then, so we had to.

Dr. Luning: So, other question relative to the comment you made about it's all a game. Could you expand on that [inaudible]... That... Like, what do you mean by that, when you say that?

603: I think the people that have the most success here at BUD/S are mature.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: If they realize that the people are just screaming at them, and it's like, they'll turn away and they'll never remember your name.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: If you realize stuff like that, and you can just... Kind of just take it on the chin, that's what, uh... That's all it is. And like, I've... There's so many times where your room can be completely squared away and they'll just fail you for something dumb.

Dr. Luning: Um-

603: They just want to see what you're gonna do, and that's kind of it-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: It's just... It's all a game. (laughs) In the beginning, it's all... It, it's all physical, like I said, and then it's just... It's, uh, how do you call it? It's this fake chaos-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: That they'll just see how people react, and then there's also... There's always people that you think are gonna make it, but then once you introduce chaos they don't know what to do.

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Why do you think they don't know what to do?

603: I think there's a lot of people that come here that are studs-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And they probably have never been, like, a failure, or like, been told that they suck-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Or stuff like, like, never been stressed out, and tired, and all these different, like, negative emotions at the same time, so they just... They know the easy path is just to ring the bell, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: That's what they do.

Dr. Luning: So what do you think it is that, that makes, like, you c-... And this is why I'm like, 'cause you said that word, and, and it's something when you watch, um, kind of various evolutions that you all, all go through at BUD/S, like that's always my thought. "This is a game." But I'm removed from it, number one. (laughs)

603: Yeah, exactly.

Dr. Luning: And number two, I'm a lot older, and so I can... I can catch that, but what do you think it is, like, what... That had you realize that versus somebody else, maybe, that's in it and not realizing that?

603: Um, I think the... One of the biggest things about being a SEAL is being... Like, the ability to stay calm-[crosstalk 00:14:40]

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Chaotic situations. So if you're just... If you're calm, if you're naturally a calm person, I think you'll have a better shot here. And then, also, if you know how to control your emotions, like, something like self talk helps.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And like, you'll be able to realize that, like, um... Like, let's say this guy just screamed at the kid right next to me, and maybe he, like, put hands on him, but he didn't hurt him. All he did was trying to scare him, rile him up a little bit, and then the next thing you know, that kid's in the truck. So, like, it's... I don't know-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: It's just... Like you said, you can... If you're mature, and you see what's going on, it's all a game, but until you're in that environment and your heart is beating... Like, you can hear your heartbeat in your head-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Your legs aren't moving, like, (laughs) as fast as you want them to do, and then you're just so sore that-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: You can't even do 20 push ups anymore. Until you're in that environment, you can't really... You don't know how you're gonna react, but if you have a level head, and you're expecting to feel that bad... Like, I was expecting to be, like, uncomfortable the whole time, and-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I was. So if you're honest with yourself, I think you have a better shot.

Dr. Luning: Yeah, absolutely.

603: But... And if you're okay with getting beat even though, like, you won. If you're okay with failure, you'll also be fine here as well.

Dr. Luning: So, how about you? Have you... Did you fail a lot in, uh... Prior to BUD/S, like, that, that kind of built up some ability to fail?

603: Yeah. There's, there was one time in college, I think this was what kind of made me a little mentally tougher, I guess you can say-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Is that I almost got kicked off the soccer team-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: 'Cause I was, like... I got hurt one semester, so I couldn't play, so I was just going out and I was paying attention to school. So that, that, like, that was a wake up call to me to, like, stop being dumb and do what you're supposed to do-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Like, you're going to college for free, don't mess that up.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And, uh, just being able to be, I think, real with yourself, and have reflections, and moments of reflection, I think that's important. As corny as that sounds, but it works for... It worked for me. I think it works for a lot of people that come through, too.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So-

Dr. Luning: No, I mean, you're saying all this stuff that, that makes sense, and what kind of we know from research about kind of persistence, and it's, uh, somewhat having this maturity and experiences, and-

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Failures that-[crosstalk 00:17:29]

603: I think that's the, the best candidates come through here, most of the ones that have had college-

Dr. Luning: Yeah, absolutely.

603: The average age in my class was 23.

Dr. Luning: Yeah. So-

603: Mostly guys that made it were, uh, I think at least 21, so-

Dr. Luning: And, and they... That, that echoes what we've seen, too, over and over is the maturity definitely wins out.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Definitely. Um, is there anything that you would have done differently at BUD/S?

603: Honestly?

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: (laughs) I would have probably taken something for my lungs, 'cause I couldn't hold my breath for long.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Which... 'Cause I knew I... Like, if you took me out to do that test today, I could pass it, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: In BUD/S you're so broken down, that, uh, everything... Like, a simple task can become hard-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: But I could have... I could have practiced it more, I guess, but, um, I guess I just could have... I could have worked harder to make sure that I didn't fail those evolutions, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I never thought I would, 'cause I passed... I could do them on a regular day, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: You just never know, really.

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Well, I think you hit on a key is your body is pretty broken down. (laughs)

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: And, and that's, that's a piece of it.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Um, how... When... With, with those evolutions that, that you failed, and, and what... How tired were you, do you remember? I mean, do you remember-[crosstalk 00:19:05]

603: I was actually talking about it, uh, maybe like, last week. You do a practice-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And I did the practice fine. Like, I thought it was... I thought it was, like, so relaxing 'cause we didn't do... You're not harassed or anything, and-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I was like, "Okay, I'm good." And then when I went to do the actual test, the first time I passed out, so I was just... I was going until I failed.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And then the second time, um, I just... I couldn't even stay close to the top of the water.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I don't know what was wrong, but the... When we did the practices in the beginning of the first week, then we did the actual test, it was like, in the middle of the second week, and start of the third week, so... I guess I could have been better in the water, or could have had some fat on me, but I, (laughs) I was losing some weight, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Makes sense.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: So we talked about this, but, um, so definitely a goal to try to get back here is kind of-

603: Yes.

Dr. Luning: Um, any practices, physical, mental, spiritual that you do to push through challenges, whether it was at BUD/S, or before, or after?

603: No.

Dr. Luning: Mm-hmm (affirmative) You-

603: Be... Try to be funny in the... (laughs) Um, enduring the hard times, and-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Just take everything on the chin, 'cause if you come here thinking you're not gonna fail, then you're not being honest with yourself. I knew I was gonna fail at something, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah. Um, how has this experience changed you as a person, if at all?

603: Uh, I don't think... Unless I come back here, I don't think I'll ever do something as hard as this was.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: So it's made me a tougher person, and I know, like, that I can do the hardest thing in the world, so if I do come back here, I'll just have to... I guess just think that I have done it before, but I'm definitely a tougher person, probably more hard working. But right now, I just, like, 'cause you're in this, like, limbo-

Dr. Luning: Yep.

603: You don't know what's gonna happen next. I'm just... That's it.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Yeah. Kind of unmotivated right now, but-

Dr. Luning: Yeah, that's... Well, understandable.

603: Yeah, exactly.

Dr. Luning: When the... Do you know when you find out what the next steps are for you?

603: Uh, no. It's kind of... They call you in for a job sheet, though-[crosstalk 00:21:36]

Dr. Luning: Got it.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Got it. Um, any, anything I should have asked that I didn't ask, or you think would be worthy... Worth sharing?

603: I don't know. I don't... Like I said, like, this, this place is hard for the average person to understand-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: But like you, if you've seen it before, I think then you can write about it, but other than that, this place has gotten significantly harder than it ever was.

Dr. Luning: Oh.

603: And, I don't know. (laughs)

Dr. Luning: Let me ask you, so it's the second time you've said it, and we've seen it... I mean, 'cause we'll get the numbers, and hear that, like, so many people have dropped after Hell Week, or first fit-... Like, early-

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: In first phase, more than were back in... When we started this study in 2018.

603: Yeah, my class, they, like... I guess the... After the first week, they had the most drops in, like, 20 something years.

Dr. Luning: So why do you think that is? Like, what i-... What's happening that's different?

603: Um, I think a lot of people that come here are also the people that just listen to podcasts and maybe not do so much-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: Research. So that could be a factor, but there's a lot of people that aren't as prepared.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I don't know if it's 'cause they're listening to that, but I, I mean, Master Chief, uh, Hanson, the guy that's in charge of BUD/S, he nor-... He always says that, like, the greatest equalizer's the Pacific Ocean-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And I think it is.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: 'Cause... I mean, my whole class, by the end of the second week when they'll tell us to go hit the surf, they're the worst surf hits in the world. Like, they were half surf hits-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And like, even I and everyone, you just... You don't feel it at first, but the water just breaks you down.

Dr. Luning: Yup.

603: 'Cause, like, being cold all the time is not fun.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: And shivering all the time is not fun, and getting wet is not that fun after, you know, like, 200 times getting wet, so-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: I think it's mostly the ocean, and then it is a lot more hectic.

Dr. Luning: Hey. We're wrapping up. [inaudible] And you need form consents, too.

Speaker 3: Uh, I've got plenty of form consents, but-

Dr. Luning: Okay.

Speaker 3: Just the file cards.

Dr. Luning: Here you go.

Speaker 3: Great, thank you.

Dr. Luning: Yup. Yeah. So, just the Pacific Ocean, equalizer.

603: Pacific Ocean, equalizer, and then, um, I think the more... The logs and the boats-

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: That gets most of the people. And a lot of people say it's the grind, which-

Dr. Luning: Just the daily, like-

603: Yeah, but I don't think... If you actually... Like, I actually, I want to be here. I still want to be here.

Dr. Luning: Yeah.

603: You, you enjoy it. Like, you don't really care that you have no sleep, you just... You just enjoy it, like I, I loved being here, so I think... They always say your reason why is super important, too, so I think just nowadays, with our generation, I don't think they really think about it as hard as they should.

Dr. Luning: Makes sense.

603: Yeah.

Dr. Luning: Well, thank you. I'm gonna turn these off.

603: Yeah, no problem.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay, can I get your number please?

641:

641.

Dr. Dixon:

And is it okay if I record this?

641:

Yes.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay, great. Um, I'm just gonna start off with what phase did you leave from BUD/S?

641:

Uh, phase one.

Dr. Dixon:

And how many weeks ago was that?

641:

Um, five.

Dr. Dixon:

Five weeks ago? And so what class were you in?

641:

351.

Dr. Dixon:

351. Okay, great. So, um, as Commander [Ledford 00:00:27] said, we would need to know a little bit about you. So, I'm gonna ask, you know, tell me a little bit about your childhood, like, are you from a big family, did you move a lot, are your parents still together, are you the first, oldest, youngest, that, kind of, stuff. So, if you could give me a few minutes of that.

641:

Um, second-

Dr. Dixon:

... [inaudible 00:00:44] traits, what would you say?

641:

Um, diligent, hard working, um, I'm hopefully kind.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

Try to be kind, [crosstalk 00:00:57].

Dr. Dixon:

That's good, yeah. I- I would hope my kids would say that.

641:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And then what did you do in the last five years prior to training?

641:

Uh, college, I did a mission trip.

Dr. Dixon:

So, college. Did you f- finish college? Wh- where'd you go to college?

641:

At, uh, Brigham Young University.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

[inaudible 00:01:19] so far.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. And then did you a mission trip where?

641:

Uh, Truk in Micronesia.

Dr. Dixon:

I don't even know where that is. Wow-

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

... wh- what's it near?

641:

Uh, Guam.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay-

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

... okay. So you speak Spanish or [crosstalk 00:01:32]-

641:

I speak Trukese.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay-

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

... that's interesting.

641:

Yeah, it's a, it's an isolated area, so it doesn't ... Really useful language but-

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

... at least I know it.

Dr. Dixon:

Well, yeah-

641:

(laughs)

Dr. Dixon:

... yeah, heck yeah. Okay, so if you think of any prior experiences that you've had prior to BUD/S, what were really life changing or life shaping for you?

641:

Um, the mission trip for sure and, uh, getting, wanted to go to college in high school, and then, uh, the mission trip helped that. And then-

Dr. Dixon:

So did you go to the mission trip before college?

641:

Uh, I did a little bit of college before. It's ... I did a little bit of college in high school and knew I didn't really want to do it. And then I said I'll take a break and go on a mission trip. Went and did that and then that was two years, came home, and then I decided that, you know, I needed to ... It just helped me grow up a little bit-

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

... and I wanted to go to college. Ultimately helped pushed me towards this path and-

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

... now I'm [crosstalk 00:02:27].

Dr. Dixon:

I'm gonna ask you about that too.

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

Um, so, what- what led you to join the Navy? What ... So you did the mission trip, then you were in college.

641:

Always have wanted to join the Navy. Um, but I think, um, kind of, more of, like I didn't, I didn't have the balls to do it. Sorry that's probably not-

Dr. Dixon:

No-

641:

... the right thing to-

Dr. Dixon:

... I was in the Army-

641:

... say. (laughs)

Dr. Dixon:

... 22 years, so you cannot-

641:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

Dr. Dixon:

... say anything that would, (laughs) uh, that's gonna bother me, believe me. Okay.

641:

I just had other jobs and, like, they were good jobs and I, like, really enjoyed them, and they were, they were good for my progression in life, but I got bored of them.

Dr. Dixon:

Like what jobs?

641:

Uh, like, as a data analyst and stuff. And then, also-

Dr. Dixon:

Was this-

641:

... um-

Dr. Dixon:

... during college or after college?

641:

Uh, so it was during college. This was, like, part of my college, doin' that.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

And I liked it a lot, but I always got bored of it. And so far I'm not bored of this job, so I've been, knowing this is, kind of, the right path.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay- okay, great. But always Navy, not Army or Air Force-

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

... or-

641:

Well I swam. I always knew I wanted to swim.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

You know, I hate the water after this. (laughs)

Dr. Dixon:

Oh, okay- okay. And what do you think motivates you on a daily basis?

641:

Um, pride.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

Pride I could do somethin' good.

Dr. Dixon:

Excellent. Okay, can, if you don't mind, could you tell me the experience at BUD/S, what- what, um, what happened, what- what was your experience?

641:

It was the hardest thing I've ever, I've ever done. Uh, it was just mentally challenging, that's for sure. I think that I lost the mental game for sure.

Dr. Dixon:

Oh-

641:

And-

Dr. Dixon:

... that's interesting.

641:

... I ... You know, they say, uh, it's not as physically challenging as it, that its may seem. It's not, it's all the mental game, just, uh, your mind not working correctly and thinking right-

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

641:

... and you lose at some point.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Uh, t-, can you tell me a time when you had to make a difficult decision during training during BUD/S and what meant, went through your mind during that decision, and can you give me an example?

641:

I don't think I thought really clearly at all. I don't really remember much of it, to be honest with you. But, like, between being too cold and too tired, I don't really remember much.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay, so-

641:

[crosstalk 00:04:43]

Dr. Dixon:

... what ... Like, did you leave the first week, or the second week, or-

641:

Uh, the second week. Uh, yeah, I guess that's a good one. I ... The day I quit, um, I, kind of, remember what was goin' through my mind. It was, kind of, like, I was happy, I was happy to-

Dr. Dixon:

You were happy to leave?

641:

You know, like, once the thought got in my mind I was, like, happy. So I said, you know, I'm just gonna send it and sent it and-

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah, it sounds like it-

641:

... went and rang the bell.

Dr. Dixon:

... was the right decision for you.

641:

Yeah, you know-

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah.

641:

... hindsight maybe not of, but at that point, yeah-

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

... so I'm happy with it.

Dr. Dixon:

Okay. Um, is there anything that you would have done differently during BUD/S?

641:

No.

Dr. Dixon:

No? Yeah, okay, and then oftentimes ... So we've interviewed a lot of people, s- some right after they graduated, some, you know, when they rolled or whatever. Uh, and what I found interesting was that a lot of people leave BUD/S, and then they go out to the fleet for a year or two, and then they come back.

641:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Dixon:

Would you think that that's something that you would possibly do or-

641:

No-

Dr. Dixon:

Okay.

641:

... I don't ... I think this is one of those stepping stones that I f-, uh, you know, enlightened me to other areas that I can find what I want to do and it doesn't have to be there.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah. No, I-

641:

So- so I-

Dr. Dixon:

... totally agree.

641:

... yeah, don't want to go back, no.

Dr. Dixon:

Was there anything that you used to help you get through, you know, what you've done so far, like, s-, phy- physical, mental, spiritual?

641:

Yeah, the mind stuff they teach you in, like, the DEP Program and the Navy teaches you, that bootcamp stuff. You definitely use that a lot and just, kinda-

Dr. Dixon:

Can you give me an example of that?

641:

Uh, like, box breathing, did that a lot, especially, like, underwater stuff and getting ready for that, 'cause that was always hard. Um, I just ... Yeah, I just ... Practicing mental techniques that they would teach me, and just tryin' to stay positive, and it helped.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay, great, thank you. And then how do you think this experience changed you as a person?

641:

Yeah, it helped me know my body can go much further than I knew it could, that's for sure, and then just made me stronger. I know a little bit more about myself.

Dr. Dixon:

Stronger mentally, or physically, or both?

641:

Um, probably not physically. I definitely can't run or push up anymore, it's been hard to get back into shape, but mentally for sure.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative), okay. And then, you know, we're tryin' to write an article that might help people who want to come to BUD/S.

641:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Dixon:

What do you wish you would've known a year ago, or what should I have asked you that I didn't ask you in this little 15 minutes that would help someone else, do you think?

641:

Nothin'. I think I was prepared well. I think, uh, like they always told me, you- you either want it or you don't, no one just quits, so you lose the will to want it and that's what happened to me. And I think this happens to anybody, they just don't want it anymore.

Dr. Dixon:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

641:

But it's-

Dr. Dixon:

And that sounds like that was the right decision for you.

641:

Yeah.

Dr. Dixon:

Yeah. Okay, great. Well that's all I have, that's perf-

CDR Ledford: So, do you mind? I'm gonna record this, because I can't keep notes as fast as you're gonna speak to me. Um-

645: Yeah, go ahead, it's all good.

CDR Ledford: Um, it's just gonna be transcribed, that's all it is. It's not gonna be passed along. It, it's kept as well, my stuff. Um, all right, so, today is January 5th, 2022. Uh, this is Andrew [Ledford 00:00:22]. I am with 645, and... so just to get started, you were with 351...

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: ... right? So, 351... And what phase did you leave in?

645: First.

CDR Ledford: First phase. What, what part of first phase was it? [crosstalk 00:00:39] First week?

645: Third day?

CDR Ledford: Third day, okay.

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: First phase, third day. So, it's about 10 weeks ago. So, can you describe a little bit about your childhood? Like parents together, siblings, where were you in the order? Sports you played, did you move around a lot? [crosstalk 00:01:06].

645: Yeah, uh, my parents were together. I have three siblings, I'm the second oldest, and, yeah, I lived in 13 houses up to this point.

CDR Ledford: 13 houses? (laughs)

645: Yes.

CDR Ledford: So, you guys moved around a little bit?

645: Yeah, a little bit.

CDR Ledford: Now, was it in the same play... same city, or did you usually, like, big moves?

645: Over three states, uh, the rest of those were within that same states.

CDR Ledford: Three states. Parents military, or?

645: Dad was Air Force.

CDR Ledford: Dad in the Air Force, okay. U.S. Air Force. Air Force brat. Um, sports, did you play any sports?

645: I wrestled in mid school... middle school, and I played soccer and basketball in high school.

CDR Ledford: Wrestled in middle school. And soccer and basketball, right? Yeah, in high school. All right. Any... and in high school... after high school, you just...

645: Uh, I just [crosstalk 00:02:12].

CDR Ledford: ... go right in... go straight... you went straight into bootcamp?

645: No, I, uh, I worked for, like, a year, and then I... A yea- year and a half, I think ish, and then I...

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

645: ... came here.

CDR Ledford: What did you do when you worked for a year and a half?

645: Um, I was a valet, a, uh, a fast food worker. Nothing crazy.

CDR Ledford: And a half, as valet. And that was in your same town? In your...

645: Yea- yeah.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. And fast food, okay. So, if you were gonna describe your personality in three traits... someone has gotta pick three traits that describe you... you pick three traits, what, what would they be?

645: Uh, that's a good question. Uh, I mean, competitive is probably one.

CDR Ledford: Competitive, okay.

645: Um... I would say... I don't know, pro-... I'm generally pretty determined, I guess. Um, a-... I mean, I would hope nice or chill or something.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Nice or chill. Okay. So, yeah, I think we've kind of answered this question already, over the last five years, prior to training, you did high school, and then you worked for a year and a half as [inaudible 00:03:46] a valet and fast food, and then you went right into bootcamp?

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Right, okay. Uh, these experi-... well, in any these... any of your experiences prior to BUD/S, um, is there any experience that kind of sticks out that shaped you? That really molded you? Something that happened and really was significant in your life?

645: Um, uh, no- nothing too much.

CDR Ledford: Really?

645: ... not really specific, you know, that I can think of.

CDR Ledford: All right. Okay. S-... pretty basic...

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: ... upbringing and move around... Okay. Um, describe your... the background that led you to join the Navy, and, and do this.

645: Like, what was my, uh, thought process behind it?

CDR Ledford: Yeah, yeah.

645: Um, I was... I mean, military was always in my family...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... so I thought that would be sick, and then, um, I don't know, I was just bored of just work and stuff. I wanted to do something, like, meaningful.

CDR Ledford: Okay. What motivates you on a daily basis?

645: Daily basis, uh, I would say just achieving stuff.

CDR Ledford: Achieving... Like what? Achieving...

645: I mean, I, I-

CDR Ledford: Having accomplished, or...

645: Yeah, just, and, I don't know. It... I don't really try to go a day without doing something.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). How would you describe your experience at BUD/S?

645: Um, hard.

CDR Ledford: Hard? How so?

645: Interesting. Uh, I mean, it was... I already said, I, I enjoyed it. It was pretty fun...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... um, as a whole. Um, just the level of, like, constant, like... I mean, you're accomplishing something every day, so, that was pretty awesome, so...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... it was pretty fun, I would say, and... but very challenging, obviously.

CDR Ledford: Challenging, yeah. What about, um... so, interaction with, uh, your classmates in your class, or with the instructors?

645: Um, how would I describe it?

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: Bless you.

CDR Ledford: Thank you.

645: Um...

CDR Ledford: Yeah, and, I'm not sure if you're cool with it, like... are you... you're good with taking of mask, 'cause I am.

645: Yeah, I'm good to go.

CDR Ledford: Okay, good, thank God.

645: Um, but yeah, I mean, classmates... it's, uh... I, I enjoyed the... I, I would say, as a whole, everyone. Um, there was a lot of dudes who, like, getting after it, so that was awesome. Instructors, um, I mean, you're, you're a little bit afraid of them, I guess...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... but, like, it was pretty, it was pretty fun. I mean, they didn't really bother me, and you have so much respect for them. As a whole, it's... they're just doing their job.

CDR Ledford: Yup. Can you tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision, uh, during BUD/S, and then what went through your mind?

645: Um, I would say it was day two. It was land portage, um, you run with a boat on your head for miles, or whatever...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... and, uh, there is one dude in there, forgot his name, but he was, he was, he was a pretty good dude, and he was just... I don't know if he was hurt or something, but he was, like, slowing us down, and you... I mean, you wanted to slow down, uh, you know, and you try... like, I tried to push him for, like, around a mile to help him stay, and then he, uh, he just wasn't keeping up, so I had to, you know, run him out, so. I'd say that was kinda unfortunate.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). How did you... how... like, how'd that happen? Like, how does that work?

645: Um, you just... you s- sprint as fast as you can to leave him. The instructors are pushing you leave... to leave him, and you just know you had to do it, so we just run and don't help him.

CDR Ledford: As a boat crew, do you guys all kind of, like, all right, let's, [crosstalk 00:08:15] let's...

645: Yeah, kinda.

CDR Ledford: ... sprint this out. So, you guys, as a boat crew, kinda talk about it and, like, hey, let's, let's do the sprint?

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Sprint it out. Um, yeah, so, what's going throu-... what was going through your mind at that point and now, later?

645: Um, I mean, in the moment I was, like, uh, I was kinda of, like, how to keep him in, but there really wasn't... [crosstalk 00:08:43]

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... that option, so...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... you just, you just run faster. It was kinda... And, uh, looking back at it, I don't really regret it at all. I mean, it was necessary and...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... for what was asked, so, I mean. I would... if I were in his shoes, I would expect others to have ran me out, so...

CDR Ledford: Interesting.

645: ... I don't... yeah, it just wasn't...

CDR Ledford: Now what, what happened with you on the third day?

645: Third day?

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: Um, I just, I hate the water. That was it, and that's all that they're... they were... so... yeah, I don't know. I had... you know, and I hated the water for a while, [crosstalk 00:09:17]

CDR Ledford: Uh-huh (affirmative).

645: ... leading up to it. I just went out so... to celebrate, 'cause I was a bitch for the water, I guess... [crosstalk 00:09:23]

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

645: ... but, uh, I'd say I was pretty over the water, you know, it's like... I don't know, I just hate, like... I don't know, for me, like, I actually know why I'm like, "Okay, I can make it through, like, the first few day-..." I don't... Just know that I was physically capable enough, then I was, like, yeah, I don't wanna swim anymore.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: So...

CDR Ledford: Swimming.

645: ... that's what I would say.

CDR Ledford: And is there anything you would've done differently?

645: Differently?

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: I... like, in BUD/S, or...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... leading up to BUD/S?

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Uh, both, actually.

645: I mean, leading up to BUD/S, I'm... if I knew I'd hate the water as much as I did before doing that, I probably would've not wasted anyone's time and went, I guess, but, uh... I don't know, I, I don't really regret it either, I guess. I don't know, but, in BUD/S, I mean... yeah, I'm not sure. I, I, I stand... I would, I would say I stand with all of my decisions. I probably would've painted my helmet better.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). (laughs) Did you...

645: I got a little beef for that.

CDR Ledford: For your helmet, yeah. Yeah, I would know. Would you consider coming back?

645: Yeah, yeah, maybe.

CDR Ledford: Yeah?

645: I would have to think harder about it.

CDR Ledford: Yeah, well, what about the water thing?

645: The water? Yeah, that's where I would have to, I would have to, uh, I don't know, accept swimming is life, I guess.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: But, yeah, maybe.

CDR Ledford: Maybe. What practices... were there any practices like spiritual, mental or physical, that you used to kinda push you through challenging times?

645: Like, in BUD/S?

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: Um, I don't know, I just felt like... like the first day in logs, I noticed I, uh, I just tried to focus on the others, you know?

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

645: It's like when you're, like, pushing, I'm like, my arms [inaudible 00:11:23], I'd be asking the guy, was like, "Hey, how are your arms?" You know? Just maybe think less with that. Um, second day, like, wha-... uh, land po. Went land portage, or whatever...

CDR Ledford: Okay.

645: ... um, I just, like, set [inaudible 00:11:35], like... 'cause, I mean, I, I think we ran at least six miles or something, but I would be, like, just run to that little, like, spot, like, 20 feet away, and I just kept doing that the whole time.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: Um, uh, and then, I mean, in ev- every morning, I mean, uh... like, like, I'm, I'm a Christian, so, like, I'm, I don't know, listen to music and stuff, and...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... get myself hyped up every morning and I-

CDR Ledford: So, you listen to, like, podcasts or [crosstalk 00:12:07] Christian music?

645: Yeah. Yeah.

CDR Ledford: [inaudible 00:12:09]

645: [inaudible 00:12:09]

CDR Ledford: One or the other, or [crosstalk 00:12:11] both?

645: Both.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Christian mu-... And you do that consistently?

645: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Music. Podcasts. [inaudible 00:12:22]. Has this experience changed you in any way, you think?

645: Yeah, I'd say so. Um, I'm, I'm definitely, like, mentally tougher... [crosstalk 00:12:37]

Speaker 3: Go ahead.

645: ... I would say.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: Um, and I, I think, uh, walking away more... I'm more, like... Like, not in, like, a bad way, but, like, I don't know, I'm, I'm more aggref-... m- more aggressive in, like, a competitive sense...

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... than I think I was going into it.

CDR Ledford: Interesting. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: So, yeah, that's what I would say.

CDR Ledford: Hmm. Are there any questions that you think, knowing what we're trying to go after here, that we should ask about getting through training, what it takes, makes someone tick to get through training? Is there any questions, if you were us, that you would ask that would help with that?

645: Um, like, I, I feel like, like, I guess, the two big questions are, like, um... Which, like, I... like, I've noticed a pattern of, like, when, when people quit and stuff... [crosstalk 00:13:36]

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

645: ... like, most of us thought about it, like, even... [crosstalk 00:13:40]

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

645: ... before BUD/S... [crosstalk 00:13:41]

CDR Ledford: Really?

645: ... I would say. Or, um-

CDR Ledford: So, like, did you think about this before BUD/S?

645: Yeah. And then, um, I don't know, I think both the why is very important, um, as... I think a lot of, like... at least what I saw, like... [crosstalk 00:13:57]

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

645: ... a lot of times the people who, like, pull out, or whatever, were, um, they were doing it for, like, other people, or other reasons... [crosstalk 00:14:05]

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

645: ... where a lot of guys who made it were just, like, I don't blame... it's just for them, and they just wanted to make it, you know? So, I would say asking whys and when did you think about leaving.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Good. Really good. Yeah, those are great questions. Awesome, all right. I think that is it for us.

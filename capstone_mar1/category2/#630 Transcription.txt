Dr. Patti:

Okay. So what is your number?

630:

630.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So I'm here with, uh, candidate 630. So let's go ahead and start then. Um, if you could just tell me what, uh, at what point did you leave, um, the BUD/S whatever?

630:

The BUD/S. Uh, I was third week of first phase and I got, I didn't quit, I got dropped for my obstacle course performance.

Dr. Patti:

Your performance-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... on the obstacle course.

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Okay, And what was the problem with that?

630:

Um, I was just really banged up, uh, sick-

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

630:

... and I just had trouble. I, you got to pass two of the three, I failed the week one, unfortunately. Passed week two and then week three, I was just worn down and, uh, had trouble with it and it didn't go my way, so.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And so then that causes you to be performance-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... dropped?

630:

Performance dropped, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So it's not you ringing the bell-

630:

Mm-mm (negative).

Dr. Patti:

... it's them saying, "Okay, you h-"

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). You go to a board and they review everything and, um, they choose to keep you or not, so unfortunately, it didn't work out, but yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And so about how long ago was that?

630:

That was, uh, gosh, we started first phase like October 1st. So it was the last class. Uh, so, gosh, I, I don't know the exact date.

Dr. Patti:

So like around the 20th.

630:

Yeah, yeah, something like that.

Dr. Patti:

20, whatever. Um, in what class were you in?

630:

351.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. All right. So, um, then h- wh- what do you do from here? Do you know yet?

630:

Um, I'm not sure yet, I'll get like a new job and go from there, so.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. All right, so now that we have that, um, tell me a little bit about like your childhood, like your siblings, if you moved or not, you know, who you lived with, like both parents-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... step pa- whatever. Birth order, that kinda stuff.

630:

Okay. Uh, I'm the oldest, I have a younger sister, uh, she's two years younger. Um, grew up, good family, both parents present. Um, so yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

630:

With a dog (laughs).

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) And where did you live?

630:

Uh, Milton, Georgia.

Dr. Patti:

Milton, Georgia. Okay, and did, did you move at all growing up?

630:

Uh, well, we were in Woodstock, Georgia when I was little and then we moved to Milton, Georgia, which is close by, uh, like outside of Atlanta.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

630:

So, uh, yeah, lived in Georgia my whole life.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So it's just your basic-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... four people growing up-

630:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

... doing all the-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... things families do. Okay. And, um, so tell me this, if you were to, if you were to meet yourself and, and you were gonna be describing yourself-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... to another person, what, how would you describe yourself, like traits or things about you that make you who you are? What makes Carter, Carter?

630:

Hard worker, uh, determined, um, risk-taker, uh, goal-setter.

Dr. Patti:

Now when you say a risk-taker, are you a risk-taker like in the way you live your life? Are you're a risk-taker in-

630:

I'd say just dreams I pursue, uh, like with this and then, uh, playing college football as a walk-on.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, you played college football?

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Where'd you go to college?

630:

At Auburn.

Dr. Patti:

Wow. That's like a great football team.

630:

Yeah (laughs).

Dr. Patti:

What position did you play?

630:

I was a safety.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, that's so cool.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And so did you play?

630:

Uh, I played a little bit, not a whole lot 'cause I was a walk-on.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

But, uh, I grew up an Auburn fan. That was my dream. So I was like, "I wanna do that." And I went and did that and then the next thing was this, so.

Dr. Patti:

So did you graduate from Auburn.

630:

I did, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That's impressive.

630:

Yeah, my dad went to school there too, so that's how I grew up an Auburn fan, so.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, and you played football there.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That's so cool.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

I have a son who's a college football player.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

So I'm little partial.

630:

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

But that is something because, you know, uh, they don't just... Even if you're a walk-on-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

.. like they don't just take anybody.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

They cut a lot of-

630:

It's tough.

Dr. Patti:

... people off-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... right?

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

But you didn't, um, try to get recruited out of high school for football?

630:

I was. I was originally at a smaller school and then, but I knew I always wanted to go to Auburn, so I transferred and-

Dr. Patti:

I got you.

630:

... took the risk of walking on there.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

630:

So.

Dr. Patti:

Serious risk.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Where did you go to the other school?

630:

Uh, West Georgia.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, yeah.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

I'm familiar with that.

630:

So I stayed in state-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

... to save money, so yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right. Wow, that's so cool. Good for you, man.

630:

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

So, okay, we got the personality traits. Okay, so then what have you done in the five years before BUD? So, of course, some of it's college and playing football, but what else?

630:

Just college and football and then, uh, I came home, lived at home and trained for this for a little bit and then came here, so.

Dr. Patti:

So when did you decide, at what point, in, I guess, your senior year or junior, when did you decide, I guess?

630:

Uh, I mean in high school, I knew I always wanted to do this, so.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

630:

But I was like, I wanted to play college football first, so I did that and then decided to come here, so.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, good for you. That's cool. Um, what do you think... Did you have anything that like shaped you or, or, I don't know, was an experience that said, "Wow, you know, I, I think, uh, because of that, I wanna become a Navy SEAL or-"

630:

Like one event or-

Dr. Patti:

Or, or a few events?

630:

Um, no, I just, I knew I wanted to serve at the highest level, so this was the hardest thing you could do and-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

... the best job you could do, so I was like, you know, something like that, but I think just always like, I'm always chasing something. So I like the pursuit of something, I guess.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

630:

Uh, so-

Dr. Patti:

The pursuit of a dream.

630:

Right. Yeah. It's like said.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

But noth- not like one specific event was I just like, "Oh, this, I'm gonna do that," so.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

630:

It was kind of just over time. And I knew I didn't wanna work like a, a desk job the rest of my life, so-

Dr. Patti:

No.

630:

.. yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Right. Okay, And so then, um, what kind of training did you do ahead of time?

630:

Um, just, just like everyone else, like running a lot, swimming a lot, push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups for days and, um-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

... yeah. Just the normal, you know-

Dr. Patti:

Just the normal [inaudible 00:06:22].

630:

Right, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Now did you go to, did you enlist to become a SEAL or did you go to OCS or-

630:

Uh, no, I enlisted. Uh, it's quicker to get a contract that way. Uh, 'cause if you go the officer route, it takes a little while, so it's just a speedier process, so. And I wanted to be an enlisted, uh, member so that's why I went that route.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. Um, so then it says, um, "Describe your background, led you to the Navy, like, you know, did you play sports?

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Did you know people that were in, in BUD, you know-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... in Navy SEALs or whatever? So we know you played football.

630:

Yeah. Um, I had a buddy I met at Auburn who was formerly in the, the community and he was like a mentor to me and stuff, so he helped me out a lot.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

'Cause he was previously here?

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

And did he play on the football team too?

630:

No, he, he did six years and then, um, now he's using his GI Bill at Auburn, so.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay, so he did his time and then-

630:

Yeah, mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

.. then he's kind of an officer.

630:

So he's an older guy, yeah, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. Um, and so then do you think you will try to come back to the SEALs?

630:

Yeah, 100%.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

630:

So.

Dr. Patti:

Everyone does that.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That's, that's great. Um, all right, so what is it when you wake up in the morning, especially like while you were in BUD-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... that kind of kept you going, kept you from just saying, "Oh, forget this-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... this is ridiculous. I'm done, (laughs) I quit?‚Äù

630:

Uh, well, I, I'd say a mixture of things like how much I like sacrificed and the work I put in just to get here. Um-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

630:

... you know, I, I knew the risk of it not working, you know, I got a college degree and all these things and it's like, "If it, if it doesn't work out, then I'm gonna do some job I don't wanna do." So that's a big motivator. Um, and then having friends in the class-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

... uh, like all my, all my roommates, we were real close, um, and, uh, the people back home that supported me. So just not one to let them down and something, those were my biggest motivators.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... right. Well, then I guess related to that, did you have some, I don't know, ritual that you did, you know, each day or whatever, like a motivational, spiritual, I don't know, meditation, I don't know, whatever? D-

630:

Uh, I don't know. I... E- everything come it's kinda quick. Uh-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

... I mean, you don't really get that much sleep, so, uh, I mean, yeah, you wake up and you, you gotta like clean your room and everything. So that's like a forced ritual, I guess.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

630:

But something I would do personally, I don't know, I, I think I would try sometimes to like put a quick song in on my ear- earbuds, like while I was cleaning my room or whatever.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

I don't know.

Dr. Patti:

Something like that?

630:

Yeah, something like that, I guess, but-

Dr. Patti:

Okay. Now, I want you to tell me about the expe- your experience of BUD-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... and like what happened and why, why are you, why did you-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... not finish. Like tell me the whole-

630:

Okay.

Dr. Patti:

... well your story.

630:

Yeah, I was, uh... I was performance dropped for the O course. I had, uh, trouble with it previously in my other class and then, um, first phases class, week three, like right before that week I failed. So you pass two of the three you can go on.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

630:

I failed week one and week three so that's why I got, um, dropped from the program. Uh, but, uh-

Dr. Patti:

But you said your other class, so did you do this-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... before or what happened?

630:

Uh, so I was, two classes before, I was, uh, like I was still here as a student-

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

630:

... and I was rolled out of that class for the obstacle course.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So you started with 349?

630:

349. Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And then you got rolled for the obstacle course?

630:

Yes. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Any obstacle in particular or-

630:

Uh, the first time it was the, the low slide, um, and then the second time it was, uh, just, um, the two I failed were two different obstacles, but yeah. The second time, it wasn't like a specific thing, so, uh, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Just your time wasn't fast enough or whatever.

630:

I just had... I had... Well, I had trouble with the high slide on my third one. Uh, but the first one, it was like the Dirty Name, um, which is something I never failed, but I-

Dr. Patti:

Wha- what is that? Uh, you have-

630:

Um-

Dr. Patti:

... to give me more. Tell me what it looks like (laughs).

630:

It's like you jump up on this like platform-

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh (affirmative).

630:

... this like little log and then you jump over the second log and you spin over it, is the Dirty Name. So, uh, that was the f- that was my first failure for that, which was a real shock to me 'cause I was, I never failed it before and it was kinda like, "Oh, wow." So.

Dr. Patti:

Did you fail it because you didn't do it fast enough or you didn't do it right or like I don't understand.

630:

I didn't jump high enough, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You didn't jump high enough.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

630:

So, um, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, that's crazy. Um, all right, so while you were at BUD/S, did you have any situations where you had to make a difficult decision and then you knew how to, to do that?

630:

Uh-

Dr. Patti:

Because often with respect to other people-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... it could be with just yourself, but-

630:

Uh, not really. Um, it was just kinda like you just constantly had one decision to make and it was just to keep going or not, I guess.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

So, I don't know if there was... I was never in like a... Yeah, I don't know.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, well, some people tell stories of like on their boat thing like one person was slower-

630:

Oh, yeah. Okay.

Dr. Patti:

... and they had to decide if tha- that person wasn't... I don't know.

630:

No, I didn't have anything with that. Uh, I was surrounded by a lot of good guys, so. But I, I have seen experiences of that with other people-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

630:

... so.

Dr. Patti:

I hear that a lot.

630:

But I, I never had, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. Then, is there anything that you would have done differently in BUD/S if you could go back and do it over again?

630:

Um, yeah. I probably would have... I was a decent runner, but I wasn't a great runner. So I think, i- it's, that's something I could have worked on and, obviously, my obstacle course, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, it's a little hard to work on your obstacle course-

630:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

... skills in the civilian world.

630:

Yeah (laughs).

Dr. Patti:

Excuse me while I-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... pole vault over this, uh, children's-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... play area.

630:

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

I mean, on a, on a... It's not like that's something-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... one can practice, but-

630:

But maybe just being better prepared in other areas would be, I would be less beat up to-

Dr. Patti:

Hmm.

630:

... perform on that, um, I guess.

Dr. Patti:

Well, yeah, 'cause probably being beat up-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... then it makes it-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... harder 'cause everything's sore.

630:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, I can imagine. I can see that. Um, and you would definitely consider coming back, that, you said that to me-

630:

Yeah-

Dr. Patti:

... before.

630:

... it's what I wanna do.

Dr. Patti:

Um, and then how do you think this whole experience changed you as a person?

630:

Um, I don't know, like I, I learned a lot. Um, I would say like you just realize like everything is like temporary. Like-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

... like your real cold a lot, but I would always tell myself like, "I'm gonna get the chance to," well, most nights, "get the chance to go to sleep and put like a hoodie on and be warm for however long." But, uh, I'd say probably that, like everything has an end. You learn that quick, quick.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

630:

'Cause it's tough. You're like going through something, you're like, "Man, this really sucks." But you know it can't go on forever, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. And like keeping that in perspective-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... in the element that-

630:

I would say that to myself a lot, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, that... Okay, and then, um, you played football, did you play any other sports, just-

630:

Uh, when I was little-

Dr. Patti:

... any sports thing.

630:

When I was little, I played a bunch of stuff like I played hockey, believe it or not-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

... down South, which was not a big thing, but I liked that. Uh, and then baseball. Um-

Dr. Patti:

The kids stuff.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Bas-

630:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

Did you play basketball?

630:

Mm-mm (negative).

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

630:

But football was like my, my true passion, so that's what I did.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. Yeah. Okay, and then, um, what, a- are there any questions that if you were doing this, like you would ask or things like we're missing because we're not asking, wha- whatever?

630:

Um, I don't know. I would say like a big thing is like I would ask like, "Were you liked by your peers?"

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

630:

Because, um, like you, you don't, I wouldn't say a lot of guys just make it through by themselves. Like if you're, you're liked by s- a lot of people, that's a good thing. So, um, because there's a lot of guys that you see real quick like no one likes them and-

Dr. Patti:

Never make it.

630:

Yeah. And that's not a good thing. So I would say that's probably a good question.

Dr. Patti:

Were you liked by your peers?

630:

Oh, yeah, I'd say so.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

630:

I, I had a lot of good buddies make it, so, you know, I'm happy for them.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right, right.

630:

So yeah.

Dr. Patti:

I don't think you can be a college football player if you're not good with your peers.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

That's such a team sport, for sure. Um, okay, well, so this is not on my list, but I'm, I'm just curious. Um, another guy said to me when I asked that question about, he said something along the lines of, I don't remember how he said it, but, um, doubting yourself-

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

... like almost that idea of like, "Am I really good enough to do this?"

630:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Um, did that ever enter your mind?

630:

I think it probably enters everyone's minds. It's just something you gotta like shut out, you know.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

630:

Because you're gonna find out one way or another I guess (laughs). So-

Dr. Patti:

Right, right-

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... if you shut out the d-

630:

Right.

Dr. Patti:

... the doubt monster.

630:

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay. Did you have any other questions or thoughts or anything?

630:

Not that I can think of.

Dr. Patti:

Um, so I should stop this.

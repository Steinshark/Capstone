CDR Ledford: All right. Are you okay if I record? This is just so I can keep notes.

643: All right.

CDR Ledford: I can't write as fast as you speak. All right. Um, so today is January 5th, 2022. This is Andrew Ledford. I'm here with number 643. And when did you, when did you leave phase?

643: Uh-

CDR Ledford: Like, what phase?

643: ... I was at my second class with 351, uh, the last week of BO.

CDR Ledford: Last week of BO, BO. So, what class did you start with?

643: 349.

CDR Ledford: 349. When did you leave 349?

643: I got, the class had too many people and so I got rolled right before we phased up.

CDR Ledford: Oh, geez. Too many people. How many people were in the class?

643: Uh, it was, we started with 300 at BO and then-

CDR Ledford: Wow.

643: ... got down to like 240 by the end of BO. And they needed 100 and like 79, 180 or something. And so-

CDR Ledford: Wow.

643: ... 60 people just got rolled right outta the gates.

CDR Ledford: How many people are in 351 to start with?

643: Uh, I think 304 or something and everybody in 351 who would've classed up, classed up. So they either, they either dropped before they started phase. So they, your dropped in BO-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... or just classed up. So nobody, nobody got a role that I know of, but unless it was like a medical thing, but there was no performance roles, there was no administrative roles. It was just, you either dropped or you were in the class.

CDR Ledford: Wow. So when you, when you left, how many were in the class? I mean, still 300?

643: It was, no, so I was by that time, we were close to like the a hundred and something people.

CDR Ledford: Oh, really?

643: Yeah. That, that BO had more people drop than any other before, like that, I know of those, they were just comfortable gone. Normally you, you lose, like, I don't know for just actual DORS-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... its maybe 20 or 30 or something, but, that one was basically the attrition rate. Got them down to the class size that they needed.

CDR Ledford: Wow.

643: That I know of. I mean, there, there could be some, some outliers, but...

CDR Ledford: 10 weeks ago. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about your childhood, like, did you have siblings, your parents together? Did you move around a lot?

643: Yep-

CDR Ledford: Sports?

643: ... I had, uh, an older brother and older sister, uh, moved in the same place, you know, moved a little bit, like one time. But, for the majority of my life grew up in the same place. Uh, played a lot of sports, played football, baseball, soccer, uh, wrestling was my biggest sport from middle school until high school until I graduated that was the only sport I ever did.

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

643: Um, yeah, pretty standard.

CDR Ledford: All right.

643: Parents were together.

CDR Ledford: Parents together.

643: Good family.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Um, this sounds weird, but uh, like corporal punishment, like spankings or any timeouts or like, how did your parents discipline?

643: Uh, I think when I was, I think, I think one time they like spanked me-

CDR Ledford: Uh-huh (affirmative).

643: ... when I was really little. Um, but, I mean, I've been grounded before and nothing, nothing out of the blue.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: Nothing crazy, but it's just kind standard stuff.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Okay. If you had to describe your personality with three traits, what would they be?

643: Um, quiet, professional and integrity.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Integrity.

643: Or, reserved I guess would be better. Not just quiet, but...

CDR Ledford: Yeah, reserved, got it. So going back five years before BUDS, what did you do? Did you go from high school straight to BUDS or?

643: No, I graduated from high school, went to college. I got a Navy ROTC scholarship.

CDR Ledford: Where'd you go?

643: I went to, uh, University of Colorado Boulder.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Okay. And then with ROTC, in ROTC, you were there four years?

643: I was there for three years and I was fortunate my unit had, um, a officer candidate there who was a SEAL. And then, so I got, he was in a lot of my classes in the engineering program. And so I got to, you know, get to know him pretty well and just pick his brain about the community. 'Cause the whole reason I joined ROTC was 'cause I thought that was the best route to go, like become an officer and become a SEAL.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And then when I got there, he was like, no, it's not the best way to go, like, you should definitely enlist. If you're trying to be a SEAL, you should definitely enlist.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: It's like the, increased your odds of success a lot more. And then, um, like two years in, we got a new advisor there who is actually currently the OIC of SQT, um, and he was the same thing. Like, I picked his brain and eventually I realized it was like, you know what? I, I tried to go to SEAL's didn't get picked up for it.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And so finally like, well, you know, I'd rather at the very least enlisted jobs that I wanna do-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... would be better than the alternatives of an officer side. So I talked to him and he was like, yeah, that makes most sense, if you're trying to be a SEAL, then you should definitely probably drop the program and go enlist instead. So that's what I did. I jumped in program and then got my degree, and then, and basically, basically right after I got out of the program, I started talking to a recruiter. And so for the last like year and a half or two years, I was actually finishing my degree and getting ready to enlist.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. So you dropped from an ROTC, but you, you stay there at school, finish school?

643: Yep. Got my degree.

CDR Ledford: What was your de- degree in?

643: Mechanical engineering.

CDR Ledford: Mechanical engineering. There are a lot of guys who, so it's gotta be because of, um, the advisor there, a lot of guys from, uh, Boulder who wanna go SEALs right there?

643: Uh, yeah, there are a lot, got a couple, I got a buddy who was in my ROTC unit who was with, I dunno if you talked to him, he started with, he started with 342 I think and got rolled to 343. And he's at team 10 now-

CDR Ledford: Hmm.

643: ... but...

CDR Ledford: Yeah, I just I've heard that school come up quite a bit.

643: Yeah.

CDR Ledford: Okay. So high school, Boulder, and then you finished school and then enlisted right in after school?

643: Uh, yeah. I talked to the recruiter in Colorado and started, you know, started the damn thing and then COVID happened and so all the school shut down, they're trying to get, send kids home. And so I went back to, I'm from Tennessee, so-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... I went back to Tennessee. And, then switched from the Colorado DEP pool to the Nashville one.

CDR Ledford: Okay.

643: Finished over the last year.

CDR Ledford: Okay. And finished school and then went right in to boot camp.

643: Yeah. Finished, finished school and then it was like another like year or something 'cause they weren't taking SEAL candidates at that point. Like they stopped taking PSTs for COVID and so it was just kind of in limbo and they were trying, everybody would be like, they kept calling me, try to see if I wanted switch to air or switch to some other raid or go, go or something.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: I was like, I mean, I gave up my commission to do this.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: I'm not gonna take anything else. So we just kept, uh, just waiting and then finally got to take a PST and then got my shift date and then went to bootcamp in twenty- February of 2021.

CDR Ledford: Bootcamp.

643: So graduated May, 2020. And by that time I was back in Nashville or got back in Tennessee and then shipped February 2021.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Of your experiences prior to BUDS, were there any that were kind of life changing that molded you in particular?

643: Um, I mean just probably wrestling, if anything.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: I, I wanted to do a SEAL or some sort of like special operations since I was little. And at that point it was just kind of do what I thought was gonna set me up the best for success. Like mentally and character wise. My dad was like, you should definitely wrestle. And like I was fortunate, their area I'm from, from had a lot of army Rangers and green Berets-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... and one of my, my sisters, my sister was a Irish step dancer for a little bit. And her teacher's husband was a SEAL and talked to him a little bit. I mean, as much as a-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... eight year old could talk to them and got a little bit information, kind of put the idea in my head. And then as I got older, you know, by virtue of whatever experiences I had kind of started leaning towards the SEAL thing more than any other and then started wrestling and did that. And you know, there was a couple instances where, you know, I remember one thing that I remember the most that made me like really know that this is what I wanted to do was there was a day at wrestling practice where we had a kid who had cerebral palsy, who was [inaudible 00:09:32], he was like the manager of the team or something.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And some kid was like, like picking on him and like just trying to wrestle him just to 'cause he thought it was funny and messing him. And I, it made me really mad and whenever just like stopped the kid and you know, head through him or whatever-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: The kid, the kid with Cerebral palsy came up later and just thanked me for, you know, looking out for him.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: And I, I guess that's one thing that really was like, yeah, this is kind I want to do. But apart from that, I mean, yeah, just wrestling, being tough and building character and you know, tenacity. And then I guess when I was in ROTC, I was lucky I got to do a, one of their little exposure weekend things-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... like the screener thing. And that was super awesome. That was a lot of fun. I, I know there were a lot of guys who were here, there's a guy in my original class, 349, who was in my BO crew for that. And that was basically just kind of two days of BUDS or hell week or whatever.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Where was that at? Boulder.

643: [crosstalk 00:10:32].

CDR Ledford: Oh, oh yeah. They brought you here.

643: Different units came from-

CDR Ledford: That's right.

643: ... to come here.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: So that was cool. And I had done, I had done one before with um, a couple guys from my unit, like one of the guys who had CLT 10 was there with me. Um, and then I did the second one, it was me and another buddy of mine. Who's uh, a SWO officer right now. As far as I know, still trying to come here and that transfer.

CDR Ledford: When did you do that? The screener?

643: Uh, the first one was my junior year.

CDR Ledford: Okay.

643: Or no, sorry. First one was sophomore year. And so that would be 20-

CDR Ledford: Interesting

643: ... 17 and the second one was 2018.

CDR Ledford: And so you didn't have to be a, a junior or a sophomore.

643: No.

CDR Ledford: Like they said, anyone who wants to go can go.

643: Yeah. And well, that's, you have to... Yeah. Basically you have to, well, you have to like send a little application-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... in PST score or whatever, and then if you, is good enough, then they'll let you come.

CDR Ledford: Great. How do you feel like those experiences impacted training here?

643: Training here?

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: It was fine. I mean I knew what to expect, like I knew what it was gonna be like. The only thing was for me, the biggest thing was my fitness. I, at such a small, you know, level like the two days is when you get to feel like, okay, this is how, kind of how it works, but you don't see over the long term, like-

CDR Ledford: Yeah

643: ... the kind of shape you need to be in on the front end to, to be able to ride that out. 'Cause you get broken down-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... as you're here. Like you'd say, I know very few people who, especially in first phase, by the end of even the first week are better than they were before they started. I mean, everybody just gets broken down the whole point of it.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: And so it's kind of like, if you are at a certain point, if you have, are stellar fitness wise, then you can really ride that out. And then obviously certain factors of like your fortitude will help carry you longer, but it's definitely helps to have that buffer. And I was not anywhere near as prepared as I should have been on the front end. So, you know, just by virtue of the process, you kind of, get grinded down and broken down-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... and don't have a whole lot of opportunity to get built back up. And so it was kind of that point I realized, about 351 I realized was like, you know, I, at what little time I could with PTRR, you know, I got a lot of taskings and tried to make the most as training that I had, you know, if I had a tasking, I would wake up at like 3:30 in the morning and go run nine miles and then go do my tasking, then go work out at night.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: Like I would try to figure out what I could. And then in like three weeks of that, it was a span of however long I was rolled for, I was like, doesn't really go that far.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: But you know, it's my own fault for not preparing off on the front end.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. I think you, you already described your background that led you to join the Navy.

643: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

CDR Ledford: Um, what motivates you on a daily basis?

643: Just give us right. Serve God, do something good that makes it a little better and other people's life easier and just do the best of my ability.

CDR Ledford: Okay. That's good. How would you describe your experience at BUDS?

643: It's like [inaudible 00:13:52] on ceremonies.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). How so?

643: Just, uh, you know, you hear so much about it and like it's all these mythic tales and you get here and really see kind of, it's like, oh, it's just, you know, BUD/S is BUD/S, like you just, kind of, get beat down all the time and there's tests that you gotta do, but there's nothing like, I don't know. It just seemed like a, you know, people were expecting to be like dying at BUD/S, like [crosstalk 00:14:18] barely be alive. And you're like, oh no, it's, it's definitely doable. Like, there's, there's aspects that will really help you and there's, sometimes there's just things that just happen to people. And like, you know, it's, there's a certain amount of luck that's involved and it's, kind of like, you know, if you make it, you make it and if you don't, you don't.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: You know, just do what you can and give your best shot.

CDR Ledford: How would you describe the, uh, interaction with your class, interaction with the instructors?

643: The class is good. I mean, there was some times where it, kind of, got silly, turned into like, kangaroo courts, you know, not, not necessarily the most healthy environment.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: But on like, a personal level, it's fine. I mean, everybody was supportive and friendly as far as I knew, unless, unless you like, did something where you're, kind of, a turd and everybody hated you, which should be like, if you did something that was really stupid or you were just grossly messed up and everybody's like, "That was extremely dumb, you should probably leave." But, you know, if you're, if you're a good guy and you work really hard and, you know, you don't cause pain for the rest of class, it's fine. Like, nobody's gonna dislike you or anything.

CDR Ledford: Okay. Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision at BUDS and kind of, what was going through your mind?

643: Uh, when I decided to [inaudible 00:15:47]-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: 'Cause I had, at that point, like I said, it was, I, in my [inaudible 00:15:53] class, I was in okay shape. Like, I was nothing special. I was like probably middle, bottom half. Like, what, what's the first... yeah. Basically just a little under average.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And got rolled and was in PTRR, you know, did the workouts they had, did my best to try to stay in shape and get better and then come back to 351. And when we do our test gates, it was like, I had not really gotten that much better. I'd gotten worse in some aspects and gotten better in the O course, but I mean, that's just, you get more runs and you get better. And then, kind of, the whole time, I kind of, saw where I was performance wise and I was like, basically from, from prep, I had seen, I was like, okay, my performance is not necessarily the best. Like, I'm gonna have to really, kind of, gut it out here if I wanna be successful. And then, just by virtue, month by month, I kept seeing like, not really much better performance, not much better.

643: And then 351 finally came around. Uh, at that point, I kind of, knew I was going down the sinking ship. I was like, I'm either gonna have to be extremely lucky to get by and cause a lot of pain for the other guys here or figure something else out. And then, there was one day when I was on the O course and like, tweaked my shoulder and that was on, like, a Tuesday I think.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And so, that was a big red flag of like, really like, okay, I need to see what I'm doing here.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: And then, it was like, I'll take it day by day and see how it goes. And at that point, we, the next day, we got beat by the first phase instructors because some kid had like, worn improper attire to the [inaudible 00:17:29] or something and an instructor saw him. And so, the entire... That, that had never happened before. That was like, unheard of, of like, the entire, the actual phase staff coming and beating the BO class. And so, we got beat on the O course and there was a couple times where my shoulder, kind of like, gave out. And so, I was like, okay, that's not very good. And so, I was like, okay, well, we got logs tomorrow. That'll be like the real test of how's my shoulder gonna be.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: So, did that, got through that, but just barely. And like we, my BO crew was like, the dead last one. And like, we only had six dudes on the log and it was just like, we'd just get smoked. And I was like, okay. Finished the day and then basically the whole week, and I was sitting there thinking, and I was like, okay, that's, those two, Thursday and Friday were kind of like, that's the, that's what phase is it's like, and I was barely squeaking by there. And I was like, we were getting smoked. Our BO crew was getting smoked. Like, if that's how it's gonna be going, then I'm gonna be causing a lot of pain for these guys. And it's like, I don't wanna, I don't wanna be the reason other people are getting screwed up because I can't recognize that my performance is dwindling.

643: And so, I was like, look, I need to reevaluate what I'm doing here. It's like, I know what it takes now. I know what shape I need to be in. You know, if I get the opportunity to come back, then I need to make sure I'm ready and know what to do and how to be ready and how to go about doing this to be successful. Whereas, this time it was, kind of like, I was working off of what little information I had, I had from other people.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: That's what 10, 15, 20 year old information from the guys that I had talked to-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... it's different now than it used to be. So, now it's like, okay, here I know what it could be. Here's what it is right now. It's a whole spectrum of possibilities. And I just know if I am at this level, when I get here, then, you know, it's not gonna be hard to tough my way through. Because it's like, you can't, you can't wheel yourself to a sub 32 4 mile-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... if you're not good enough shape. Or you can't wheel yourself to like, you know, what, what's a good like, squat, however much weight that is required to get through BUDS if you're just not there physically.

CDR Ledford: Yeah. Yeah.

643: So, it's kind of like, you realize, okay, there is a certain component of physicality required like a base level that you need to have to be successful. And there's, depending on how much you have, you know, you can have varying degrees of success. And this thing is like, even with my first class, if I had, if I had gotten classed up, I would've probably just gotten through by the skin of my teeth, if I did. Like, I, I there's, I could've totally just toughed it out, but what would've happened to other people, if I had been there to toughen it out, just being super stubborn about not making it? It's like, if I would've hurt other guys, develop bad reputation, instructors would've hated me, classmates would've hated me and then get to the teams and got this awful reputation and nobody wants to work with you. And what's the whole point of doing it if you're not even gonna be able to do the job?

CDR Ledford: Yeah. That was good. So like, is there anything you would've done differently?

643: Train, train more and focused on running and leg strength. Gotten stronger, gotten faster.

CDR Ledford: Focusing on running and leg strength.

643: For sure. That's definitely the biggest things. Another thing that, in my second class, you know, BO, I mean BO's easier than phases, but it's not like a cake walk necessarily.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.

643: Dudes will get beaten down just from that. And, and by virtue of increasing my mileage from [inaudible 00:21:03], you know, I did physically, apart from my shoulder, I didn't feel bad. Like, I felt fine, but I just couldn't... My performance, the actual numbers did not get better and I was like, okay-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... this is, you know, I, there's a certain level I need to be at and I'm not at it. But I think mentally, you know, character wise, I was all there. It was just, you know, physically I was underperforming by a lot.

CDR Ledford: So, you would consider coming back?

643: I would consider it, yeah. I've, I've gotten lucky that there's gonna be, you know, some opportunities that I'll be able to use my background and skills and character to do a lot of good work in a similar capacity as I would've, as in the teams.

CDR Ledford: Like what, what will you do?

643: I'm gonna try to do CTI and then try to do TIO.

CDR Ledford: Okay.

643: And so, that's what I'm gonna try to do. I've been talking to a couple guys who were at TIO and he was saying like, the work that he's doing is better than he could have possibly imagined...

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... than when he was at BUDS. And it's like, you know, if I can do that, that I would actually be able to use my engineering degree to some extent there and be, my background and knowledge would be beneficial as opposed to in the teams, you know, like, so much I can do with engineering and-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... what, whatever else I've got. But so if, if it's giving up that to try to come back, then, you know, that would be a harder decision to make.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: But, so what, maybe I'll consider it.

CDR Ledford: Uh, what practices physical, mental, or spiritual did you use to, kind of, push through challenges?

643: The spiritual, uh-

CDR Ledford: Spiritual.

643: I just sit there and say a prayer and, you know-

CDR Ledford: And you do that consistently?

643: Yeah. All through the day.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: And then mental too. Uh, and it seems like, it's like I said, it's like, I can't just like physically will myself to be stronger than my physiology can allow me to do like, a certain amount of just... I am where I am right now and I just gotta trust the powers that be that what I'm doing is the right thing.

CDR Ledford: Okay, great. How has this experience changed you?

643: I honestly don't think it's changed much.

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: Like, just gotten more exposure and more understanding how, you know, it works and what it takes. But I think I'm kinda, the same guy I always was.

CDR Ledford: If you were asked and you knew what we were trying to get at with resilience, like kind of, what gets you through this stuff, what question would you ask if you were sitting in our shoes? Is there anything that we're, we could be asking?

643: I mean, it's, I think what you are asking is, kind of, all you can is, it's, if I know it's hard for you guys to get an insight into that and I'd say, I don't, I don't know what it would take. It's like so different on an individual level.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: Maybe something about, like, at the, whatever you're... The moment was like the hardest for you-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... you know, what was going through your mind?

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: And I mean, if you're gonna ask me that question-

CDR Ledford: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

643: ... and been in for that, the week, that Friday of the week before I quit on logs when like, my arm was already kind of shot-

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: ... and we had the first phase cadre there, just screaming at us. And my BO crew was dead last and I was on the end of the log and, you know, whoever instructor or whatever, I don't remember who it was, like, is just in my face, shoving the log, telling us that we suck. And it's like, and that's the people who are gonna be looking at you in first phase. And you're like, oh my gosh, why am I even here right now? Like, is it on [inaudible 00:25:15] and not just quitting on the spot. It was like, you know, just like whatever, just see what happens next.

CDR Ledford: Yeah.

643: That's kind of what it is.

CDR Ledford: Good. That's a good one. All right, stop this.

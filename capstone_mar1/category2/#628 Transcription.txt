Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. So I'm here with candidate, um, or person 628. Is it okay if I record this session?

628: Yes.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Thank you. So first of all, um, what phase did you leave at?

628: I left in first phase.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: First phase? And how many weeks ago did you leave? So, like, how many-

628: Um, probably a little over 12 weeks ago.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: 12 weeks ago? Okay. Do you mind if we take off our masks?

628: Yeah, that's fine.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Great. Thanks. So could you take a minute and tell me about your childhood?

628: Um-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: So I'm looking at, like, how many times did you move? Do you have a lot of sisters and brothers? Are your parents still together? Just that kind of stuff, basics.

628: Parents are still together. One sister, one brother. Never moved. Actually-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: [crosstalk 00:30:31]

628: ... we moved one time, but it was in the same town-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Yeah.

628: ... so.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Are you oldest, youngest?

628: I'm the youngest.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Youngest?

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Cool. If you had to describe your personality, uh, in three traits, what would you say?

628: Um, it's kinda, kinda tough. Um-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: It is hard, right?

628: ... [crosstalk 00:30:53] thought about it.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: But if you, like, if your best friend were to describe you, what would he or she say?

628: (Laughs) Again, I don't even... Uh, I guess... Uh, introverted, maybe.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: Um, tough.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: Uh, determined.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Those are good traits. Exactly, that's exactly what we're looking for, just kinda summation of your personality. Um, so what did you do in the last five years prior to this training?

628: I played college football.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Where did you go? Where did you play?

628: I, I went to Missouri Western.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Missouri Western, okay. That seems like they're all working. Okay. And then so you did college... So you then you're fifth year would've been, um, in high school? Or did you take a year off after high school?

628: No, I did five years of college.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Five years of college?

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Cool. And what was your degree in?

628: I've a bachelor's in accounting and master's in forensic accounting.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Wow. That's cool. That's really neat. I teach in the business school at my school-

628: Okay.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: ... University of Tampa, so.

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: I just think that's we-... it's always hard to get accounting people.

628: Yeah. I, I always liked that, I was always good at it.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Yeah, that's cool. Well, congrats. That's nothing easy, plus playing college football at the same time, that's hard.

628: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: I played, um, a sport in college. I know how much time that takes.

628: Yeah, yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: So-

628: It was a lot of time.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: That's great. So, um, if you think of all your prior experiences that you've had, would you think that there's anything, one or two things, that shape out as really having an effect on you? Like, life-shaping experiences?

628: I don't know, 17 I, uh, I guess I always had it, but I got diagnosed with alopecia.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

628: So that's whenever... it's an autoimmune disease that pretty much kills your hair.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Wow, okay.

628: It, it think it's harmful to your body so your white blood cells just kill it. So I was pretty much bald in high school.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Uh-huh (affirmative). That was-

628: Yeah, that was pretty tough.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: So what did that... how, how did that i-, uh, im-, how did that have an impact on you as a person and in your training at all?

628: Um, I kinda just... I guess I kinda just changed the way I was living, kinda started, I mean, I started working out to, to just feel better about myself. And then just got tougher mentally and physically.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

628: That's, I mean, that's pretty much it. That's how it changed me.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. No, that's, that's great. So what was in your background? Describe what in your background led you to come into the Navy, to join the Navy.

628: Um, well, my grandpa was in the Navy. And then I know not many other people in my family have been in the military, and I just always kinda felt like it was something that people should at least do for one contract is at least serve your country for a little bit.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Great, excellent. Did you feel like he expected that or is this-

628: No.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: ... something you just wanted to do?

628: Yeah. My grandpa passed away when I was younger, so I never really got the chance to talk about it with him. But-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: ... I kinda just felt, just felt like it was something that people should do.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Good. Um, what do you think motivates you on a daily basis?

628: Uh, probably just don't wanna let myself down or let my family and friends down.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. That's excellent. Um, tell me about your experience at BUD/S.

628: It was tough. Um, didn't really seem like there was much of a teamwork aspect. It more felt like it was every man for himself, like, even within the boat crews, which is-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: That's unusual it seems.

628: Yeah, it's not really what I was expecting, I guess.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: But what class were you in?

628: 351.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. I've heard that from that class.

628: Yeah. It's just not what I was expecting at all.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mmm. So that was very different than what you came in looking maybe, you know, what, what were you originally looking for?

628: I mean, I just kinda just figured that the SEALS are just a, like the best team in the world. I figured that even though the training's gonna be ridiculously hard, you'd at least be able to, like, fall back on the rest of your, the rest of the people, like, going through the pipeline. Like, to... I don't know. Like, kinda wanted to work together-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

628: ... I guess. But it was never really like that.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Okay. Tell me about a time when you had to, to make a difficult decision during training at BUD/S. What went through your mind during that decision, and can you give me an example?

628: Um, well, this was in [inaudible 00:36:00].

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: Uh, we were doing... We were actually getting, um, beat by the first phase instructors 'cause people just kept messing up. So they, they were beating us, and then they said, "Pick up your buddy," or like, "Get a buddy," and like carry him to the shore. And then come back. Well, the guy that picks me up was going and he just, like, put me down and said he was done. But essentially, like, he didn't do anything else. Like, he, he didn't go over to the instructors or finish. He just, like, looked at me, saw, I mean, instead of getting us both beat, I just picked him up and then pretty much had to do, like, double.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Wow. Okay. That was a good example, then, of somebody not-

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: ... being a team player.

628: Yeah. That's... That was pretty much like the majority of my experiences.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Wow, that's not what I was expecting.

628: No.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Wow. Okay. Um, is there anything you would've done differently if you had to do BUD/S ever again?

628: Um, well, I, I, I probably would've waited, like, tried to commission as an officer and then gone through.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay.

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: That makes sense. Um, a lot of people that we interview, um, so we interviewed before COVID, all the people who graduated. And now we're coming back, and even the people who have not yet graduated. And a lot of those people said, or they have... they had not made it through BUD/S for one reason or another. And then they were in the fleet for a year or two, and then they came back to BUD/S. Is that something you would ever consider?

628: I don't think so-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: ... honestly.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: No. That's what we're looking for. Honesty, yeah.

628: Yeah, I don't think I would.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. And could you tell me why or-

628: I just wouldn't wanna... I don't know how, like, the, the whole contract status would work. I don't wanna risk doing even more years and then coming back and then having the same exact experience.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Right. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. So were there any practices that you used, like physical, mental, spiritual, to push through the challenges that you had in BUD/S?

628: Um, well, well in [inaudible 00:38:29] like whenever we were getting search tortured, I'd always manage to get next to my buddies and we would just make jokes about how cold it was. Like, to just get us through it. I would always call my parents at the end of the night and just talk to 'em a little bit.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

628: Aside from that, it wasn't much.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mmm. So how do you think this experience changed you as a person?

628: Um, I mean, it's given me a new perspective on, I guess, what it's like in... I mean I don't even... I don't really know if it's a good gauge of what it's like. But it seems like the majority of people that I talk to didn't have, like, similar experiences at all. I don't really know how it's changed me. I guess I'm... I, I mean, I, I really don't know at this point.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay.

628: I think it's a little, like, too soon-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Right.

628: ... to see how it's changed me.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. Well, is there anything I should've asked you? So we're, we're writing these articles for people that maybe haven't been to BUD/S before, and trying to help them be as successful as they can be.

628: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Is there anything I should've asked you or anything you wish you would've known before you came?

628: Uh, I mean, I, I would've wished I would've known that, uh, that you should really just take as much time as possible before you get here to be ready. I mean, that, that would obviously, like, make sense. But I feel like, in a sense, like, people get caught up on, like, the, the whole age restriction thing, and then they just start pushing to go a little bit sooner than they really should.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

628: Like, that was the whole reason I didn't commission as an officer is 'cause I didn't want to have to wait, like, a year-and-a-half-

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Mmm.

628: ... to go in. But, in reality, it really wouldn't have mattered.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: It's hard to know that, though when you're-

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: ... just in the throw of it, right? And you're wanting to get... accomplish what you're looking to do.

628: Yeah.

Dr. Deirdre Dixon: Okay. Okay. Well, that helps. Well, let me turn these off.

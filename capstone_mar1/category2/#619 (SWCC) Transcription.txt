Dr. Patti:

Yeah, okay. Perfect. All right, so now I have- this is kind of my question, so I'll just kind of ask them to you, and if you don't give me enough information I'll bug you and say, "okay, I need more about that". So the first question is, to talk a little bit about your childhood and what, you know, kind of where you grew up, your family, sport, you know, just whatever.

619 (SWCC):

Um, I grew up in predominately L.A.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

I moved around a little bit. I think I would say [inaudible 00:00:30] Inglewood area, and then after that I moved to Compton, and that's where I live to this day.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

With my mom. Um, growing up I had a good childhood. You know, great parents, great mom. Um, one thing I would say, growing up, never had any hardships. Everything was pretty much given to me. And wasn't rich.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

But I wasn't really poor. I was just like... I would say I was poor, but I mean, I never knew I was poor.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Right.

619 (SWCC):

You know, my parents never made me feel that I was poor. It was just like a... I felt normal the whole time.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

And there was never a time where I felt like, yeah, life was hard. You know-

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

... like it sucked, you know?

Dr. Patti:

So w-who's in your family?

619 (SWCC):

Um, it's me and my mom, and my step dad.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And has the step dad been there the whole time, or?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, actually, uh, he's been my father figure since the very beginning. Like I've never really got to know my biological father.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

Um, yeah, he's just been that role the whole time, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And you're- so you're an only child?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Basically.

619 (SWCC):

Only child.

Dr. Patti:

Right, of those people.

619 (SWCC):

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So that's awesome. All right, now did you play any sports, or anything like that? Any sports?

619 (SWCC):

I've been very familiar with all sports. I've always played sport my whole life.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

I've always been, in a way, you could say like active or play outside, stuff like that. I was never officially in a team, high school team, middle school team, elementary. Actually, I was, actually. When I was a young kid, I played, what? Soccer.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

That's about it.

Dr. Patti:

Like on one of those like city league things?

619 (SWCC):

Like, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Okay.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, pretty much.

Dr. Patti:

That all parents put their kids in?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah. And actually, you know what, when I was, well, a teenager, I did play also in a city league too. Like, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

But that's it. That's it. Pretty much, like never was- was never really, you know, like really good or, you know, in a club, no.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right. So you've just been through high school, and play- did the high school stuff-

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

... and that was that?

619 (SWCC):

Pretty much, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And di- so birth order, there is no birth order because you're, um, w- you are an only kid. Yeah. Okay. So, um, if you had to describe your personality, in, you know, some traits, what would you call your- what would you say about yourself?

619 (SWCC):

Uh... that's a tough one. Um, I would say that it has changed over the years.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

Um, obviously I'm the same person now as I was like growing up. I'd saying growing up I was more insecure, timid in a way. But challenge was always a thing that like I liked, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

I noticed that no matter what, like it was a fight that I enjoyed. You know, like just never gave up, stuff like that. Um, now it's like it's different. Like I don't mind changes, you know, like I can adapt to like anything.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

It's like, whatever.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

You know, what happened here in a pipeline, you know, you know, it happened.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

You know, I know I can live with that, because I know that like, you know, I want to come back, and stuff like that.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

619 (SWCC):

Um, you know, whatever happens in life now, I've just got to, you know, work it out. You know, find my way and, you know-

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

... come back, and stuff.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

I don't know if that was an answer [crosstalk 00:03:53]

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, yeah. Well, so what- w-what made you leave, um, BUD/S?

619 (SWCC):

Um, so I made it past tour. I mean, I actually did BCS, I didn't actually go through BUD/S.

Dr. Patti:

I don't know what BCS is.

619 (SWCC):

BCS is basically SWCC training. So there's, uh, SEAL training-

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

... which is BUD/S. And there's SWCC training, which is BCS, Basic Crewman Selection. It's also selection course.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, so I...

Dr. Patti:

So you went to basic training, is that right?

619 (SWCC):

Right.

Dr. Patti:

And then after basic training you came here?

619 (SWCC):

I ca- uh, well, no, uh... so, yeah. Basic training I went to prep still in Chicago.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

Or still over there. And then I came over here.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

To San Diego prep.

Dr. Patti:

And BSC, I guess that proceeds BO? Is that correct?

619 (SWCC):

Yes, it's after BO. Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

So basically, uh-

Dr. Patti:

After BO or before?

619 (SWCC):

After BO. So basically, uh, um, SEAL and SWCC had it, do BO together-

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

... and then they go into respective selection courses-

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

Which is BUD/S and then BCS.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And so you went to BCS?

619 (SWCC):

Yes.

Dr. Patti:

And then would you- then from BCS, if you would have stayed in and th-then you'd go to BUD/S, or? W-w- I don't understand.

619 (SWCC):

So... okay, so (laughs), okay-

Dr. Patti:

Sorry.

619 (SWCC):

No, no. I'm about to explain. So for a SEAL pipeline it's BO. They have first phase, second phase, third phase, and then, uh, SQT.

Dr. Patti:

SQT, uh-huh.

619 (SWCC):

SEAL qualification training. And then for, uh, SWCC training you have BO, BCS, BCT, CQT, Crewman Qualification Training.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, so ultimately you were not going to be a SEAL?

619 (SWCC):

I was not going to be a SEAL.

Dr. Patti:

You were going to be a...

619 (SWCC):

Uh, for a SWCC.

Dr. Patti:

A SWCC?

619 (SWCC):

It- it's for, uh...

Dr. Patti:

S-W-I-C-K?

619 (SWCC):

No, SWCC. Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewman.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. And- and how does that...

619 (SWCC):

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) What is that? I mean, I- I know what SEALs do, but I don't know-

619 (SWCC):

Uh...

Dr. Patti:

... I've never heard of the SWCC thing.

619 (SWCC):

SWCC is a very like, it's not really known yet, they're still growing at this moment. Matter of fact, the pipeline is still changing.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

Like as we speak, it's still changing right now, it's getting harder and harder every day. Like, you know, it's, uh, um, the training that my instructors went through, that I went through was different.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

They're both rigorous. Like SO pipeline and SWCC pipeline are both rigorous pipelines, where they both demand-

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

... you know, a lot of physical, you know...

Dr. Patti:

Impossible tasks, yeah.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, tall tasks, you know, a lot. But it's different. You know, they're both respectively in their own way hard, right?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Um...

Dr. Patti:

Tell me what does SWCC stand for again? Special...

619 (SWCC):

Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewman- crewman.

Dr. Patti:

Special warfare combatant craft...

619 (SWCC):

Crewman.

Dr. Patti:

Crewman. What's the W- the I?

619 (SWCC):

No, no, uh, it's just S.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, it's just SWCC?

619 (SWCC):

SWCC, SWCC. Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay, no I in there?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. All right. I was curious. Well, because we have these papers and some of them say BCS, or whatever, and I'm like, none of us knew what that was.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, so B- BCS stands for basic, uh, crewman selection.

Dr. Patti:

Ah, okay. Okay. So your goal was to become, uh, this SWCC?

619 (SWCC):

Yes.

Dr. Patti:

And not to become a SEAL?

619 (SWCC):

Not to become a SEAL.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. All right. Got that. Now- now we can move on.

619 (SWCC):

Not my lifestyle, respectively (laughs).

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

Respectively.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Well that's okay, at least I understand better. Because I'm- you're using these terms, I'm like, I don't even know what he's talking about.

619 (SWCC):

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

Okay. So your personality traits.

619 (SWCC):

Okay.

Dr. Patti:

Did we talk about those yet?

619 (SWCC):

Is there anything specifically you like, uh-

Dr. Patti:

Well, I just want to know like do you- do you think you're, you know, a happy person? Are you quiet, are you loud, are you, you know, the life of the party, or...

619 (SWCC):

That depends greatly. Uh, uh, that really does like... yeah. I'm a happy person. It's just something that, you know-

Dr. Patti:

You're a what person?

619 (SWCC):

A happy person. Definitely a happy person.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, you seem very happy.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah. Uh, that's just something that I've learned throughout time. I- I just learned that, you know, throughout life it's just you're going to have misfortunes, you know. Things are just going to happen. But guess what? Like everyone's life is hard, respectively. You know?

Dr. Patti:

Absolutely.

619 (SWCC):

And you're always like, everyone has obstacles, everyone has downfalls and everyone has, you know, certain things where you know what, oops, like you start over. You know?

Dr. Patti:

Absolutely.

619 (SWCC):

It happens.

Dr. Patti:

Happens to all of us.

619 (SWCC):

So it's like, you know, there not- at the same time I'm not trying to say that like, oh, like I- I- I can't feel sorry for myself.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, of course I can. But it's like, you know, it could always be worse. So it's like, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Oh, yeah. Absolutely. You- that's a great energy you have.

619 (SWCC):

That's what keeps me going, you know? That's what keeps me going. And I know that I still got a life in me that, you know, I can do what I want to do, so.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's like that's the attitude, I think. So in the last five years, before you came to BUD/S, like tell me what were you doing? Um, like, you know, were you in college, were you in high school? Were you, I don't know, whatever, working at UPS? You know.

619 (SWCC):

Uh, I was going to college. I was going to a communal- community college.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

At the time my goal was to, uh, transfer to university, to ultimately get a degree in criminal justice or fire science.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

Because I was trying to become a firefighter, or someone in law enforcement, or FEDS, like a marshal or something.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, cool.

619 (SWCC):

Uh, at the time it was different. Uh, it was pretty hard too, because I was a part of the smaller people, like you know, I was a pretty small physique.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

And at the time, uh, if you become a firefighter everybody was pretty big and the training was pretty tough. And at the time I wasn't really training to be strong. It was- it's a whole different thing.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

I was more focused on school and all that stuff, like and so like failure was very much a bigger thing at that time.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

And so I got very easily discouraged there. You know, like I said, it was a different time. It was a different time. And that time, that's when I started looking at like the Navy, because I knew like, oh I want- I want to be military as well, [inaudible 00:09:43] in the military.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

It wasn't- so I actually- actually started training for SWCC until like my- my- my, um, personality or my morale started to change, I guess. I don't know.

Dr. Patti:

And what m-made that change? Like what made you decide, wake up one morning, oh, I want to train for SWCC?

619 (SWCC):

Um... it was pretty funny. Uh, just like online, like, yo, like, um, what do I want to do? It's like, I want to go into Navy, but I don't just want to be in it, I want to do something really cool, like something, you know, dope.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

And so I started looking. I saw SEALs, but I'm like, right off the get-go I- that's something I don't want to do. Like, no, I don't see myself being a SEAL. It's not...

Dr. Patti:

Huh.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, they're bad dudes, but like I don't see myself as a SEAL. And then I saw other programs. I saw air rescue, I saw diver, and I saw SWCC. I'm like, yo, this is badass. And I see myself on a boat, I see myself working these guns, I see myself doing all these things. You know, I'm- I'm an outside person. I don't like being in the office, I like being outdoors-

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

... doing crazy things. That's my attitude, that's the way I am. You know, so I'm like, you know what, this is what I want to do. And so like, for a while, you know, I put it off the side, because I kept going to school. Until like one day like I saw my life going nowhere, like I said, like I was like failing all over the place.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

I did EMT. I did, uh, got my cert- sort of like certificate of completion.

Dr. Patti:

Right. Uh-huh.

619 (SWCC):

And I got my, uh, license or whatnot.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

It's like not a license, but you pass the test [crosstalk 00:11:15]

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Certification, so you can do it, yeah.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah. And I got it, but I wasn't going. I wasn't going to apply to none of these agent- like places, to be start working as an EMT. And it's like, why am I pushing off? Why?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Like, and it's like, well, I notice I am doubting myself. I'm doubting myself as an EMT, that could actually fulfill this job. I feel like I'm not able to do it.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, wow.

619 (SWCC):

Even though-

Dr. Patti:

You're doubting yourself.

619 (SWCC):

I was doubting myself.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

Even though I passed this course with flying colors. You know, obviously it's one thing doing the books and real life, it's black and white. But it's like, the doubt factor was huge.

Dr. Patti:

Huh.

619 (SWCC):

And then it wasn't- so I started training for SWCC, where like, um, it was simple. Like simple things like, oh, wake up in the morning. You know, if I said I was going to do this, this is what I'm going to do, you know? And it was just little things like that that just started-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

... building up and building up and building up. You know, like so you know, I started meeting new people, I started working out with, um, a partner. He taught me how to run. I started running more and more miles, more miles. You know, and I got faster, I got better. You know, [inaudible 00:12:22], same thing. Like I pushed myself to my limit, you know, every- like every other day. And it's just like, it didn't stop. It was like a high that I liked.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

I mean, and sometimes like I lie, it wasn't a thing that I liked doing, like I hated my work as I created-

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh.

619 (SWCC):

... because it sucked.

Dr. Patti:

Huh.

619 (SWCC):

But I knew that it will make me harder, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, the feeling afterwards.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, you know. And, uh, that mindset just never went away, you know? And yeah, that's what brought me all the way here.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

It got me through the tour, it got me through the hardest part of selection, I guess you could say.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

619 (SWCC):

I didn't get past selection, but I got past the hardest part, so it was like, uh, I guess tour is the equivalent to, you say, hell week. And, um...

Dr. Patti:

Right. So w-what happened? What caused you to stop in BCS?

619 (SWCC):

So post tour, um, you do... there's like a week where you go underway, you work on the CRCs. I don't know, I forgot what they stand for, but it's like-

Dr. Patti:

Is that like a boat, or?

619 (SWCC):

... little- little ribs with like little motors?

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

And you ride them out, you learn how to, you know, park them and just like maneuver them-

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

... um, across the bay. Um, then after that, in the last week you do your final like a test out in the water rescue. And well, basically a water rescue is, it's basically you swim up 35 meters, and you're supposed to collar-toe an instructor 10 meters, and then cross chest 25 meters.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

It's a really rigorous (laughs) uh...

Dr. Patti:

It's like a lifeguard sort of thing, yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

... evolution. Uh, it's like a lifeguard-

Dr. Patti:

But it's way harder, I'm sure.

619 (SWCC):

... but I would say it's- it is, because like it's not... with lifeguards, it's a very different technique, you know? You're supposed to use technique that they want you to use.

Dr. Patti:

Okay (laughs).

619 (SWCC):

And you're basically hypoxic the entire time.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

And by this point you're using full gear, full camo, cam- uh, type threes, and you're wearing a vest, like, uh, like that bullet proof vests, something like that.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. You're wearing that while you're swimming?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

And, uh, with boots. And then obviously you have some flotation device, but that can only do so much. You know, you're still restriction and you're still carrying a whole instructor, so [crosstalk 00:14:31]

Dr. Patti:

Who's probably fighting you, not just laying there nicely.

619 (SWCC):

Yes, they're fighting. Yeah. Um, so yeah, that's-

Dr. Patti:

That's what did you in, that?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, I failed the first time in class 117, I got rolled. And then I- I got rolled for a very long time, because at one point something like five classes I go through a year for SWCC, so I got- I got there at a point... where I got rolled at a point, where there was no class for SWCC that went on.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

So I was two months in limbo, just training and just like, uh-

Dr. Patti:

Waiting.

619 (SWCC):

Just waiting for the next class to class up. And that was when they classed up obviously, and then, um, they went through their pipeline, they passed tour, they got to where we got, like [crosstalk 00:15:12]

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, and then you joined back in.

619 (SWCC):

... joined back in, and I still failed it.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

And that was like, that was it.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, man.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, that was-

Dr. Patti:

And you can't wait again and try it again, or?

619 (SWCC):

Uh...

Dr. Patti:

Doesn't work like that?

619 (SWCC):

No, it's basically you get rolled twice for performance, or you- you get one performance and one med roll. I got two performance already, and that was like that was it.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

That was pretty much all I was given.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

You know, it's pretty fair, because I did have a long time to train for this.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

I had a while. But it's like, it's like, wow, like training a student is so different than towing an instructor. I could tow anyone all day. You know, you could be heavy, you could fight me, I could tow you.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

But once an instructor... I guess when you include factors of doubt, fear and like you're towing an instructor, like it's not the same thing. Like they are bigger guys at the end of the day. Like they are-

Dr. Patti:

They're heavy. Because they sink, because they're, um, so muscular.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah. Um, so yeah, that happened, and I got dropped. It was a moment where I thought that it was going to be huge for me. I thought it was going to be like a very big hit, but, uh, at the end it was just like I kind of accepted it, because like, well, what else could I have done?

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

You know, I trained so hard for it, and it's like, well, you know, I could blame my size, my weight all day, but it's like, did I try hard enough? Or do- what happened? You know, I can't do anything.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

All I can do now is, what, work on myself now. If I want to get bigger now, I can do that now. You know, get stronger and do that now, and then come back.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

And start over. But it's like, I could do that. I did it once, I'd do it again, so.

Dr. Patti:

Now, are you going to come back? Do you want to come back?

619 (SWCC):

My plans are to come back. But with this thing in Navy that they're making my go, uh, undesignated, um, I'm going to have to do that for a year, I'm guessing.

Dr. Patti:

Huh.

619 (SWCC):

So...

Dr. Patti:

Because the sergeant major, or the-

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, I heard about that.

Dr. Patti:

She said-

619 (SWCC):

They don't want- they don't want to do that no more.

Dr. Patti:

No undesignated, yeah.

619 (SWCC):

They're getting that erased now. But, uh, so that's what I want. Either way I want to [inaudible 00:17:08]. My plan was to come back right away. I wanted to... my plan is to get a job, learn something, learn a skill. Like I'm 24 years old.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

I'm like, I want to learn something before I come back. Like have something under my belt, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Right. Some skill.

619 (SWCC):

Become... yeah, if I want to, you know, learn some leadership skills, go for that. You know, when I come back, you know, I want to be more of a leader, I want to be stronger. I want to know someone- I want to be someone that's accountable, you know, an asset, more than someone that's being carried, or you know... not carried, but like, um, someone that... I want to be that person to help, instead of that person that needs help.

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh. Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

You know?

Dr. Patti:

Good for you.

619 (SWCC):

And I'm that person that's very helpful, like I'm there for you. If you're seen struggling, like I'm going to try my best to get you through.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Right, to help out.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, so, um, what in your life led you to want to be in the Navy?

619 (SWCC):

In the Navy? Uh, I don't know. The military, as a young kid, like I guess was always very fascinating. Seeing people in uniform was pretty cool. Um, but it was not really a thing that was going in my mind throughout my, you know, school years. It wasn't until after I graduated high school, or until I started, you know, like going into, um, criminal justice classes, and to like... and my professor actually, in forensics-

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

... he's the one that actually started sticking that in me.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

He didn't tell me directly, but he influenced me when he told the class like, yo, like if you guys want to pay for college, or if you guys want to, you know, but something on your resume, or something like that, go to the military, it's good if you want to do that. And I'm like, well, that's right, I do want to go to university, I do want to get my college paid for, and I do want to get into law enforcement. And military does seem cool. I guess all those factors weighed in, and that's what like kind of led me more to the military.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

It's crazy how he did that.

Dr. Patti:

I know.

619 (SWCC):

Just by talking about it. He didn't tell me directly, but that was the-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, just by talking about it.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, influenced me to do it. Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Sometimes it's just making people aware that that's an option for them.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

They don't necessarily know. Yeah, for sure. So then, on it- I- I feel like I know some of this already from what you're talking about, but on a day to day basis, like how- what would you say motivates you to, you know, put one foot in front of the other?

619 (SWCC):

So right now it's kind of difficult. Um, I'm not going to lie, I've kind of backtracked a little bit because days are slow, and obviously days at Phoenix, there's not really much activity going on.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). So how long have you been out? H-how long ago did you stop BCS?

619 (SWCC):

Uh, it's been like... like almost three months.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, wow.

619 (SWCC):

It's been a while. It's been a minute already. Yeah, because I had to wait... yeah, it's- it's been a minute because I had to wait for like a job sheet, and then for them to give me... sign a contract and then get orders. And I'm about to leave this week, so it's like...

Dr. Patti:

But you're going to leave this week, but you don't have a job?

619 (SWCC):

No, I'm undesignated air pact.

Dr. Patti:

Uh, you're designated-

619 (SWCC):

Undesignated air pact.

Dr. Patti:

Undesignated air pact.

619 (SWCC):

Air pact.

Dr. Patti:

Which means what?

619 (SWCC):

I'm just undesignated. I have no job, no rank. Like I'm just a seaman in the Navy, just... it sucks. I mean, I get it. Like I know, like when I see it in people's faces, like, you, like I did not want to do this. I'd rather kill myself. Like, okay, that's like too deep.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative). Right, right.

619 (SWCC):

All right, relax. But it's like, the way I see it it's like, you know what, there opportunity- there's an opportunity for me to just, you know, grow. You know? If I could be better as a person, I mean, I would go for it.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, I mean, I guess that's true.

619 (SWCC):

It's going to suck regardless. Like not much is going to go on in this [inaudible 00:20:54].

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Being a seaman, it's just bottom of the barrel, you know, stuff. Um...

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, but... I don't know, I mean, that- that- it's interesting to me, because they told us something different, that no one left, um, undesignated. But, I mean, I- I don't know. They can tell us anything, and we- we don't know.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

All right. So anyways, um, so describe your experience at BUD/S, or I guess in your case BCS?

619 (SWCC):

BCS. BCS, it was a grind, for sure. It was, uh... uh, I've never been (laughs) that, you know, exposed to my emotions-

Dr. Patti:

Yeah (laughs).

619 (SWCC):

... or like really like been expected to do so much, you know. And, uh, I don't know, I'm really bad at expressing my emotions.

Dr. Patti:

You're doing a great job.

619 (SWCC):

You know, it sucks, harder for me to find the- the words [crosstalk 00:21:46]

Dr. Patti:

How long were you in it?

619 (SWCC):

Uh, in BCS?

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh.

619 (SWCC):

Um, well the duration of what, six weeks? That's how long BCS is.

Dr. Patti:

Well, I don't know. You're telling me (laughs).

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, six weeks. It's like four weeks, and then the tour, and then, um, two weeks after that, and then it's BCT.

Dr. Patti:

So- so you were like almost done, is that correct?

619 (SWCC):

With the first phase of training.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, I still needed BCT and CPT, like which is two whole phases.

Dr. Patti:

Okay, so you were at the end of BCS?

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, of selection.

Dr. Patti:

Okay. Um, so when you were in- in this BCS, did you have any difficult decisions that you had to make? Um...

619 (SWCC):

As to what?

Dr. Patti:

Like... so- so the stories I've heard, you know, are mostly things like in BUD, where maybe one person wasn't as strong in the carrying those boats, or whatever, the logs, all those things you have to do, and then like deciding if you wanted to kind of push them out or keep them?

619 (SWCC):

So that's the big difference between the SEAL pipeline and SWCC pipeline.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

I feel like there's more comradery in the SWCC pipeline than there is in the SEAL, and the SEAL pipeline is more dog-eat-dog world, where like if you suck, get out.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Like we don't need you, like you're holding us back. You know, most of the time.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

In the SWCC pipeline, if you suck, it's like, we're going to try to help you out.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

Like you've got to figure it out. It's like, we're there for each other, you know. It's a smaller group. You have- it's- it's different. You have almost 150 plus guys going through selection in the SEAL pipeline, and then you have like 45 guys going through the SWCC pipeline.

Dr. Patti:

Oh. So it's different.

619 (SWCC):

It's different. You know?

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

It's much closer. You're- you're a small group going through a beating, versus a large group going through a beating.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

619 (SWCC):

Because in the SEAL pipeline you might not know someone.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

Like you might be a random person you've never seen. You might be halfway through the training, you're like, oh, I've never seen this face. Like I've never met this guy, I don't even know who he is.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right.

619 (SWCC):

And the SWCC pipeline, you know who everybody is.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

619 (SWCC):

You know everyone. You should know everyone. It's like-

Dr. Patti:

So then in that case, you didn't have any difficult like decisions you had to make, or where you were having a quandary about what do I do here, this or that?

619 (SWCC):

Um, no. No. Obviously we did have talks. We did get mad. There were emotions that, you know, that flew out.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Of course.

619 (SWCC):

And there were people that did say quit and to other people, you know.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

But it was like, after evolution was done, after like we were there behind the boats, you know, waiting for the next evolution, we would talk and be like, yo, like this is what happened, like you need to do better like this, or you- this can't happen again, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

619 (SWCC):

You know, and we would have a talk. You know, so-

Dr. Patti:

And so how many people of the 45 make it?

619 (SWCC):

So usually we start on 45, by the time the tour hits, you'll probably have like 20 guys, and by the time the tour ends you'll probably have like... like anywhere from eight to 12 guys.

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

Almost like 50%, like-

Dr. Patti:

45, 20, and eight, kind of?

619 (SWCC):

Or 12. I'd say 12. Like 12.

Dr. Patti:

Okay, 12.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Give them the benefit of the doubt.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, 12.

Dr. Patti:

Wow, that's incredible. Um, okay, so, um, then it says here, anything that you would- would have done differently in BCS. If you could do it all over again, what might you have changed?

619 (SWCC):

Take on more of a leadership role, for sure.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, okay.

619 (SWCC):

Instead of being the behind the scenes guy, be more upfront, deal more with the instructors. Last time around like I was not- I was not going to be the guy in front talking with the instructors. That was not happening, you know what I mean?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

It takes guts to be in that position. Like you- it's- it's pretty tough.

Dr. Patti:

Putting yourself out there. Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

Yeah. Whatever goes wrong is your fault, like it's pretty much how it goes. But, uh, if I could be a boat crew leader, that would be something I would strive- go for, you know.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Help my guys out.

Dr. Patti:

Right, help everybody. Yeah, yeah.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You seem like that kind of guy.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

And then, I guess, t-the next question is, would you consider coming back? My- my guess is yes, you want to come back.

619 (SWCC):

For sure.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, for sure.

619 (SWCC):

Now, it's going to take a couple of years, and obviously a lot of things happen in a couple of years, but I'm very like decided that I do want to come back.

Dr. Patti:

Right. Right, yeah, I, um, I agree with you on that, for sure. Now, did you do anything like, uh, mental, physical, spiritual practice that sort of helped you, you know, wreck in order your brain at the end of a really difficult day, or anything like that, that kind of helped you reset, or during the difficulties?

619 (SWCC):

That's very interesting, because every other morning I wanted to quit (laughs).

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

I- I did. Like just waking up, it's like, wow, like I don't want to do this anymore. Like it- it sucks. Like I'm going to have to go out there, it's going to be cold, I don't want to run, I don't want to do this. And it's just like, you just go back. Like, well, back home I would do things that suck, and I would still do it, and I was by myself. I had the option to say no, and no one would know.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

No one would know that I'm like blagging, no one would know that I- I say like... I could say I did all this, but literally no I didn't do anything, you know.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

But now here it's like it's a real thing. I don't have... if I say no, it's because I quit on myself already. It's like, it's not going to happen.

Dr. Patti:

So what made you get out of your head in the morning and- and get yourself out there then?

619 (SWCC):

Well, number one, I woke up really early.

Dr. Patti:

Okay.

619 (SWCC):

I woke up really early. Like I just woke up, took a shower or just brushed my teeth, little things.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

You know, wake up and just lay in my room, just like just look up and then knowing that... you know, just having that extra rest, just like it brought me back a little bit. I still felt pretty bad, but it was just enough for me to get out the door, put my ruc on, just get out- get out there.

Dr. Patti:

Right, right. I can do this. I can do it. I can...

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah. Wow. That's cool. Um, and then, um, h-has this changed you? I mean I- I feel like-

619 (SWCC):

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

... I feel like you've answered that already, but- but just to put it in words, like how has this changed you as a person?

619 (SWCC):

Uh, it's changed me in a person where like I'm literally like imposs- like that's why I'm not scared to do these things.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

Like- like, okay, you could do this to me, okay, it's fine. It's okay, I'll be fine.

Dr. Patti:

Right. I'll be fine. I can do it.

619 (SWCC):

I'll figure life out, like it's okay. You know, it's...

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

I'm not scared of what's going to happen. You know, it's going to suck, but it's okay.

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

You know?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Like I already done something that's so bad, it's what else can you do to me? Like you can't. You can't. It's like, it's okay.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs) Yeah. Okay, so then, now we're sort of at the end of the questions, and so then our last question is, what... are there any things that you think are critically important in- in this sort of an environment, that we haven't really asked about, that you think might inform our interest, you know, at a different...

619 (SWCC):

Like, uh, like, um, like what? Like...

Dr. Patti:

Well, I don't know, like, you know, should we ask, you know, if your mother has a horn growing out of her head?

619 (SWCC):

(laughs).

Dr. Patti:

I mean, I- I don't know, whatever. I mean, like should we ask questions that we're not asking, that might reveal information to us that would be helpful for our study? Uh...

619 (SWCC):

Like were they doubting themselves from the beginning, like did they really want to do this?

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

Like- like during bootcamp, they were having second thoughts. Or, you know, like because some guys are very capable of doing it. Like I have friends that would, like for example, it wasn't BUD/S or SWCC, but like people that would go out for air rescue. Guys, fully capable, you know, even better than me at running, better than me at swimming, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Very capable physically, you know. I would take them out with me to work out, and I would take them out to do tough work outs, and they- they would be fine. You know, obviously they'll be right behind me, but they'll be resil- they'll resist. They'll, you know, they would never back out, like, oh, I can't today. Like every time I tell them, they'd say [inaudible 00:29:37]

Dr. Patti:

Uh-huh.

619 (SWCC):

And then it's like, now I hear back from them and they quit right before even going to the actual training. It's like... and it baffles me, because it's like, wow, you- you showed me that you could do it.

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

Like you're very capable of doing it. I thought you were- like I legitimately, I didn't even doubt you. Like I really believed in you, and like- and he quit because he got scared off in bootcamp. Still, I don't know if you ever heard off of, um-

Dr. Patti:

Wow.

619 (SWCC):

Diagonal? Ever heard of diagonal?

Dr. Patti:

Uh-uh.

619 (SWCC):

Diagonal is basically a training. They don't have it anymore, I think. But, uh, it's like this training you would go to in bootcamp, where you would see like some like, uh, SO like or SWCC team guys who would like run the evolutions, or basic- or sometimes, uh, air rescue people would run them.

Dr. Patti:

Oh, wow.

619 (SWCC):

And they would go in a pool and do treading. And it would suck. Th-these evolutions would suck, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

And they were good because they would scare people off. Like it would be hard, and it's like people get in their heads like, oh, wow, this is hard now, just imagine when I get over [inaudible 00:30:36]. It's like, no, this isn't getting... you know, it's- it's not...

Dr. Patti:

And so- and so then the question I guess that we could ask is, did you doubt yourself at any time, or something like that? I mean, that's kind of what you're getting at, is people doubt themselves, and then they-

619 (SWCC):

Yeah, they- they eat themselves alive before they even struggle with the real thing.

Dr. Patti:

(laughs).

619 (SWCC):

Like, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Yeah.

619 (SWCC):

That's the thing I learned myself. I- I did that myself. Like I did that when I was going through EMT.

Dr. Patti:

Mm-hmm (affirmative).

619 (SWCC):

Like when I was doing my clinical run, like when I do my clinical shift-

Dr. Patti:

Right.

619 (SWCC):

... because [inaudible 00:31:06] I'm like, wow, I don't want to be here. I don't want to do this. Like, I don't think I can do this. Like I- I would talk to patients, and it's like, I can't. And that- and I- I notice that now. I told myself I can't, I told myself that I would fail, and look at me, I failed.

Dr. Patti:

Oh.

619 (SWCC):

So like I basically tore myself down. So like I told myself I would never do that again. I'm just not going to do it, because it will be so destructive, you know?

Dr. Patti:

Yeah, but you know, that's a- that's a real thing.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Like you're not the only person.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You know what I mean? Like there's this whole like body of theory out there, identity theory, like where you- you doubt that you're really... imposter, it's called imposter syndrome.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Where you doubt your-

619 (SWCC):

Abilities.

Dr. Patti:

... your ability to do that.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

You know, it's a real thing. You're not alone.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

But that's very interesting.

619 (SWCC):

Yeah.

Dr. Patti:

Um, okay. So those are all my questions.

619 (SWCC):

Okay.

Dr. Patti:

Um, let me just shut this off. But I've got to tell you that, um-
